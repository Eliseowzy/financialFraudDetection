utilities impacted by the ruling appear to have been caught offguard AEP Entergy and Southern Company all issued st atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t he ruling would impact them and that they were reserving the right for pos sible litigation Moreover to summarize the commissions rulemaking I think there are a han dful of important points that should be considered First the ruling illus trates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke marketprice authority that was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed his post as chairman Second FERC is implementing costbased prices on the spot market only and in only very defined circumstances However this co uld be an indication that the commission may extend costbased pricing to o ther wholesale transactions including longterm contracts at a later time Third the split the savings costbased formula could become fraught wi th its own problems Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov er power sellers which will now be required to post incremental costs in t he bidding process Finally one of the inherent drivers of FERCs new ruli ng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission has approved It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact s AEP Entergy and Southern Company utilities that have not only been deem ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a lso not yet joined an approved RTO However even though only three compani es are immediately impacted by this ruling it should not be overlooked tha t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain areas Thus overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power market are conducted An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We

IATESTCornerBLjpg escientechcomIATESTCornerBRjpg November New Power Plant Planned for New York City By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Energy Info Source New York states siting board approved Astoria Energys plans to build a megawatt power plant in New York Ci ty clearing the way for construction to begin as early as January Astoria Energy hopes to have the naturalgasfired combinedcycle plant that will be at an existing oil terminal in the Astoria section of Queens in service by The company must do a certain amount of demolition and site prepa ration before it can begin construction and still must receive some local permits from New York City Astoria Energy is a unit of SCS Energy LLC a p rivately owned energy development company based in Concord Mass Analysis The announcement of a new power plant scheduled for the New York City area should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply pro blems that have been identified within this region Like California New Yo rk also suffers from a supply demand imbalance However even if or when power supply can be increased in New York the core load center of New York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue t o take their own toll on the stability of the market In other words trans mission capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the e xtent that power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported The fact that Astoria Energy has received approval from New York states siting boar d to proceed with this New York Citybased plant is significant but it sho uld not be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from city government This could be easier said than done as other planned powe r plants in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the la st year by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who a rdently voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new p lant construction The problems within the New York power market have been well documented Th e state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant online since when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven years s ince a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate Further New York expects only a percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years Consequently concerns about the states abil ity to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for sitin g new plants in the state However at the same time environmental and com munity groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby fo r limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages the problem app ears to be particularly acute in New York City A November report issu ed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC entitled Investigati on of Bulk Power Markets Northeast Region highlighted specific capacity problems in the New York CityLong Island community of million people T hese areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the states grid the study said Like Northern California which suffer ed rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints New York City and Lon g Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained transmi ssion lines Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York but cannot reach the city Being both densely populated and heavily residen tial it is difficult to site new power plants in the area Consequently percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the city New plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because New Yo rk City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at times during the course of The projected shortfall is expected to increase by another MW by summer Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N ew York City and New York State Demand in the state rose by MW from to or times as fast as new generation capacity was added De mand over the course of was expected to reach MW or about percent above regulators earlier forecasts It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will proceed with its plans for the new power plant in New York City Astoria Energy is a private company seeking to generate electric power with energyefficient and envir onmentally sound technologies in the New York City area The company is a s ubsidiary of SCS Energy a privately owned energy development company forme d in for the purpose of developing and owning new electric generating facilities Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds some additional light on the proposed plant As noted the MW unit will be a natural gasfired facility which will obtain natural gas supplied from the ConEdN ew York facility pipeline The capital cost for the plant reportedly will b e million Commercial operation pending the necessary approvals on th e local level is scheduled for the fourth quarter of Astoria Energy is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for the new plant be cause it will be using a technology that is specifically geared toward the reduction of air emissions However despite this optimism the community opposition factor should not be discounted and there are several examples that may foreshadow the oppos ition that Astoria Energy could face Take Sithe Energies for example whi ch hit a roadblock with its construction plans in the New York area earlier this year Sithe Energies originally planned a MW combinedcycle facil ity fueled by natural gas in Ramapo NY Chief among the concerns of local residents is that the Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the t ime to meet demand and as a result would use local water resources for coo ling purposes Community resistance thus became an issue for the company w hich altered its plans and began to consider a MW peaking unit also po wered by natural gas that would only be operated in times of increased dem and As another example environmental and community groups won a victory in cou rt just last week that essentially will block construction of small power p lants in the South Bronx Brooklyn Queens and Long Island areas Each is a MW plant though at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than MW A coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in these areas and sued the New York Power Authority claimi ng among other things that the state had failed to perform adequate envir onmentalreview studies The groups claim that the state should test the pl ants for their output of fine particulate matter A lower court had ruled i n favor of the state but a judgment last week in the New York Court of App eals was clearly a win for the environmental and community groups The new ruling which reportedly cannot be appealed further says that the state mu st do unprecedented air tests at the plants or shut them down by Jan In a report issued earlier this year New York State Electric Gas Corp NYSEG one of New Yorks seven utilities said the state will not have eno ugh megawatts to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market unti l NYSEG in a report issued late Wednesday warned there are serious problems with New Yorks generation supply and a lack of transmission an d pipeline infrastructure According to data included in a separate report by the New York ISO which manages the states transmission grid between and while statewide demand in New York rose by MW generat ing capacity under contract in the state reportedly increased only by MW Consequently given all of these factors power supplies in New York remain ed strained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of n ew generation capacity However Astoria Energy which seeks to bring new g eneration online in New York that will be based on clean technologies may still face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the c onstruction of any new plants in the region with the exception of peaker u nits whose output would be closely regimented If plans for this plant ar e blocked or significantly altered following the experience of Sithe Energ ies the options to resolve New York Citys supply demand imbalance will once again become focused on a combination of other approaches including c onservation efforts and reliance on distributed generation alternatives An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We

utilities impacted by the ruling appear to have been caught offguard AEP Entergy and Southern Company all issued st atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t he ruling would impact them and that they were reserving the right for pos sible litigation Moreover to summarize the commissions rulemaking I think there are a han dful of important points that should be considered First the ruling illus trates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke marketprice authority that was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed his post as chairman Second FERC is implementing costbased prices on the spot market only and in only very defined circumstances However this co uld be an indication that the commission may extend costbased pricing to o ther wholesale transactions including longterm contracts at a later time Third the split the savings costbased formula could become fraught wi th its own problems Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov er power sellers which will now be required to post incremental costs in t he bidding process Finally one of the inherent drivers of FERCs new ruli ng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission has approved It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact s AEP Entergy and Southern Company utilities that have not only been deem ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a lso not yet joined an approved RTO However even though only three compani es are immediately impacted by this ruling it should not be overlooked tha t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain areas Thus overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power market are conducted An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We

Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Dow Jones The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission F ERC kicks off a week of workshops today as part of its effort to reframe r ules requiring utilities to turn control of their powergrid assets to inde pendent management The controversial effort to carve up the nations elect ricity system under control of four or five regional transmission organizat ions RTOs is a top objective for FERC Chairman Pat Wood III The workshop s dubbed RTO Week were called by FERC to garner what Wood calls buy in for the effort which is encountering stiff opposition from some utilitie s state regulators and members of Congress Analysis The objective of this weeks workshops may be to gain support fro m the industry for FERCs controversial mandate but they are also having t he effect of casting light on what is a growing debate over FERCs jurisdic tional boundaries The issue has become rather evenly divided On one side critics say that FERC has gone too far in its most recent RTO order which as noted has become somewhat of a cause clbre for new Chairman Wood O n the other hand supporters say Wood has breathed new life into the commis sion and is taking an important step to ensure equal access for all power s uppliers into the nations transmission system By Woods own directive th e discrepancy over how far FERC can extend its regulatory oversight into wh at were previously considered state or utility matters is reaching a boilin g point as a Dec deadline that carries stiff penalties for resistant u tilities is fast approaching Certainly the arrival of Pat Wood as FERC chairman after replacing Curt H bert last month has signaled a new era for the federal commission which oversees much of the energy industrys wholesale market and the nations po wer grid As noted Pat Wood has made the formation of RTOs one of his key objectives Wood recently demonstrated that FERC would become much more int erventionist when he declared a deadline of Dec by which time transmis sionowning electric utilities across the country must submit plans to join an existing RTO in one of four large regional entities Using what he has referred to as a big stick Wood warned that failing to comply with the D ec deadline would cost transmissionowning utilities their right to cha rge marketbased rates for power and could delay any merger proceedings in which the utilities might become engaged This issue alone has drawn a line in the sand but has also sparked an inte nse debate on the regulatory power that FERC should be given in the deregul ating energy market Standing up to lead the effort to put more constraints on FERCs authority are many state regulatory officials and congressional leaders who view the commission as stepping into areas in which they tradi tionally have been the sole jurisdictional gatekeepers State regulators p articularly from Southern states where electricity prices remain comparativ ely low argue that that their system is working just fine the way it is S uch states want to retain their present regulatory oversight rather than c ompletely forfeit control of these assets over to FERC and also believe t hat now is not the time to be making huge changes to the way in which the n ations transmission system is managed Also in question is the extent to w hich regulatory conflicts may arise between state and federal commissioners if FERC is successful in mandating very large and broad RTOs that transcen d state boundaries Southern Company is one utility that has refuted FERCs authority to force it to participate in an RTO In its July order FERC directed Southern Comp any along with the Southwest Power Pool Entergy Corp and Grid South to form a single RTO for the Southeast region most likely adopting a structur e modeled after Grid South However Southern Company already has sunk abou t billion into its own mile system over which it wants to retain independent control FERC has said that the formation of regional RTOs will result in significan t cost savings for customers because the barriers to competitively priced e lectricity will be removed and transmission costs will be reduced However Southern Company claims that the cost to establish a large regional RTO co uld run as high as million which could be passed on to customers in t he form of higher rates Southern also disagrees with FERC from a philosoph ical point of view and questions whether or not the commissions vision of four regional RTOs will truly make transmission activity more efficient On e of Southerns concerns is that the four regional RTOs could become too la rge and end up operating like monopolies Ironically the issue has caused dissension between Southern and its former subsidiary Mirant which as an i ndependent power producer seeks equal access to the transmission grid Whil e Southern disagrees with FERCs authority to force RTO participation Mira nt supports the federal governments efforts to streamline transmission act ivity Leaders of RTO Westthe transmission entity in which FERC wants to include the transmission assets of states in the Northwest Southwest and Californi aalso question the value of a large regional entity and are resisting FERC s authority to mandate this structure Leaders in the region have said tha t the formation of RTO West would result in substantially higher rates con sidering that the Northwest transmission grid currently lacks the capacity to meet high demand in the area In other words although FERC may be endor sing marketbased rates for those transmissionowning utilities that join R TOs some transmission grids remain unstable and may not be ready for incre ased activity Nevertheless along with Mirant stand fellow generating companies such as D ynegy and Enron which have sunk billions into building merchant facilities and want to ensure that they have access to transmission systems Hence t hese companies agree with FERCs emphasis on RTO formations as generation companies want to ensure that control of transmission facilities is moved f rom utilities to independent management companies In addition to the RTO issue the bankruptcy proceedings of Pacific Gas E lectric Co have also brought the issue of state versus federal jurisdictio nal authority to a head The utilitys parent PGE Corp is pursuing a rin g fencing strategy in the restructuring related to the bankruptcy proceedi ngs of Pacific Gas Electric Co Put simply PGE Corp is trying to prote ct other valuable assets by transferring them into a new federally regulat ed subsidiary The restructuring plan has raised jurisdictional issues beca use the California Public Utility Commission which presently regulates the utility operations of Pacific Gas Electric Co believes that it has the right to approve the transfer of assets into a new subsidiary Further th e state government in California believes that PGE Corps plan would give too much regulatory control to FERC and by the same token reduce the amou nt of control that California would have over generation assets that are pr esently contained in a regulated subsidiary The complicated issues surrounding how far FERC should be allowed to extend its regulatory authority are presently working their way through the feder al legal system In fact last week the Supreme Court began hearing argumen ts from federal lawyers state regulators and private industry addressing not only FERCs authority to mandate RTOs but also the commissions or der that required utilities to provide equal access to their transmission s ystems Measures are also moving through Congress that would clarify the Fe deral Power Act to explicitly give FERC the authority to mandate participat ion in an RTO At present the commission had danced around the issue by ca lling for voluntary participation yet still affixing stiff penalties for utilities that refuse to comply In addition Rep Joe Barton RTexas chairman of the Energy and Air Qual ity Subcommittee is reportedly working on a broad electric restructuring b ill that he hopes to introduce during this congressional session which cou ld prove difficult as legislators want to close the current session by earl y November Barton is a strong supporter of RTOs and his draft bill repor tedly would give FERC the ability to order RTO membership for public and pr ivate utilities that own power lines At the same time however it is beli eved that Bartons draft bill would give utilities the option for an expedi ted federal court hearing if they disagree with FERCs order which again w ould further temper the extent to which FERC has unrestricted authority on transmission issues Moreover Congress and federal courtrooms may be the best venues for this d ebate over FERCs authority as disputes between state and federal regulator y oversight are sure to increase as thorny deregulation issues emerge Howe ver given FERCs deadline of Dec for RTO participation the issue has gained a sense of urgency as big utilities such as Southern Company dig in their heels and rebuff the federal commissions mandate An

Energys stock value dropped to its lowest level in seven yearsdown nearly percent in one day and down over percent si nce May But perhaps what is most important about Constellation is its shift in business strategy as it becomes the second company of the week to announce it is withdrawing plans to split its company into two parts E arlier in the week Allegheny Energy NYSEAYE announced it would hold off on its planned initial public offering IPO of Allegheny Energy Supply Com pany its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary until market conditions improve The dramatic shift in

the business and million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business conti nued Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will cau se the company to record a million special expense in the fourth quart er The company said that its splitup with Goldman Sachs was amicable Gol dmans relationship with Constellation started in the midnineties when the investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the energy trading and marketing business In Goldman agreed it would take a percent stake in Constellations trading business when the state of Maryl and deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a sepa rate trading company Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want to be part of a situation where energy trading and

range of to per share Despite the strong earnings Alleghenys stock price has dropped over pe rcent since May and over percent in the past trading days The drop i n energy stock value appears to be

energy analyst with ABN Amr o said there are common themes affecting the industry One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them And two is lower sto ck prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth AES Corp NYSEAES apparently agrees Its earnings fell for a second co nsecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain and said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out s elling off assets AES Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AES was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable longterm c ontract generation business By placing generating capacity into longterm contracts a company is able to provide profit stability during times of fla t growth Just one year ago physical reserve margins in power markets were very low allowing generation companies to achieve high profits for their p roduct But with the slowing economy mild weather and consumer response to the higher prices power demand for is flat or even down from one yea r ago in many parts of the country The recent actions of Constellation Allegheny and AES likely indicate a fu ndamental shift in the electric

companies are once again rethinking their strategy in regard to w hether or not they will continue to be an integrated business As Constella tion concluded one way to achieve and maintain a critical

headlinesheadlinesaspsource HOUSTON CBSMW In the wake of the Sept terrorist attacks one of the few places to buy or sell jet fuel was an online market maintained by Enron The attacks highlighted the Houston companys strength as a manager of risk during periods of heightened uncertainty Through its trading centers the company gives customers a way to hedge against volatility in oil natural gas and electricity markets as well as other commodities Although the company lost one employee aboard one of the hijacked planes and closed its operations on the day of the attacks its trading activity resumed the next day By coming back online so fast we made the decision to provide some stability in the market said Vance Meyer an Enron spokesman The customers really appreciated the fact that we were there providing a place for them to maintain and adjust their positions in the market In a financial sense Enron ENE toolsquotesdetailaspviewdetailsymbENE didnt suffer Meyer said But employees at the Enron Building in downtown Houston were badly shaken Nick Humber who worked for Enrons wind energy business died aboard a Los Angeles bound flight that crashed into the World Trade Center We have offices in Washington and New York and people who had friends that died or were affected in some way Meyer said We also had traders who were on the phone with people in the World Trade Center when the planes hit The decision to temporarily halt commodity trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the wake of the attacks may have increased volatility a boon to the group said Bob Christensen analyst at FACEquities Companies that can defray volatility by helping customers manage their energy costs should be seeing a lot of business he said Managing risk is what Enron does best market players say And that strength should help the company going forward as US businesses try to recover from the impact of September Through its EnronOnline platform the company buys and sells commodities at volumes totaling about billion a day Meyer said The world at large has become more risk averse and Enron which is in the business of risk mitigation should benefit from that said Glen Hilton senior analyst and portfolio manager for the Montgomery New Power Fund which has a stake in Enron With energy risk and prices potentially going up theyll be the first number on many CFOs speed dial Other companies do what Enron does but its the best positioned to succeed because of its status as the leader in natural gas and power trading measured in terms of volume Duke Energy DUK toolsquotesdetailaspviewdetailsymbDUK is the nextlargest competitor but it has onethird of Enrons volume High profile departure Thats a good place to be for a company whose stock price has been on the skids since last year though it grew percent on the top line in Other problems notwithstanding including its moneylosing broadband business and its failure to sell the Oregon utility Portland General Electric Enrons largest black eye came in midAugust when Jeffrey Skilling chief executive since February resigned abruptly toolsquotesintchartaspsymbENE John Hammerschmidt senior portfolio manager of the Turner New Energy and Power Technology Fund said he freaked out when Skilling left and managers immediately divested the Turner largecap portfolios of Enron holdings Despite its status as a growth player Turner had reentered the stock in June after a long absence because of valuation At the time Enron was trading in the mid to high s This is a premier company and a premier industry he said adding that he believed then that the market had priced rumors into the stock One of the rumors was that Enron was about to take a big loss from being long on power when power prices were collapsing Hammerschmidt said That has not materialized Whatever the problems were Hammerschmidt said he felt them to be manageable When Skilling walked out Hammerschmidt began to believe some of the rumors might be true In our experience when somebody in power leaves for no reason theres uncertainty and uncertainty makes growth guys real nervous he said Management continuity Now hes looking to get back in Enron he said works in both down and up markets Enrons earnings are more solid today than theyve ever beenand theyre valuable because were becoming a digital economy he said We need highquality power and local power plants have trouble providing reliability Enron is focused on guaranteeing people quality power in times of stress on the system Of course theres still the issue about trusting management After Skilling left Enron promoted Greg Whalley to president and chief operating officer and Mark Frevert to vice chairman You cannot expect Whalley and Frevert to articulate the Enron vision the way Jeffrey did Christensen said They may grow into it On the upside Skilling predecessor Ken Lay who Wall Street credits with building Enron into a powerhouse is back at the helm and he has promised to remain at the post until a solid succession plan is in place We have a great deal of confidence in Mr Ken Lay as he was the original architect of ENEs and for that matter the entire industrys tremendous transformation for the past decade Merrill Lynch stated in a research report the day after Skilling left Enron Whats more Ken Lay has promised more transparency at Enron more insight into how the company makes money which will help Hilton said Trying to forecast Enrons earnings is difficult Christensen said that a lack of data and clarity in regard to Enrons wholesale operations has been an issue in the past Enron has promised to provide more information when it reports its thirdquarter results on October Ultimately only time will assuage investors concerns But with the prospects that Enron has the stock is a deal right now Hammerschmidt said I dont know what gets people back but buy Enron at and in a year youre making money he said I can see the stock

IATESTCornerBLjpg escientechcomIATESTCornerBRjpg November New Power Plant Planned for New York City By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Energy Info Source New York states siting board approved Astoria Energys plans to build a megawatt power plant in New York Ci ty clearing the way for construction to begin as early as January Astoria Energy hopes to have the naturalgasfired combinedcycle plant that will be at an existing oil terminal in the Astoria section of Queens in service by The company must do a certain amount of demolition and site prepa ration before it can begin construction and still must receive some local permits from New York City Astoria Energy is a unit of SCS Energy LLC a p rivately owned energy development company based in Concord Mass Analysis The announcement of a new power plant scheduled for the New York City area should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply pro blems that have been identified within this region Like California New Yo rk also suffers from a supply demand imbalance However even if or when power supply can be increased in New York the core load center of New York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue t o take their own toll on the stability of the market In other words trans mission capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the e xtent that power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported The fact that Astoria Energy has received approval from New York states siting boar d to proceed with this New York Citybased plant is significant but it sho uld not be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from city government This could be easier said than done as other planned powe r plants in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the la st year by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who a rdently voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new p lant construction The problems within the New York power market have been well documented Th e state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant online since when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven years s ince a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate Further New York expects only a percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years Consequently concerns about the states abil ity to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for sitin g new plants in the state However at the same time environmental and com munity groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby fo r limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages the problem app ears to be particularly acute in New York City A November report issu ed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC entitled Investigati on of Bulk Power Markets Northeast Region highlighted specific capacity problems in the New York CityLong Island community of million people T hese areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the states grid the study said Like Northern California which suffer ed rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints New York City and Lon g Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained transmi ssion lines Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York but cannot reach the city Being both densely populated and heavily residen tial it is difficult to site new power plants in the area Consequently percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the city New plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because New Yo rk City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at times during the course of The projected shortfall is expected to increase by another MW by summer Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N ew York City and New York State Demand in the state rose by MW from to or times as fast as new generation capacity was added De mand over the course of was expected to reach MW or about percent above regulators earlier forecasts It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will proceed with its plans for the new power plant in New York City Astoria Energy is a private company seeking to generate electric power with energyefficient and envir onmentally sound technologies in the New York City area The company is a s ubsidiary of SCS Energy a privately owned energy development company forme d in for the purpose of developing and owning new electric generating facilities Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds some additional light on the proposed plant As noted the MW unit will be a natural gasfired facility which will obtain natural gas supplied from the ConEdN ew York facility pipeline The capital cost for the plant reportedly will b e million Commercial operation pending the necessary approvals on th e local level is scheduled for the fourth quarter of Astoria Energy is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for the new plant be cause it will be using a technology that is specifically geared toward the reduction of air emissions However despite this optimism the community opposition factor should not be discounted and there are several examples that may foreshadow the oppos ition that Astoria Energy could face Take Sithe Energies for example whi ch hit a roadblock with its construction plans in the New York area earlier this year Sithe Energies originally planned a MW combinedcycle facil ity fueled by natural gas in Ramapo NY Chief among the concerns of local residents is that the Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the t ime to meet demand and as a result would use local water resources for coo ling purposes Community resistance thus became an issue for the company w hich altered its plans and began to consider a MW peaking unit also po wered by natural gas that would only be operated in times of increased dem and As another example environmental and community groups won a victory in cou rt just last week that essentially will block construction of small power p lants in the South Bronx Brooklyn Queens and Long Island areas Each is a MW plant though at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than MW A coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in these areas and sued the New York Power Authority claimi ng among other things that the state had failed to perform adequate envir onmentalreview studies The groups claim that the state should test the pl ants for their output of fine particulate matter A lower court had ruled i n favor of the state but a judgment last week in the New York Court of App eals was clearly a win for the environmental and community groups The new ruling which reportedly cannot be appealed further says that the state mu st do unprecedented air tests at the plants or shut them down by Jan In a report issued earlier this year New York State Electric Gas Corp NYSEG one of New Yorks seven utilities said the state will not have eno ugh megawatts to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market unti l NYSEG in a report issued late Wednesday warned there are serious problems with New Yorks generation supply and a lack of transmission an d pipeline infrastructure According to data included in a separate report by the New York ISO which manages the states transmission grid between and while statewide demand in New York rose by MW generat ing capacity under contract in the state reportedly increased only by MW Consequently given all of these factors power supplies in New York remain ed strained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of n ew generation capacity However Astoria Energy which seeks to bring new g eneration online in New York that will be based on clean technologies may still face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the c onstruction of any new plants in the region with the exception of peaker u nits whose output would be closely regimented If plans for this plant ar e blocked or significantly altered following the experience of Sithe Energ ies the options to resolve New York Citys supply demand imbalance will once again become focused on a combination of other approaches including c onservation efforts and

IATESTCornerBLjpg escientechcomIATESTCornerBRjpg November FERC Enacts Major Constraints on Wholesale Market By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis AEP Entergy Corp and Southern Company told by FERC to charge costbased p rices instead of marketbased prices for wholesale spot transactions News item from Reuters The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FER C voted last week to adopt new rules to measure market power as a con dition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade powe r in the wholesale market FERC commissioners said the new test would impro ve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market last winter when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight supplies FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base d on supply margin assessments which examines a companys importance in se rving peak electricity loads If youre big enough to control the market a t the time we look at it youll have mitigation put on you said FERC Cha irman Pat Wood Analysis Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry are still reeling from FERCs new ruling which may have slipped past some radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday weekend This is a mammoth ruling on FERCs part however and it holds tre mendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lions share of their profits coming from wholesale transactions In addition state reg ulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin king profits in their wholesale operations While FERC has presented this r uling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience d in the California market the new limits on wholesale transactions can al so be seen as another example of the big stick that the commission is usi ng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat ions RTO Further the ruling is another striking indication that Chairma n Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m arkets while still attempting to support competition The objective represe nts a tall order and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom pt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading Put into a nutshell FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charg e unregulated marketbased rates for spot market wholesale transactions I nstead companies identified as having market power and that arent part of an approved RTO must charge costbased prices for power that isnt committ ed in a longterm contract and publicly disclose those costbased prices Columbus Ohiobased American Electric Power NYSE AEP Atlantabased Sou thern Company NYSE SO and New Orleansbased Entergy Corp NYSE ETR ha ve been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately apply ing its new standards for wholesale transactions Note that Mirant Corp a former subsidiary of Southern Company has also been identified as having to submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power s eparate from its former parent The commission has essentially determined t hat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the areas in which they operate Under FERCs new market power test a gener ator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici ty is pivotal during peak demand which enables the company to demand a p rice above competitive levels Regional transmission constraints will also be considered now as a measurement of a companys market power This is a d ramatic departure from previous standards by which under one of FERCs ma in criterions a company that supplied less than percent of the power ne eded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l evel There are some important exceptions to the ruling First FERC has not elim inated the utilities ability to charge marketbased rates in areas where t he grid and markets are controlled by a FERCapproved RTO This is signific ant as I will expand upon subsequently because it indicates that there ar e secondary objectives in FERCs new ruling In addition the current rulin g only impacts shortterm sales transactions in which these three utilities are involved In other words longterm contracts that the three companies may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im pacted by the ruling However the three companies named in the ruling will have to post pricing information related to longterm contracts and FERC has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for longterm co ntracts may be necessary Also note that the Western market which already is under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June was not inclu ded in the new ruling The three utilities named in the ruling now have days to submit proposal s to FERC outlining a transition to charging costbased wholesale rates for all power not currently committed to a buyer Specifically the utilities will have to post on their openaccess sametime information systems OASIS the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour in a hour period Moving forward the price that the utilities can charg e for noncommitted power on the spot market will be the difference between their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region that their power displaces The new costbased rates must be administered by an independent third party The new pricing standards revert back to an older costbased technique kno wn as split the savings The methodology for this standard can get rather complicated but essentially under FERCs new ruling the three companies i dentified will have to post their costbased incremental costs for spot po wer into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases Purchasers wh o want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci ng or buying the power on their own The final price for the transactions w ill be the split between the sellers incremental cost and the buyers decr emental bid For instance if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at MWh the transact ion price would be MWh Assuming a midnighttomidnight trading day se llers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da y and buyers would submit their decremental bids by pm What this potent ially creates is an information advantage for buyers who have six hours t o evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers Some of t he drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th e purchaser to game the system by having access to the sellers original in cremental bid and competing around the sellers price Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section of the Federal Power Act to apply the new marketbasedsales policy to all US sellers nationwide What this means i s that although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it b elieves to be erratic wholesale markets Reportedly some companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes th ey exert market power The investigation reportedly also requires power providers with marketbased sales authority to amend their tariffs within days to provide FERC with openended authority to order refunds if the c ommission determines that market manipulation has occurred I made a previous reference to the big stick that FERC is carrying relate d to participation in RTOs Remember that a few months ago Chairman Wood h ad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of charging marketbased wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli cations advantages that the chairman equated with the new world of the d eregulated energy market With this in mind note that only Southern Compan y Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling although it may be s ubsequently expanded Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhi bited some resistance in following FERCs consolidation mandate regarding n ational RTOs so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti lities have been singled out This must be particularly painful for Souther n Company which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an d previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov er the next five years Interestingly Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single diss enting vote in the ruling Breathitts concern was that the ruling had been pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu ate the impact on wholesale markets This issue will undoubtedly be contest ed and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to have been caught offguard AEP Entergy and Southern Company all issued st atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t he ruling would impact them and that they were reserving the right for pos sible litigation Moreover to summarize the commissions rulemaking I think there are a han dful of important points that should be considered First the ruling illus trates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke marketprice authority that was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed his post as chairman Second FERC is implementing costbased prices on the spot market only and in only very defined circumstances However this co uld be an indication that the commission may extend costbased pricing to o ther wholesale transactions including longterm contracts at a later time Third the split the savings costbased formula could become fraught wi th its own problems Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov er power sellers which will now be required to post incremental costs in t he bidding process Finally one of the inherent drivers of FERCs new ruli ng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission has approved It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact s AEP Entergy and Southern Company utilities that have not only been deem ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a lso not yet joined an approved RTO However even though only three compani es are immediately impacted by this ruling it should not be overlooked tha t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain areas Thus overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power market are conducted An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We

However despite this optimism the community opposition factor should not be discounted and there are several examples that may foreshadow the oppos ition that Astoria Energy could face Take Sithe Energies for example whi ch hit a roadblock with its construction plans in the New York area earlier this year Sithe Energies originally planned a MW combinedcycle facil ity fueled by natural gas in Ramapo NY Chief among the concerns of local residents is that the Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the t ime to meet demand and as a result would use local water resources for coo ling purposes Community resistance thus became an issue for the company w hich altered its plans and began to consider a MW peaking unit also po wered by natural gas that would only be operated in times of increased dem and As another example environmental and community groups won a victory in cou rt just last week that essentially will block construction of small power p lants in the South Bronx Brooklyn Queens and Long Island areas Each is a MW plant though at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than MW A coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in these areas and sued the New York Power Authority claimi ng among other things that the state had failed to perform adequate envir onmentalreview studies The groups claim that the state should test the pl ants for their output of fine particulate matter A lower court had ruled i n favor of the state but a judgment last week in the New York Court of App eals was clearly a win for the environmental and community groups The new ruling which reportedly cannot be appealed further says that the state mu st do unprecedented air tests at the plants or shut them down by Jan In a report issued earlier this year New York State Electric Gas Corp NYSEG one of New Yorks seven utilities said the state will not have eno ugh megawatts to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market unti l NYSEG in a report issued late Wednesday warned there are serious problems with New Yorks generation supply and a lack of transmission an d pipeline infrastructure According to data included in a separate report by the New York ISO which manages the states transmission grid between and while statewide demand in New York rose by MW generat ing capacity under contract in the state reportedly increased only by MW Consequently given all of these factors power supplies in New York remain ed strained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of n ew generation capacity However Astoria Energy which seeks to bring new g eneration online in New York that will be based on clean technologies may still face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the c onstruction of any new plants in the region with the exception of peaker u nits whose output would be closely regimented If plans for this plant ar e blocked or significantly altered following the experience of Sithe Energ ies the options to resolve New York Citys supply demand imbalance will once again become focused on a combination of other approaches including c onservation efforts and reliance on distributed generation alternatives An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We

IATESTCornerBLjpg escientechcomIATESTCornerBRjpg November FERC Enacts Major Constraints on Wholesale Market By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis AEP Entergy Corp and Southern Company told by FERC to charge costbased p rices instead of marketbased prices for wholesale spot transactions News item from Reuters The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FER C voted last week to adopt new rules to measure market power as a con dition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade powe r in the wholesale market FERC commissioners said the new test would impro ve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market last winter when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight supplies FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base d on supply margin assessments which examines a companys importance in se rving peak electricity loads If youre big enough to control the market a t the time we look at it youll have mitigation put on you said FERC Cha irman Pat Wood Analysis Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry are still reeling from FERCs new ruling which may have slipped past some radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday weekend This is a mammoth ruling on FERCs part however and it holds tre mendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lions share of their profits coming from wholesale transactions In addition state reg ulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin king profits in their wholesale operations While FERC has presented this r uling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience d in the California market the new limits on wholesale transactions can al so be seen as another example of the big stick that the commission is usi ng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat ions RTO Further the ruling is another striking indication that Chairma n Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m arkets while still attempting to support competition The objective represe nts a tall order and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom pt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading Put into a nutshell FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charg e unregulated marketbased rates for spot market wholesale transactions I nstead companies identified as having market power and that arent part of an approved RTO must charge costbased prices for power that isnt committ ed in a longterm contract and publicly disclose those costbased prices Columbus Ohiobased American Electric Power NYSE AEP Atlantabased Sou thern Company NYSE SO and New Orleansbased Entergy Corp NYSE ETR ha ve been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately apply ing its new standards for wholesale transactions Note that Mirant Corp a former subsidiary of Southern Company has also been identified as having to submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power s eparate from its former parent The commission has essentially determined t hat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the areas in which they operate Under FERCs new market power test a gener ator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici ty is pivotal during peak demand which enables the company to demand a p rice above competitive levels Regional transmission constraints will also be considered now as a measurement of a companys market power This is a d ramatic departure from previous standards by which under one of FERCs ma in criterions a company that supplied less than percent of the power ne eded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l evel There are some important exceptions to the ruling First FERC has not elim inated the utilities ability to charge marketbased rates in areas where t he grid and markets are controlled by a FERCapproved RTO This is signific ant as I will expand upon subsequently because it indicates that there ar e secondary objectives in FERCs new ruling In addition the current rulin g only impacts shortterm sales transactions in which these three utilities are involved In other words longterm contracts that the three companies may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im pacted by the ruling However the three companies named in the ruling will have to post pricing information related to longterm contracts and FERC has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for longterm co ntracts may be necessary Also note that the Western market which already is under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June was not inclu ded in the new ruling The three utilities named in the ruling now have days to submit proposal s to FERC outlining a transition to charging costbased wholesale rates for all power not currently committed to a buyer Specifically the utilities will have to post on their openaccess sametime information systems OASIS the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour in a hour period Moving forward the price that the utilities can charg e for noncommitted power on the spot market will be the difference between their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region that their power displaces The new costbased rates must be administered by an independent third party The new pricing standards revert back to an older costbased technique kno wn as split the savings The methodology for this standard can get rather complicated but essentially under FERCs new ruling the three companies i dentified will have to post their costbased incremental costs for spot po wer into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases Purchasers wh o want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci ng or buying the power on their own The final price for the transactions w ill be the split between the sellers incremental cost and the buyers decr emental bid For instance if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at MWh the transact ion price would be MWh Assuming a midnighttomidnight trading day se llers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da y and buyers would submit their decremental bids by pm What this potent ially creates is an information advantage for buyers who have six hours t o evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers Some of t he drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th e purchaser to game the system by having access to the sellers original in cremental bid and competing around the sellers price Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section of the Federal Power Act to apply the new marketbasedsales policy to all US sellers nationwide What this means i s that although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it b elieves to be erratic wholesale markets Reportedly some companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes th ey exert market power The investigation reportedly also requires power providers with marketbased sales authority to amend their tariffs within days to provide FERC with openended authority to order refunds if the c ommission determines that market manipulation has occurred I made a previous reference to the big stick that FERC is carrying relate d to participation in RTOs Remember that a few months ago Chairman Wood h ad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of charging marketbased wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli cations advantages that the chairman equated with the new world of the d eregulated energy market With this in mind note that only Southern Compan y Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling although it may be s ubsequently expanded Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhi bited some resistance in following FERCs consolidation mandate regarding n ational RTOs so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti lities have been singled out This must be particularly painful for Souther n Company which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an d previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov er the next five years Interestingly Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single diss enting vote in the ruling Breathitts concern was that the ruling had been pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu ate the impact on wholesale markets This issue will undoubtedly be contest ed and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to have been caught offguard AEP Entergy and Southern Company all issued st atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t he ruling would impact them and that they were reserving the right for pos sible litigation Moreover to summarize the commissions rulemaking I think there are a han dful of important points that should be considered First the ruling illus trates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke marketprice authority that was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed his post as chairman Second FERC is implementing costbased prices on the spot market only and in only very defined circumstances However this co uld be an indication that the commission may extend costbased pricing to o ther wholesale transactions including longterm contracts at a later time Third the split the savings costbased formula could become fraught wi th its own problems Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov er power sellers which will now be required to post incremental costs in t he bidding process Finally one of the inherent drivers of FERCs new ruli ng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission has approved It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact s AEP Entergy and Southern Company utilities that have not only been deem ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a lso not yet joined an approved RTO However even though only three compani es are immediately impacted by this ruling it should not be overlooked tha t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain areas Thus overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power market are conducted An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We
