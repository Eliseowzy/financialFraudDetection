Davis Hayslett Rod Saunders James Howard Kevin A Cc Ratner Michael Subject RE TW model I thought we were using the average rates for resubscription with an adjustment for fuel because the historical rates assumed a over collection Original Message From Thames Davis Sent Monday February AM To Hayslett Rod Saunders James Geaccone Tracy Howard Kevin A Cc Ratner Michael Subject RE TW model Attached is the model incorporating the changes have implemented undivided interest concept Cash flow detail is as follows a mm in operating cash flow b mm net from release of ENE receivablepayable c mm equity infusion d mm debt repayment e mm in new debt to bring debt to target levels f mm equity dividend to bring equity to target levels Ive used the income detail tab to ratio taxes appropriately Ive made reg amort mm per Bob Regulatory asset remains on books thru Not including interest expense proforma ROE is in the to range Rod debt capital was not invested in a project with returns exceeding cost of debt therefore ROE dropped with leverage Agreed this is backwards from intuitive result Davis File TWmodelrdxls Original Message From Hayslett Rod Sent Monday February AM To Thames Davis Saunders James Cc Geaccone Tracy Howard Kevin A Subject RE TW model See below Jim see Original Message From Thames Davis Sent Monday February AM To Hayslett Rod Howard Kevin A Cc Geaccone Tracy Subject RE TW model Please see comments below We should probably show TransPecos as an undivided ownership interest as opposed to an investment in JV That way the revenues and costs will be picked up above the line and can be analyzed with the other revenues Looks like we are properly picking up the capex from TransPecos in our capex additions already I might be missing something but I only see two accounting ways to handle TransPecos equity method investment as shown or consolidated with minority interests In the former case our debt holdings are understated and in the latter theyre overstated My guess is that the JV will be accounted for as shown In terms of capex currently I have TW picking up of the capex starting equity basis Not to be flip but Im not sure which accounting method would let us pick up half the revenues and half the costs If we had an undivided interest we would have of the deal on our books debt and all Please let me know which method I should use The equity balance did not seem to change for the equity infusion Was this treated as equity in to repay or just an extinguishment There was mm in excess cash that was dividended back out The model had to increase borrowings and pay a dividend to get the debtequity ratio to after the infusion It would seem to me that if there was coming in that it needed to be paid to reduce the corresponding debt so where did the excess cash come from Lets grow Other Taxes by Should grow by the same percentage as either revenues or net plant For most pipes these are propertyearnings dependent and are derived from the uitlity operating income line on the form for the most part I need to fix the model to make other taxes a function of ppe Ill make it a constant rate based on year Rod reminds me that part of that is probably gross receipts Ill go back to the planning models and try to figure out a relative proportion Also a part is payroll taxes Tracy could probably break it apart for you Question for TG Reg Am was only million in but million going forward All Reg Am should disappear with the new rate case thats why we had to increase it so much so that it amortizes to zero by Note that it is noncash nontax but it represents a large reduction in equity Then there must be a problem elsewhere since it is supposed to be gone by itself Question for LDSH on the drop in revenues by approx million Detail schedules show why just want to make sure it makes sense Thats an item that Lindys following up on but probably the whole group needs to consider Our fuel retention goes away after the question is whether max rates should add in the revenues that we derived from fuel retention or not The interpretation in the model is that max rates means our max published reservation fee only meaning that we lose mm of fuel retention after If we are at max rates then that would be the result however if we are at average rates we would be able to get it back up to the max rate number ROE questionscases Lets show after ROE the ROE without the effect of the additional debt that was added in Nov This obviously dropped the ROE from to If Cooper is successfully in coming out with no debt on TW it should not have been there in the first place the ROE will be much higher In addition reducing equity by the should also improve the ROE substantially Ill run a line that adds back taxadjusted interest expense in the ROE calc the mm was handled as above This is not intuitive The ROE should be bigger with debt unless the ROE is less than the cost of debt Debt up equity down ROE up

take my sons hamster to the vet Heres what happened Just after dinner one night my son came up to tell me there was something wrong with one of the two hamsters he holds prisoner in his room Hes just lying there looking sick he told me Oldest trick in the book son I informed him You go in to see whats wrong with the sick one and the other one sneaks up behind you and bonks you on the head Then they change into your clothes and escape Im serious Dad Can you help I put my best hamsterhealer expression on my face and followed him into his bedroom One of the little rodents was indeed lying on his back looking distressed I immediately knew what to do Call the professional Honey I called come look at the hamster Oh my gosh my wife diagnosed after a minute Shes having babies What my son demanded But their names are Bert and Ernie Mom I was equally outraged Hey how can that be I thought we said we didnt want them to reproduce I accused my wife Well what did you want me to do post a sign in their cage she inquired I actually think she said this sarcastically No but you were supposed to get two boys I reminded her in my most loving calm sweet voice Yeah Bert and Ernie my son agreed Well its just a little hard to tell on some guys she informed me Again with the sarcasm you think By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on I shrugged deciding to make the best of it Kids this is going to be a wondrous experience I announced Were about to witness the miracle of birth OH Gross they shrieked Well isnt THAT just Great what are we going to do with a litter of tiny little hamster babies my wife wanted to know I really do think she was being snotty here too Dont you Well when my parents dogs had puppies I took them up to the grocery store in a cardboard box and gave them away I recalled So what are you going to do go up with a pair of tweezers so people can pick out their hamster she asked Gotta love her We peered at the patient After much struggling what looked like a tiny foot would appear briefly vanishing a scant second later We dont appear to be making much progress I noted A breech birth my wife whispered horrified Do something Dad my son urged Okay okay Squeamishly I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next appeared giving it a gingerly tug It disappeared I tried again with the same results Should I dial my eldest daughter wanted to know Maybe they could talk us through the trauma You see a pattern here with my females Lets get Ernie to the vet I said grimly We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in his lap Breathe Ernie breathe he urged I dont think hamsters do Lamaze his mother noted to him Women can be so cruel to their own young I mean what she does to me is one thing but this boy is of her womb for Gods sake The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the little animal through a magnifying glass What do you think Doc an epidermal I suggested scientifically Oh very interesting he murmured Mr and Mrs Cameron may I speak to you privately for a moment I gulped nodding for my son to step outside Is Ernie going to be okay my wife asked Oh perfectly the vet assured us This hamster is not in labor In fact that isnt EVER going to happen Ernie is a boy What You see Ernie is a young male And occasionally as they come into maturity male hamsters will master er er ah He blushed glancing at my wife Well you know what Im saying Mr Cameron We were silent absorbing this So Ernies just just Excited my wife offered Exactly the vet replied relieved that we understood More silence Then my lovely wife started to giggle And giggle And then even laugh loudly Whats so funny I demanded knowing but not believing that the woman I married would commit the upcoming affront to my flawless Manliness Tears were now running down her face Just that Im picturing you pulling on its its teeny little she gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more Thats enough I warned We thanked the Veterinarian and hurriedly bundled the hamsters and our son back into the car He was glad everything was goingto be okay I know Ernies really thankful for what youve done Dad he told me Oh you have NO idea my wife agreed collapsing into laughter as I gave her a dirty look

mapped out a strategy in each of these areas set deliverables and ex pect to accomplish a lot while our BU reps are with us from Feb th to th Data Warehouse Project Update The cost reporting pilot has been built by Beverly Fennessy and the technic al team based on the design Li Chan has specified based on your input from the initial interviews followups and several cost reporting workshops she has sponsored in the last month The pilot will be a minicost reporting button using a small subset of act ual financial data from SAPCO one BU three months of data and showing only the cost center information not project info It is designed to tes t this solutions ActaOracleBusiness Objects ability to extract data from SAP using Acta report data using a team structure develop usable presentable and technically efficient canned reports and provide users an adhoc query tool for reporting and analysis not cove red by canned reports The BU reps need to become familiar with the pilot and all of our intervie w participants are invited to see the pilot and evaluate the tool Well have a questionnaire for your comments and suggestions which we will incorporate into the development of the actual cost reporting button The res a distribution list at the end of this memo if you know of someone i n your group who should attend please invite them Assuming no significant changes are identified in the user review of the p ilot we expect at least a portion of the cost reporting from the data ware house to be rolled into production by the end of April So be sure to voic e your input The second part of the warehouse will be cash reporting Steve Frazier is the BU rep leading this effort with Mike Deville from Corp Reporting and S usan Bellinghausen from the ISC providing input We are working on both di rect and indirect cash flow historical and trying to determine the best w ay to source the data Wed like to get it from SAP since thats where we can get the most detail with the Treasury workstation as the source for ma nual wires not yet input into SAP However Susans group has told us that the current SAP design wont allow us to use the Cash Budget Management mo dule since that information doesnt tie to FI due to differences in value date and posting date Therefore were looking at what SAP design change s might be needed The next step will be earnings which will expand cost reporting by bringin g in gross margin other income interest expense minority interest and ta xes Were hoping to be able to tie into the Energy Ops Project Enlighten data warehouse as a source of gross margin data for wholesale operations We envision that the counterparty reporting button will also interface with other Enron warehousing efforts such as Global Counterparty A significant objective of the warehouse is to provide ad hoc reporting so we will be looking at the data behind the reporting buttons and determinin g which other information should be transferred into the warehouse in the e arly phases Our strategy is to place only the information that is most re quested into the warehouse in the early phases but to design the warehouse to be flexible enough to allow additional fields to be transferred in over time Budgeting and Forecasting Tool In our interviews many people expressed an interest in an automated planni ng tool We have looked at three products SAPs SEM Hyperions Planning and Adaytums ePlanning Some of you attended a demo of Adaytum last week We like because it seems to have the most functionality and two Enron BUs already use it Europe and EBS We want to be able to plan for earnings as well as cash forecasting and projected balance sheets with these number s feeding the warehouse so that our reporting could include both actuals an d plan or forecast Wed like to hear any thoughts you have on how you thi nk your BU would use a tool such as this Were evaluating the valuation proposition now and expect to can make a rec ommendation at Ricks February staff meeting Susan Helton and James Weitekamp are working on this effort Close Process Howard Selzer is leading the initiative to shorten the close process He i s gathering close calendars from each BU and is talking with each group abo ut possible opportunities to squeeze time out of the schedule He will als o focus on topside entries after the th workday to determine how to elim inate the need for these entries Glenn Kobes will provide the tax perspec tive Knowledge Sharing Joe Darensbourg is preparing a plan to share best practices among groups He is also spearheading the Global Accounting Intranet site which is one o f the media we can use A Web Advisory Team has been formed so that each B U will have input into how we can best communicate using this site still w aiting for ETS and Europe to appoint representatives to this team Ideas for knowledge sharing include soliciting tips to be reviewed by the Web Adv isory Team and then posted to the intranet site forming user groups in coo peration with the ISC ETS has groups already in place setting up a forum to ask questions of other users either as part of eThink or separately a nd encouraging participation in the Houston ASUG SAP user group Well w ant to coordinate with the ISCs efforts to avoid duplication they have FA Qs on their web site Alternate Hierarchies Caroline Lothian is working to compare and document how the each BU uses al ternate hierarchies for reporting This specifically addresses team reporti ng but also includes anything other than the legal rollup A common desig n for team report hierarchies is necessary to build canned reports in the d ata warehouse since we expect you will want to include data at drilldown levels such as BU line of business team profit center and cost center B eyond a team hierarchy were really looking to share best practices rather than build a common standard Number of Entities and Cost Objects Currently we have about legal or accounting entities and nearly cost objects in SAP As far as we know this is the largest number amon g all of SAPs customers We want to be proactive in controlling these num bers before they have the possibility of bringing our systems to their knee s In addition the large number of entities and cost objects result in ex tra costs related to tax compliance and accounting maintenance as well as the intangible costs related to higher complexity Jill Erwin is heading a n initiative to first find out how the BUs use various cost objects and whe ther there may be a way to simplify their use and then to identify ways to ensure that new entities and cost objects are set up only when that is the best way to accomplish Enrons objectives Training and Change Management In our interviews we heard about some problems that may be able to be reso lved through specific training We will also need training on the new tool s and initiatives that will be implemented in Project Sunrise It is also important for us to continue to communicate with various accounting groups as to what Project Sunrise is doing so that we can ensure that we provide w hat users really need Madeline Chan and Dave McEllin are taking the lead on what approach we should take on training We have also spoken with the Change Management team in the ISC under Andy Lawrence who has agreed to provide direction and resources as well as help ensure that together we are providing seamless service to our users Other Issues Other areas that we intend to address in Project Sunrise include the automa tion of buckets and eschedules balance sheets by profit center intercomp any issues and foreign currency issues In addition we working with Susan Bellinghausen and Rick Boehm ISC to provide better reporting related to payroll distribution and labor distribution As you can see this is a very broad project and we want to be sure each B U is properly represented If youd like to offer additional resources to Sunrise either in general or related to a specific initiative please call Mark at x or Jan at x Attached is the mailing list

Award Its an annual honor given to the person who provided the Universal human gene pool the biggest service by getting killed in the most extraordinarily stupid way As always competition this year has been keen again Some candidates appear to have trained their whole lives for this event DARWIN AWARD CANDIDATES In September in Detroit a yearold man got stuck and drowned in two feet of water after squeezing head first through an inchwide sewer grate to retrieve his car keys In October a yearold San Francisco stockbroker who totally zoned when he ran according to his wife accidentally jogged off a foothigh cliff on his daily run Buxton NC A man died on a beach when an footdeep hole he had dug into the sand caved in as he sat inside it Beach goers said Daniel Jones dug the hole for fun or protection from the wind and had been sitting in a beach chair at the bottom Thursday afternoon when it collapsed burying him beneath feet of sand People on the beach on the outer banks used their hands and shovels trying to claw their way to Jones a resident of Woodbridge VA but could not reach him It took rescue workers using heavy equipment almost an hour to free him while about people looked on Jones was pronounced dead at a hospital In February Santiago Alvarado was killed in Lompoc CA as he fell facefirst through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he was burglarizing Death was caused when the long flashlight he had placed in his mouth to keep his hands free rammed into the base of his skull as he hit the floor According to police in Dahlonega GA ROTC cadet Nick Berrena was stabbed to death in January by fellow cadet Jeffrey Hoffman who was trying to prove that a knife could not penetrate the flak vest Berrena was earing Sylvester Bridal JR was killed in February in Selbyville Del as he won a bet with friends who said he would not put a revolver loaded with four bullets into his mouth and pull the trigger In February according to police in Windsor Ontario Daniel Kolta and Randy Taylor died in a headon collision thus earning a tie in the game of chicken they were playing with their snowmobiles DARWIN AWARD HONORABLE MENTIONS In Guthrie Okla in October Jason Heck tried to kill a millipede with a shot from his caliber rifle but the bullet ricocheted off of a rock near the hole and hit pal Antonio Martinez in the head fracturing his skull In Elyria Ohio in October Marty Eskins attempting to clean out cobwebs in his basement declined to use a broom in favor of a propane torch and caused a fire that burned the first and second floors of his house Paul Stiller was hospitalized in Andover Township NJ in September and his wife Bonnie was also injured by a quarterstick of dynamite that blew up in their car While driving around at AM the bored couple lit the dynamite and tried to toss it out the window to see what would happen but they apparently failed to notice that the window was closed TACOMA WA Kerry Bingham had been drinking with several friends when one of them said they knew a person who had bungeejumped from the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in the middle of traffic The conversation grew more heated and at least men trooped along the walkway of the bridge at am Upon arrival at the midpoint of the bridge they discovered that no one had brought a bungee rope Bingham who had continued drinking volunteered and pointed out that a coil of linemans cable lay nearby One end of the cable was secured around Binghams leg and the other end was tied to the bridge His fall lasted feet before the cable tightened and tore his foot off at the ankle He miraculously survived his fall into the icy river water and was rescued by two nearby fishermen All I can say said Bingham is that God was watching out for me on that night Theres just no other explanation for it Binghams foot was never located AND NOW FOR THE WINNER PADERBORN GERMANY Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt fed his constipated elephant Stefan doses of animal laxative and more than a bushel of berries figs and prunes before the plugged up pachyderm finally let fly and suffocated the keeper under pounds of poop Investigators say illfated Friedrich was attempting to give the ailing elephant an olive oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on him like a dump truck full of mud The sheer force of the elephants unexpected defecation knocked Mr Riesfeldt to the ground where he struck his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued to evacuate his bowels on top of him said flabbergasted Paderborn police detective Erik Dern With no one there to help him he lay under all that dung for at least an hour before a watchman came along and during that time he suffocated It seems to be just one of those freak accidents that happen
