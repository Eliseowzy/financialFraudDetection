situation persists the more money Enron will lose Please note the following when planning our legal strategy Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL an English incorporated company is our company which has entered into physical electricty sales contracts to supply certain Dutch Distribution Companies The physical supply contracts are governed by Dutch law and are subject either to ICC arbitration in either Paris Rotterdam or the Hague or the NAI in Rotterdam or the Hague dependant upon the counterparty ECTRL is also a Participant on the APX Enron Capital Trade Resources International Corp ECTRIC a company incorporated in Delaware US is the Enron entity which as principal enters into financial swaps arranged through Enron Europe Finance Trading Limted EEFT an English incorporated company which is regulated by the SFA with among others Dutch Distribution companies The swap contracts have all been dicumented on a Deemed ISDA basis representative confirms have already been sent to you on this aspect Query What actions do we have against TennetT re allocation of capacity by TenneT for Yr in November Allocation of capacity by TenneT to SEP first step in allocation which defined market quota Misapplication of rest of capacity ie MW by TenneT to other Market parties eg Enron allocation favoured incumbents based on market share General unreasonable behaviour lack of good faith of TenneT Misleading market with early rules addition of extra unfounded rules post Nov in reasonable knowledge that market parties had already acted on earlier information from TenneT Jan closing Dutch market to imports query whether this was also for the UCTE system support activities suspect not in an unreasonable fashion ie changed procedures when it had no need so to do The normal procedures whereby TenneT curtailed in the event of a problem on the day would have been sufficient to maintain system stability Disingenous allocation of MW in offpeak capacity night at the same time as indicating to the market that no more than or MW was expected by TenneT to be available for use due to Seps plant despatch regime Reasonable action would have been to allocate no more than the MW to Sep and the market on a term basis with any additional capacity available on a given day treated as uncertain spot capacity and allocated to the APX Lack of checking andor other disingenuity re failure properly to check Sep take or pay obligations Lack of transparency of information eg French grid problems result in cut of MW available to APX No assistance from TenneT either to provide guidance as to the real extent or duration of the problem or to take reasonable steps to mitigate the problem by eg cooperating with market parties aiming to put in place offsetting transit arrangements to alleviate the congestion PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ALREADY SUBJECT TO AN EXISTING NMA COMPLAINT COMMENCED THROUGH LOEFF CLAEYS IN DEC Query as a first stage what injunctive andor other relief can we bring against TenneT for unlawful allocation to Sep re non take or pay element In our view this would provide some immediate commercial relief to Enron Evidence Herkstroter report implied despatch regime implied general market consensus electricity plans DTE consultation paper on transmission reference to virtual power plants EZDTE advice which limited reservation to take or pay hence only needed if some parts were non take or pay Current despatch levels on term deals imply Sep taking MW Query method of putting all of this in evidence discovery etc Resolution required Deny Sep right to use TenneT capacity for nontake or pay elements nb relevant take or pay is energy component ie obligation to import at border cf take or pay on virtual capacity Release capacity to APX in accordance with existing use it or lose it principle or TenneT to allocate to term market under weekly contract category established by DTE Damages against TenneT Query

once granted capacity by TenneT blocking of essential facilities ie generation to other parties Plant despatch see below re collusive behaviour Protocol Sep refusing to contemplate changes to superpeak charges which in no way bear reasonable relation to supplydemand or electricity production costs Query availability to Enron of injunctive andor other relief against Sep for a unlawful

Query method of putting all of this in evidence discovery etc Query Actions against the APX For failing to enforce the APX Rules on ensuring firm crossborder capacity prebid Query availability and speed of injunction under Dutch law against APX Query ability of Enron to claim damages against APX for losses suffered owing to failure of APX to enforce its Rules Note failure of APX to enforce its Rules causes losses both to a ECTRL on its physical sales onto APX from Germany and Belgium by virtue of other parties preventing legitimate level of sales by ECTRL by breaching APX rules Art etc b ECTRL on its physical supply contracts as prices on the APX are artificially higher than contracted supply price plus c ECTRIC on swaps ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX causing artificially high prices hence securing more profit out of the swaps Query Actions against APX Participants for manipulating the APX DAM causing

Ability of Dutch counterparties to swaps to speculate rather than hedge by way of OTC Derivatives and any good faithintegrity issues re parties use of speculative cf hedging swaps combined with deliberate and systematic market manipulation by swap counterparts Query what action can we take against APX Participants i to prevent them further manipulating APX and ii claiming our losses against them on both ECTRLs physical supply contracts and ECTRICs swaps In particular Query availability of injunction against APX Participants to prevent them from manipulating APX DAM Query availability of legitimate nonperformance by ECTRIC of swaps and legitimate nonperformance of physical supply contracts by ECTRL or reliance on liability caps Query availability of preemptive damages or other forms of actions against swap counterparties Query best jurisdiction esp re swaps English Dutch US Note need to obtain from a strategic perspective best jurisdictions and best course and causes of action on a preemptivebasis as far as possible to avoid claims of forum shopping and bring maximum pressure plus advice needed on whether we should take preemptive action or to defend and or counterclaim if we get sued if we do not perform on swaps or physical contracts Query standard and nature of evidence we need to prove manipulation query availability of discovery re such conduct in the various pertinent jurisdictions Query Actions available to Enron against Parties for collusive behaviour Supply market actions Deliberate and systematic attempts by certain parties predominantly large Dutch

manipulating the APX causing artificially high prices hence securing more profit out of the swaps Issue Query availability of shareholder action by ECTRL in concert with others as shareholders of the Exchange against APX for mismanagement in failing to enforce APX Rules leading to a damage to certain Participants and or b damage to APXs prospects as a main European power exchange Resolution required Tactics APX has published certain crossborder transmission contract audit requirements which are to come into effect on copy will faxed shortly we query effectiveness of this compromise approach plus there isnothing specific mentioned re other manipulative conduct eg crossing Hence Issue above required to be done as if APX measures fail then we may need to file suit quickly to bring matters to a head IMPORTANT Irrespective of whether or not APX audit prevents manipulation etc need to consider taking appropriate actions againstAPX or others in any event asap in order to flush out evidence re manipulation conspiracy among certain Participants re any defence counterclaims to any nonpayment on swaps etc see below Query benefit at this stage of shareholder letter to APX setting scene for mismanagement corporate action Points to note Timeline needed of when to commence length of time to get to Court etc plus re above best methodology of gathering sufficient evidence in due time for defence counterclaims on swap issues see below IMMEDIATE PRIORITY Query Do we have any legitimate grounds for nonperforming on our swap contracts physical contracts and what should be our strategy re this eg preemptive actions or defensive actions counterclaims Note certain counterparties to contracts with Enron are causing loss to Enron by what we believe is market manipulation of APX collusion to lockup market etc Certain other parties to such contracts with Enron we do not believe are party to such conduct Losses to Enron are however occurring as follows a to ECTRL on its physical sales onto APX from Germany and Belgium by virtue of other parties preventing legitimate level of sales by ECTRL by breaching APX rules Art etc b to ECTRL on its physical supply contracts as prices on the APX are artificially higher than contracted supply price plus c ECTRIC on swaps ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX causing artificially high prices hence securing more profit out of the swaps Issue Can ECTRIC legitimately withhold payments on the swaps Query availability of preemptive damages or other forms of actions against swap counterparties Query best jurisdiction esp re swaps English Dutch US Resolution needed need to obtain from a strategic perspective best jurisdictions and best course and causes of action on a preemptivebasis as far as possible to avoid claims of forum shopping and bring maximum pressure plus advice needed on whether we should take preemptive action or to defend and or counterclaim if we get sued if we do not perform on swaps or physical contracts Initial Clifford Chance view None no suitable preemptive action available to Enron defences counterclaims only All proceedings likely to be in England and subject to contracts governing law English under Art Brussels convention Dutch conflict of laws principles Highly unlikley that any US action by Enron practically possible US courts will consider forum shopping unless can show that Dutch counterparty has minimum contacts in the US means in detail even then US courts unlikely to give any appropriate relief query enforcement problems in any event Clifford Chances initial gut reaction is to withhold payment wait for counterparty to sue which would probably be by way of summary judgement approx months to get court in England If so to defeat summary proceedings thus delaying matters to full trial ECTRIC would then need to establish prima facie case for either defence on breach of implied term v difficult indeed but gut reaction is that London Commercial Court could be swayed by an argument that actual counterparty has acted in bad faith eg manipulated mkt fairly untested area and or counterclaim for conspiracy to defraud for which need to establish prima facie case of conspiracy between counterparty and others to rig the mkt etc Notes Need to thoroughly investigate all options here approx of losses could be on the swaps Need to consider evidence re mkt rigging conspiracy to defraud practically whether this could effectively be brough to light by any actions against APX see Issue of Point APX above the race between timescales of summary judgment in England versus any actions against APX under Dutch law to flush out evidence Any additional ways of securing appropriate evidence to the relevant standard of proof whether through crt actions or otherwise whether in the UK US or in the Netherlands and timescales Eg availability of putting people on the Witness Stand in the Netherlands Queries re Clifford Chance initial view a Repercussions action by counterparty not by way of summary judgment but by way of filing insolvency petition under Section IA b Any views altered re amenability of commercial crt if i Enron knew last year that APX could be manipulated if Enron itself had enterd into similar but smallerscale manipulation for short period last year Check Ability of Dutch counterparties to swaps to speculate rather than hedge by way of OTC Derivatives and any good faithintegrity issues re parties use of speculative cf hedging swaps combined with deliberate and systematic market manipulation by swap counterparts Query Any SFA repercussions for EEFT Issue Liability of ECTRL under physical supply contracts Does liability cap on physical contracts work if ECTRL fails intentionally to deliver Does consequential losses exclusion on phyiscal contracts work if ECTRL fails to deliver Strategy ie should we fail to deliver pay undisputed amount of bill and dispute rest of bill and let counterparty take us to arbitration OR can this have any adverse repercussions re any other opart of our legal strategy SECONDARY PRIORITY Query What actions do we have against TenneT to recoup our losses re allocation of capacity by TenneT for Yr in November Issue Misapplication in law of capacity ie MW by TenneT to Market parties eg Enron after Sep allocation allocation favoured incumbents based on market share this caused a new entrant such as Enron loss Issue General unreasonable behaviour lack of good faith of TenneT Misleading market with early rules addition of extra unfounded rules post Nov in reasonable knowledge that market parties had already acted on earlier information from TenneT Jan closing Dutch market to imports query whether this was also for the UCTE system support activities suspect not in an unreasonable fashion ie changed procedures when it had no need so to do The normal procedures whereby TenneT curtailed in the event of a problem on the day would have been sufficient to maintain system stability Disingenous allocation of MW in offpeak capacity night at the same time as indicating to the market that no more than or MW was expected by TenneT to be available for use due to Seps plant despatch regime Reasonable action would have been to allocate no more than the MW to Sep and the market on a term basis with any additional capacity available on a given day treated as uncertain spot capacity and allocated to the APX Lack of checking andor other disingenuity re failure properly to check Sep take or pay obligations Lack of transparency of information eg French grid problems result in cut of MW available to APX No assistance from TenneT either to provide guidance as to the real extent or duration of the problem or to take reasonable steps to mitigate the problem by eg cooperating with market parties aiming to put in place offsetting transit arrangements to alleviate the congestion PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ALREADY SUBJECT TO THE SAME EXISTING NMA COMPLAINT ON COMPETION GROUNDS REFERRED TO IN ABOVE COMMENCED THROUGH LOEFF CLAEYS IN DEC Resolution required Damages against TenneT Evidence Herkstroter report implied despatch regime implied general market consensus electricity plans DTE consultation paper on transmission reference to virtual power plants EZDTE advice which limited reservation to take or pay hence only needed if some parts were non take or pay Current despatch levels on term deals imply Sep taking MW Sep newspaper quotes intent to use MW day and night intended block on capacity and refusal to contemplate change to superpeak pricing Query method of putting all of this in evidence discovery etc SECONDARY PRIORITY Query ability of Enron to claim damages against APX for losses suffered owing to failure of APX to enforce its Rules and to allow gaming etc Note failure of APX to enforce have enforced its Rules causes losses both to a ECTRL on its physical sales onto APX from Germany and Belgium by virtue of other parties preventing legitimate level of sales by ECTRL by breaching APX rules Art etc b ECTRL on its physical supply contracts as prices on the APX are artificially higher than contracted supply price plus c ECTRIC on swaps ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX causing artificially high prices hence securing more profit out of the swaps Resolution required Damages against the APX SECONDARY PRIORITY Query Actions against APX Participants for manipulating the APX DAM causing losses to Enron Note manipulation of APX DAM by certain Participants causes losses both to a ECTRL on its physical sales onto APX from Germany and Belgium by virtue of others parties preventing legitimate level of sales by ECTRL by breaching APX rules Art etc b ECTRL on its physical supply contracts as prices on the APX are artificially higher than contracted supply price plus c ECTRIC on swaps ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX causing artificially high prices hence securing more profit out of the swaps Resolution required What action can we take against APX Participants i to prevent them further manipulating APX and ii claiming our losses against them on both ECTRLs physical supply contracts and ECTRICs swaps In particular Query availability of injunction summary proceedings against APX Participants to prevent them from manipulating APX DAM SECONDARY PRIORITY Query Actions against SEP a Plant despatch see below re collusive behaviour b Protocol Sep refusing to contemplate changes to superpeak charges which in no way bear reasonable relation to supplydemand or electricity production costs Query availability to Enron of injunctive andor other relief against Sep for a unlawful application and retention eg query damages action against Sep and or b nature plant despatch and or c conduct re Protocol Evidence Herkstroter report implied despatch regime implied general market consensus electricity plans DTE consultation paper on transmission reference to virtual power plants EZDTE advice which limited reservation to take or pay hence only needed if some parts were non take or pay Current despatch levels on term deals imply Sep taking MW Sep newspaper quotes intent to use MW day and night intended block on capacity and refusal to contemplate change to superpeak pricing Query method of putting all of this in evidence discovery etc Query Actions available to Enron against Parties for collusive behaviour Supply market actions Deliberate and systematic attempts by certain parties predominantly large Dutch distcos to deny new entrants ability to access capacityenergy at reaonable prices by virtue of a withholding capacity within NL ie Protocol and b breaching APX rules gaming in such a fashion as to block legitimate access for those parties with foreign txn to sell legitimate volumes on APX consistent with APX rules Effect of withholding capacity from market compounded by collusive actions to manipulate APX prices by strategic bidding Protocol Collusive behaviour suspected by Dutch Distcos re locking parties out of recontracting and use of Protocol to disadvantage of new market entrants eg see EnergieNed letter now in public domain note transcript of Wed Arnhem Court case on Protocol re intent of parties to keep market short APX Art APX DAM Regs collusion by certain APX Participants suspected re rigging APX prices Art APX DAM Regs collusion suspected by certain APX Participants re failing to ensure that parties have firm crossborder capacity prior to making bids on to APX SepTenneT Import allocation collusion to fudge take or pay issue Plant despatch by Sep collusion to ensure that Sep can despatch plants in such a fashion as to minimise possible imports Note burden and standard of proof of collusive behaviour and ability and means to obtain discovery of such behaviour Some evidence exists from ENECO court case transcript of Arnhem case public plus EnergieNed letter pls taped APX participants meeting of Jan public or accessible to Enron as participant
