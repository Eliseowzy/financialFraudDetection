technology holding unless of course the fundamentals deteriorate will they briefings take from a bit ago Nov ET EMC Corp EMC A forward pe of x is not scaring Bank of America Securities from initiating coverage of the king of storage infrastructure with a Strong Buy and a month price target The analyst views EMC as a core holding for technology investors and believes storage is an essential component of Internet infrastructure Also Bank of America believes EMC is one of five pillars of technology joining Microsoft Intel Cisco and SunEMCs two goals are while EMC dominates the storage area network SAN arena they are looking to penetrate the network attached storage NAS space and increase software to reach of sales Entering the NAS field is a cause for concern for investors of players in that space particularly Network Appliance NTAP the NAS leader EMCs management believes the company will be the leader in the NAS market in The company believes that the upcoming launch of its new midmarket appliance will go a long way towards achieving this goal This midrange NAS product codenamed Chameleon could be a drag on the shares of NTAP when unveiled While EMC has a long way to go before outstaging NTAP in the NAS space this launch will be a precursor of additional competition which would pressure margins Network Appliance recently warned of slowing sequential growth rates On the software front EMCs recent purchase of CrosStor is the latest of several software acquisitions in its effort to boost software sales to The industry is realizing that software is one of the key features that separates a milliondollar EMC storage system from a few dozen hard disks EMC uses software to fend off increasing competition from IBM Sun Microsystems and others However the CrosStor acquisition is a help to both of EMCs goal as its software is primarily used in the NAS marketEMC is unique in that it provides an endtoend storage infrastructure portfolio consisting of storage systems both SAN and NAS software networking and service and support We believe the company has tremendous upside but at such a high multiple we would be wary of entering the stock at these levels Robert J Reid Briefingcom the key point briefing seems to make is that the fundamental story is intact and that management is moving in agro fashion to get more revenue streams online one objective number category player in NAS that sounds overly agro which is good regardless of whether they get there by the caveat briefing notes is that valuation issues need to be worked out this note was penned with the stock at it is now at so these issues do seem to be working themselves out support at and then important to watch interactive of price and volume at these important support points what moves the market next that seems quite clear the tuesday FOMC meeting feeling here is that after this bit of selling dries up the market rallies into the FOMC meeting the selling seems to be on
