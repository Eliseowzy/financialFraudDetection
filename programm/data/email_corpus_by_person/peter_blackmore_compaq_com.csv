Confidential Internal Use Only Worldwide Sales Services team My travel report this month spans the Americas from our operations in Latin America to those in Canada I had many opportunities to visit with our sales and services employees as well as customers partners press and analysts Its really great to have a role that brings me into regular contact with employees and our external audiences its very exciting to see how the momentum is building around the Corporation Latin America has been very successful in its direct and partner initiatives particularly in Argentina where we are now direct and Brazil which has direct business Our LA eBusiness Development team is making tremendous strides to strategically position our business in the fast growing Internet space while opening up new and exciting revenue streams In just four months of existence the team has completed several new alliances with companies investing in the huge growth potential of the Internet in the region Key alliances in this exciting new ecosystem include Diveo a provider of integrated hosting and security services secures Compaqs position as preferred vendor for this potentially huge customer It also allows us to offer critical enabling services that will accelerate the adoption of the Internet and many valuable services in the region We entered a strategic alliance agreement with Artikos a joint venture between Commerce One and Banamex the largest bank in Mexico The terms of the alliance permit Compaq to sell the Commerce One solution to the many offline and online companies investing in BB marketplaces It also positions us to participate as strategic partners in new marketplaces being formed by established brickandmortar players Our strategic alliance with Terra a leading regional portal has begun to generate exciting new revenue streams stemming from a customer acquisitiontraffic arrangement using our Presario keyboard buttons In just four months of operation we successfully

<10816000.1075840207150.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,peter.blackmore@compaq.com,2000-09-05 02:19:00,RE Disappointing news Cc I wanted to let you know that I visited Philippe Bibi last Thursday to debrief on this loss and also to listen to a number of other points he raised that could improve the the way we work together Philippe was very helpful and very direct which I appreciate Some of the reasons we lost this bid is that we failed to execute the sales process as I would expect us to This is not typical of the way we should now work and we have made changes to account management and service representation We have made enormous progress as a Corporation over the last twelve months There is a lot of good news in many accounts around the world but there is also no complacency and it concerns me a great deal when we have less than perfect execution I shall be following up with Philippe and the account team to ensure we do a great job in the future Regards Peter Original Message From Capellas Michael D Sent Friday August AM To Cc Blackmore Peter Subject Disappointing news Ken Very shortly after we spoke I was informed that we had lost the Enron HomePC Program This is a great emotional blow to us and I am beyond disappointed We understood that given our recent strong performance against Dell they would do anything to embarrass us in our own backyard We have very strong insight into their intent and knew they would use this aggressively in their PR campaigns However clearly it was our job to win the business on the merits of the individual program and to compete hard for it We believed that we had a creative offer on the table that would create great value for your employees Obviously we did not perform to your expectations Following is the summary of our activities together which was created before we heard the news I pride myself in developing strong executive relationships with our customers and I would welcome the opportunity for us to put our heads together in order to look for ways we can move the relationships between our two companies to a higher level I also think we should discuss the PR positioning As a member of our Board and as a leader in the Houston community this will be news and I am hopeful we can find a creative way to balance it Again I accept it was ours to win in the marketplace but regret it had to come to this I look forward to your call M From our Enron team EBS Product and Service Supply Agreement Compaq will continue to honor the Product and Service Supply Agreement executed on January between EBS and Compaq whereby Compaq agreed to purchase broadband services from EBS on a take or pay basis in proportion to EBS purchase of NT servers and attached storage It is also important to note that we have been actively partnering with EBS on noncontractual areas such as our ongoing technical joint development and marketing efforts around the Windows Streaming Media product I understand that our teams have been working very closely together and with Microsoft to resolve technical issues with Windows Streaming Media and thereby speed EBS market deployment The major issue is that Enron does not support traffic to many of our concentration point so we need to be creative Bottom line we are down to solvable problems with solution activities underway Windows During the last week of May Compaq responded to a request from Enron to support Windows deployments and placed people on site with no defined contract or process due to Enrons requirements At this writing no contract has been signed and the current contract iteration is at number fourteen Apparently the delivery scope has changed several times and there have been a few mistrals Compaq is continuing to provide resources despite the fact that no contract is in place and will work with Enron to ensure a successful completion of the project Power Management Jesse Greene our CFO will act as the contact point for Enron for power management services The issue is we have existing contracts at favorable rates but we will break the log jam HomePC Program For several months Compaq and Enron have been working the solution to bring technology and Internet access into the homes of every Enron employee There have been many creative discussions around hardware and financing to allow Enron to fully subsidize the package provided Compaq Enron and Compaq Financial Services had gotten to a point where the per month cap was going to require the specifications of the hardware to be reduced In recognition of the value of our partnership and our mutual desire for this program to be the premier program in the industry we have increased the specifications of the hardware while taking significant pricing actions and financing rate reductions These actions will actually allow Enron to support better than expected hardware with the extended warranty for per month This will truly be an industryleading program when launched later this fall
