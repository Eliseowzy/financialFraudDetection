PACIFIC EASTERN BWTXINDUSTRIALINFORES Liquefied Natural Gas LNG Receiving Terminals Making Progress Toward Fruition in an Advisory by Industrialinfocom BusinessEnergy Editors HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREJan The following is an advisory by Industrialinfocom Industrial Information Resources Incorporated Houston In an article written on July concerning the future demand for natural gas in North America Industrial Information Resources identified LNG terminals as part of the solution to the supply and demand problem The demand for natural gas is still expected to reach trillion cubic feet per year by the end of the decade leading to a deficit of trillion cubic feet a year over todays production Importing LNG by tanker to a terminal and then regasifying the liquid before introducing it to the pipeline system is a very economical way of obtaining a supply of natural gas Since July of one LNG terminal has been reactivated adding million cubic feet per day to the supply side and bringing the total receiving capacity to billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from three operational LNG terminals Of the operational terminals one is near completion of an expansion and another is planning a further expansion to begin construction in mid A fourth terminal with a capacity of million cubic feet per day on the East Coast is in the process of reactivation After the addition of an barrel insulated LNG storage tank the facility will be ready to receive its first tanker load in the fall of and has further expansion plans to double the size by Since July the total number of planned LNG terminals has increased from to in North America The average capacity of each will be about million cubic feet per day Two will be located in Canada six in the US and in Mexico The actual number moving ahead since July is somewhat different and reduces the number to one in Canada and two in the US Three of the four in Mexico have moved into the permitting stage and two of these are seeking EPC contractors while the third has already selected one These projects run an average of to million apiece and most have multiple phases carrying out to Ed Weatherly Petroleum Terminals Group Manager with Industrial Information Resources stated I believe that at least seven of these terminals will be constructed and therefore introduce billion cubic per day of natural gas into the pipeline grids of Canada Mexico and the US by late LNG has a regasification ratio of at a specific gravity of which will allow the average LNG tanker to carry billion cubic feet of natural gas in a liquid form which is about a day supply for the average LNG terminal being planned I think that there is a growing interest in these capital intensive projects and by the end of we should have a good idea of which of the players will get to market first and supply the natural gas needed in the energy industry There have been ripples in the marketplace as of late but there will still be many electrical plants with natural gas as the primary fuel type coming on line over the next decade Industrialinfocom provides daily news related to the industrial market place including industry alerts and databases for the

PACIFIC EASTERN BWTXINDUSTRIALINFORES Energy Producers Continue Expansion Plans Despite Cautious Market in in an Advisory by Industrialinfocom BusinessEnergy Editors HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREJan The following is an advisory by IndustrialInfocom Industrial Information Resources Inc Houston It seems as though it was just yesterday that the California energy crisis was reaching catastrophic proportions and Governor Davis CA had all but deemed Houston the evil empire of the universe All eyes were on the states with deregulation looming on the horizon and wondering if the next deregulated state would follow in the steps of California State governors and a newly elected Bush Administration were scrambling for answers to prevent a regional crisis from becoming a national nightmare Prior to that Industrial Information Resources had identified over megawatts of new generation either under construction or in various stages of planning and development The solution then was to build more power plants and add new capacity Also in response to the shortfall of energy production the National Energy Policy estimated the need for new power plants to meet future demand Developers responded in kind taking an aggressive approach to meet our new electrical needs by developing and building new power plants at alarming rates Wow What a difference a year makes Due to new capacity milder seasons and a shaky economy lower demand and prices are causing some to question the validity of the national energy crisis No less than seven states have delayed deregulation placing in question the future developments of some new plants Our economy already in recession took a nosedive after the tragic events of Sept further reducing demand primarily from industrial and commercial customers To close out the year we witnessed the demise of the Enron Corporation which could have farreaching effects in the industry As a result many developers are heading into with a more cautious approach to constructing new power plants On Wednesday one of the most aggressive developers in the industry Calpine Corporation NYSECPN San Jose Calif outlined their revised future development program in a conference call hosted by Pete Cartwright chairman CEO president Robert Kelly president of Calpine Finance Charles Clark senior VP corporate controller and other members of Calpines management team Calpine announced plans for completion of twentyseven projects representing MW currently under construction Upon completion of construction of this program Calpine will have a portfolio of MW of the most efficient power plants in the United States by the end of stated Cartwright Plans are to proceed with thirtyfour projects in advanced development accounting for MW of capacity Development of these projects will be completed to a point where they are ready to begin construction and then will be placed in hot standby according to Mr Cartwright We have ordered all these projects be put on hold and no capital spending will take place until we have had opportunities to do a thorough review of each project Calpine had planned to spend about Billion on advanced projects in We intend to keep going with these projects when conditions are right We do not intend to have any significant cancellations Plans are to continue with approximately MW in early development originally scheduled to be completed by In contrast Cartwright says a number of his competitors are cancelling and selling off their projects In his address Mr Cartwright also commented on the status of power markets availability of capital and earnings Our goal as its always been is to grow Calpine to become the largest and most profitable power generator in North America Calpine is certainly not the only power plant developer to announce revised programs for the coming year Companies such as NRG Energy Dynegy and El Paso Merchant Energy have also announced a review of their strategies Research conducted by Industrial Information Resources has identified over MW of cancelled projects since June of including projects by PPL and Mirant While this is a major contrast from the beginning of all we need is a speedy economic recovery a harsh winter and a scorching summer and it could be deja vu all over again according to Britt Burt manager of power market research for Industrial Information Resources

Industrialinfocom Business Editors Energy Writers HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREJan Researched by Industrialinfocom Industrial Information Resources Incorporated Houston Texas Today synthetic fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel are emerging as the renewable fuels of the future New requirements for reformulated gasoline particularly in California mean that the gasoline additive MTBE no longer meets requirements and that its usage may be environmentally hazardous In California the state air quality board is requiring the removal of MTBE from gasoline by December making ethanol a likely substitute Thirteen other states are investigating similar requirements The controversy surrounding MTBE presents new opportunities for the ethanol industry for the future The renewed interest in ethanol has prompted Industrial Information Resources IIR to develop an exclusive Ethanol Production Package esemdethanolpphtm to track the new developments occurring in the industry along with current and future plant production capacities contact information and capital spending data IIR is tracking over billion in capital spending expected to take place over the next three to five years This will more than double the current capacity of todays ethanol production capabilities In the year some billion gallons were produced in the US The market for ethanol is forecasted to grow to more than billion gallons per year by Biodiesel also known as methyl esters is another renewable fuel derived from new and used vegetable oils Recent interests in biodiesel have come about after discovering that when a mixture of biodiesel is blended with standard petroleum diesel fuel sulfur content will be reduced down to acceptable levels In its pure form biodiesel can be used as a fuel source in most combustion engines that accept diesel fuels Further interest could push this product to the commercial market in the future Today biodiesel fuel production is at million gallons per year As demand grows production is projected to reach million gallons or more annually within the next few years A Bioenergy stimulus package currently before Congress is intended to reduce the US dependence on foreign oil by while increasing the use of synthetic fuels by Synthetic fuel producers are anticipating a greater role for ethanol and biodiesel through and beyond It is forecasted that renewable fuels could boost the US

PACIFIC EASTERN BWTXINDUSTRIALINFORES Capital Spending for the Semiconductor Industry Shows Positive Signs Moving Into in an Advisory by Industrialinfocom BusinessEnergy Editors HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREJan An advisory from Industrialinfocom Industrial Information Resources Incorporated Houston Despite worldwide employment losses in the semiconductor industry new economic data may suggest an upturn in the industry during the second quarter of According to the recently released Semiconductor Billings Report produced by the Semiconductor Industry Association SIA and the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International SEMI association November global chip sales increased by Typically fourth quarter sales are normally high inline with the holiday season and though fourth quarter sales may still lag behind historical figures any consecutive rise in semiconductor sales may indicate that a bottom has formed and a recovery may be near Over the next few months consumer demand will dictate whether or not the upswing in sales will continue Currently the two biggest consumers of tech products relative to semiconductors are multinational corporations and telecommunications companies It is estimated that global spending for hardware and software by consumers will reach billion in Any further investments will be dictated by the future state of the economy During most semiconductor manufacturers scaled back production to reduce inventory levels while demand remained weak Many companies announced employee layoffs that will continue through For example one of the largest employment losses came from Motorola The company announced in December yet another layoff of employees By mid total losses for the company will account for over jobs since August NEC announced plans to suspend chip production in Scotland and lay off employees by April of Several domestic production plants of NEC have also been scaled back because of the economic downturn Santa Clara Califbased Applied Materials Inc recently announced that approximately positions at their Silicon Valley fab facility and roughly positions at their Austin campus would be cut Although the list continues employment data always lags behind other indicators These manufacturers are simply reducing costs during a period of uncertainty As the year unfolds semiconductor sales still remain in question Capital spending for the industry is expected to be down Some semiconductor manufacturers may continue to invest in process automations to stay ahead of the competition The next wave of production technology automation will come from the transition to mm silicon wafer production Semiconductor equipment vendors are pushing hard for manufacturers to modernize into new processes This could come soon Industry experts are forecasting a recovery by mid year spurred by consumer confidence If so semiconductor manufacturers may increase capital investments With inflation under control combined with eleven consecutive interest rate cuts that have made borrowing more attractive corporations have the right formula to move forward with automation and technology investments that will drive semiconductor manufacturers to expand Industrialinfocom is a leading provider of information in the industrial markets including the semiconductors industry For industrialinfocom released the

in kind taking an aggressive approach to meet our new electrical needs by developing and building new power plants at alarming rates Wow What a difference a year makes Due to new capacity milder seasons and a shaky economy lower demand and prices are causing some to question the validity of the national energy crisis No less than seven states have delayed deregulation placing in question the future developments of some new plants Our economy already in recession took a nosedive after the tragic events of Sept further reducing demand primarily from industrial and commercial customers To close out the year we witnessed the demise of the Enron Corporation which could have farreaching effects in the industry As a result many developers are heading into with a more cautious approach to

PACIFIC EASTERN BWTXINDUSTRIALINFORES Capital Spending for the Semiconductor Industry Shows Positive Signs Moving Into in an Advisory by Industrialinfocom BusinessEnergy Editors HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREJan An advisory from Industrialinfocom Industrial Information Resources Incorporated Houston Despite worldwide employment losses in the semiconductor industry new economic data may suggest an upturn in the industry during the second quarter of According to the recently released Semiconductor Billings Report produced by the Semiconductor Industry Association SIA and the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International SEMI association November global chip sales increased by Typically fourth quarter sales are normally high inline with the holiday season and though fourth quarter sales may still lag behind historical figures any consecutive rise in semiconductor sales may indicate that a bottom has formed and a recovery may be near Over the next few months consumer demand will dictate whether or not the upswing in sales will continue Currently the two biggest consumers of tech products relative to semiconductors are multinational corporations and telecommunications companies It is estimated that global spending for hardware and software by consumers will reach billion in Any further investments will be dictated by the future state of the economy During most semiconductor manufacturers scaled back production to reduce inventory levels while demand remained weak Many companies announced employee layoffs that will continue through For example one of the largest employment losses came from Motorola The company announced in December yet another layoff of employees By mid total losses for the company will account for over jobs since August NEC announced plans to suspend chip production in Scotland and lay off employees by April of Several domestic production plants of NEC have also been scaled back because of the economic downturn Santa Clara Califbased Applied Materials Inc recently announced that approximately positions at their Silicon Valley fab facility and roughly positions at their Austin campus would be cut Although the list continues employment data always lags behind other indicators These manufacturers are simply reducing costs during a period of uncertainty As the year unfolds semiconductor sales still remain in question Capital spending for the industry is expected to be down Some semiconductor manufacturers may continue to invest in process automations to stay ahead of the competition The next wave of production technology automation will come from the transition to mm silicon wafer production Semiconductor equipment vendors are pushing hard for manufacturers to modernize into new processes This could come soon Industry experts are forecasting a recovery by mid year spurred by consumer confidence If so semiconductor manufacturers may increase capital investments With inflation under control combined with eleven consecutive interest rate cuts that have made borrowing more attractive corporations have the right formula to move forward with automation and technology investments that will drive semiconductor manufacturers to expand Industrialinfocom is a leading provider of information in the industrial markets including the semiconductors industry For industrialinfocom released the

Executive or BW JAN PACIFIC EASTERN BWTXINDUSTRIALINFORES Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Design Pushes Renewed Interest in Worldwide Nuclear Power Generation in an Advisory by Industrialinfocom BusinessEnergy Editors HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREJan The following is an advisory by Industrialinfocom Industrial Information Resources Inc Houston The rehabilitation of nuclear power generation plants which could represent part of the answer to worlds power generation needs over the next years has taken a few steps forward in the consciousness of governments and industry in the past six months However nuclear power still has a way to go among environmental groups and those involved with postChernobyl public health concerns The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor PBMR from Eskom in South Africa continues to claim the attention of both the large power hungry regions and the capital conscious development areas to which the modular and smaller output plant could be both affordable and appropriate Stakeholders in the project include the US company Exelon with Eskom with British Nuclear Fuels with Industrial Development Corporation of SA with and Black empowerment at Currently Exelon is negotiating for the possible purchase of PBMRs at a price of around billion USD Early in the company requested the US National Regulatory Commission to start laying the groundwork for PBMR licensing Exelon would like to see the million demonstration unit which is planned by Eskom in South Africa as a proven model to show that all technical matters have been resolved and that safety efficiency and viability are proven enough for US regulatory agencies to proceed forward with licensing The plant is to be built alongside the existing nuclear power station at Koeberg in the Cape Province of South Africa with work commencing in If approved Exelon may then start concurrent construction of US sites to bring PBMRgenerated power to market at the earliest possible date and at the best price Specifications and claims by Eskom who purchased the technology after a year development and proving period in Germany present the PBMR as small safe clean cost efficient inexpensive and adaptable The PBMR uses multiple coated uranium particles encased in graphite to form a fuel sphere mm in diameter The PBMR design makes use of helium as the coolant and energy transfer medium to a closed cycle gas turbine and generator The design differences between the PBMR and Pressurized Water Reactors result in the PBMR being a safe and economical power plant The annual world market for power generation is estimated at billion The PBMR if it comes through its regulatory trials would be in a position to capture a tasty slice of this power action With of the shareholding in the PBMR project reserved for new black empowerment shareholders plant export orders a year could contribute nearly billion a year to South Africas Gross Domestic Product and another billion in export income An estimated direct and indirect jobs would be created These figures would double and triple for or orders annually If the demo plant achieves its targets Eskom will place an order for modules with the Exelon order hopefully kicking in immediately for a possible date for the first US plant in Eskom will sell PBMRs as a manufactured item with no rights given Eighty percent of the costs will be made up of the manufactured reactor and site construction related The aim is for of the sourcing to come from South Africa Taxpayers money approximately million so far is being spent by the South African authorities in giving all due diligence to the studies and to public feedback on the project before the go decision is given With this right and proper concern and the considerable market presence of Eskom and Exelon the MW modules will no doubt play a crucial role in the future of nuclear power generation The project managers are indicating growing confidence in their ability to bring the product to market and have recently made a significant move A contract has been placed in midJanuary with the US company Stone Webster and South African construction company Murray Roberts and black empowerment contractor Proman Management Services to provide consulting services to the PBMR project in engineering procurement construction management and project management Following this development the PBMR management at Eskom have gone on record to state that with the multinational and multidisciplinary support now providing leverage the approval hurdles for the pilot project should be cleared by the end of given the crucial general diligence and environmental clearance by the government Industrailinfocom provides daily news related to the industrial market place including

Information Resources Incorporated Houston Texas According to the latest release of the Industrial Outlook indoutlookhtm published by Industrial Information Resources portions of the industrial manufacturing sector will remain depressed for the upcoming year Capital spending remained moderately low in for the automotive printing publishing and plastics and rubber products molding industries Other industries such as semiconductor manufacturing and textiles and apparel experienced depressed market growth with very minimal capital investment taking place The automotive sector has been one of the strongest capital spending sectors over the last several years Americas Big Three producers have spent billions of dollars retooling plants to increase production of popular sport utility vehicles SUVs keeping up with demand and staying competitive with foreign automakers One of the major trends affecting capital spending in the automotive industry is the continuing effort by foreign automakers to transplant production operations to the US Billions of dollars have been spent by foreign owned automakers to construct new plants and build or expand tier supplier parts manufacturing plants Even with the slowdown in the economy this trend will continue in Bring up the words technology or high tech and the general public frowns over the losses that have been posted by this sector Semiconductor manufacturing has not been excluded from these losses Over the past several years this sector had been a large contributor of capital spending for the industrial manufacturing markets In Intel spent over billion building or expanding wafer fabrication plants However as the market turns down capital budgets are cut to make up for the losses being posted by most firms The worst hit semiconductor producers are those who manufacture memory devices Currently prices are at rockbottom lows In we saw plants layoff employees scale back production or even close or sell off manufacturing assets For IIR forecasts capital and maintenance spending for the industrial manufacturing sector to increase slightly from Coverage of this industry includes over different sectors including automotive heavy machinery electronics semiconductors textiles apparel printing and publishing durable and non durable product manufacturing IIRs recently released Industrial Outlook available on CDROM outlines in detail issues and trends including capital and maintenance spending for the Industrial Manufacturing Industry and other industrial market segments For more information on the

Executive or BW JAN PACIFIC EASTERN BWTXINDUSTRIALINFORES Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Design Pushes Renewed Interest in Worldwide Nuclear Power Generation in an Advisory by Industrialinfocom BusinessEnergy Editors HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREJan The following is an advisory by Industrialinfocom Industrial Information Resources Inc Houston The rehabilitation of nuclear power generation plants which could represent part of the answer to worlds power generation needs over the next years has taken a few steps forward in the consciousness of governments and industry in the past six months However nuclear power still has a way to go among environmental groups and those involved with postChernobyl public health concerns The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor PBMR from Eskom in South Africa continues to claim the attention of both the large power hungry regions and the capital conscious development areas to which the modular and smaller output plant could be both affordable and appropriate Stakeholders in the project include the US company Exelon with Eskom with British Nuclear Fuels with Industrial Development Corporation of SA with and Black empowerment at Currently Exelon is negotiating for the possible purchase of PBMRs at a price of around billion USD Early in the company requested the US National Regulatory Commission to start laying the groundwork for PBMR licensing Exelon would like to see the million demonstration unit which is planned by Eskom in South Africa as a proven model to show that all technical matters have been resolved and that safety efficiency and viability are proven enough for US regulatory agencies to proceed forward with licensing The plant is to be built alongside the existing nuclear power station at Koeberg in the Cape Province of South Africa with work commencing in If approved Exelon may then start concurrent construction of US sites to bring PBMRgenerated power to market at the earliest possible date and at the best price Specifications and claims by Eskom who purchased the technology after a year development and proving period in Germany present the PBMR as small safe clean cost efficient inexpensive and adaptable The PBMR uses multiple coated uranium particles encased in graphite to form a fuel sphere mm in diameter The PBMR design makes use of helium as the coolant and energy transfer medium to a closed cycle gas turbine and generator The design differences between the PBMR and Pressurized Water Reactors result in the PBMR being a safe and economical power plant The annual world market for power generation is estimated at billion The PBMR if it comes through its regulatory trials would be in a position to capture a tasty slice of this power action With of the shareholding in the PBMR project reserved for new black empowerment shareholders plant export orders a year could contribute nearly billion a year to South Africas Gross Domestic Product and another billion in export income An estimated direct and indirect jobs would be created These figures would double and triple for or orders annually If the demo plant achieves its targets Eskom will place an order for modules with the Exelon order hopefully kicking in immediately for a possible date for the first US plant in Eskom will sell PBMRs as a manufactured item with no rights given Eighty percent of the costs will be made up of the manufactured reactor and site construction related The aim is for of the sourcing to come from South Africa Taxpayers money approximately million so far is being spent by the South African authorities in giving all due diligence to the studies and to public feedback on the project before the go decision is given With this right and proper concern and the considerable market presence of Eskom and Exelon the MW modules will no doubt play a crucial role in the future of nuclear power generation The project managers are indicating growing confidence in their ability to bring the product to market and have recently made a significant move A contract has been placed in midJanuary with the US company Stone Webster and South African construction company Murray Roberts and black empowerment contractor Proman Management Services to provide consulting services to the PBMR project in engineering procurement construction management and project management Following this development the PBMR management at Eskom have gone on record to state that with the multinational and multidisciplinary support now providing leverage the approval hurdles for the pilot project should
