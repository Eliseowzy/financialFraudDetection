YOUR SUPPORT Original Message From Arnold John Sent Monday October PM To Abramo Caroline Subject RE Back office issues If these problems are not being addressed as they should be call me and Ill get on it This is unacceptable Original Message From Abramo Caroline Sent Sunday October PM To Lagrasta Fred Cc Dyk Russell Zivic Robyn Subject Back office issues Fred There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint heres a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the counterparties we have added in the last months I shouldnt have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out It has been days since we traded and we havent received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for We did not trade contracts per day it was per month do you guys even think before you type I am a CFO and an accountant and I cant decipher what you are trying to confirm here From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers One upon the mentioning of BB exchanges said they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare they couldnt rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm This was a captive client who and needs to trade who will not show us their flow again The latest is the most disturbing we just want to do a small trade to test your system We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of lots of crude And still days later they do not have one paper to show the details not one phone call to confirm the tradenothing We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently Well clearly we failed We do not understand what is going on in the back office Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business Is there too much turnover How are they trained Who is in charge of the backoffice There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process who coordinates all their efforts Does anyone care Ok Ill stop For our part we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her We have to stop this before we lose clients which we will All the problems are being caused by the following Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients This has already cost us money this year Our clients do trades a day they are constantly in and out of positions it is imperative that we get these right As well this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system There are hundreds of books at Enron We have postions on with dozens of them We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot We have to select books one by one this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow Michelle is in charge of this process We need a IT person on this yesterday Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates Robyn Russell and I check it everyday there are always mistakes There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them There is no check after they have been imput There are ALWAYS imput errors Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals We have no idea where our job ends and the book admins starts for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish a Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered what if deals are imput incorrectly the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client Going forward confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct b Invoicing there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done EOL We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here we have signed Renaissance up a B program fund but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks Credit All of our clients are margined If deals are in the system incorrectly the wrong MTM goes to the client another mismatch We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients this amount changes daily we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through again we are doing this now
