for shareholders then you are more out of touch with reality than I previously thought unless you were referring to Dynegy shareholders Under your leadership the shareholders have been devastated employees have lost their retirements college funds have been desiminated and reputations have been ruined including your own While I applaud your forgoing of the million dollar payment I suspect having taken it would have only added to outrage and probably weakend your position in forthcoming lawsuits and dont feel that it was as self efacing as you have lead us to believe Under your direction Enron has promoted bafoons charletons and incompetents to the highest management ranks You personally did everything imaginable to lose the confidence of the investment community in my opinion This has got to be the financial disaster of the decade all under your direction You said Jeff Skilling left for personal reasons and there were not hidden financial problems You told us you were becoming more transparent in financial disclosures and then tried to slip a Billion dollar equity reduction by us The list goes on and on Why should we believe you now One more thing Mr Lay I suggest take the listing of executive awards off the internet site I suspect new awards will be coming out soon And please dont waste your time sending me self serving feel good memos anymore I finally caught on to you Forwarded by Deane PierceCorpEnron on AM Ken Lay Office of the Chairman AM Sent by General Announcement To All Enron Worldwide Distribution Group cc Subject Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy Today we announced plans to merge with Dynegy a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at updates If you have additional questions please submit them to mailto We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions If you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company Rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and
