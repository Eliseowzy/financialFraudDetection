<4268563.1075852770846.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jaime.gualy@enron.com,2001-10-26 09:02:41,FW Comments on the Status of ENE sh Authored by Jeff Dietert OUR VIEW ENE is down huge for the year and trading at only xFY and its hard to imagine more confusion associated with the stock More pressure is likely today on the news of SP revising its longterm ratings outlook to negative based on the decline in market capitalization and ENEs additional draw on its credit facilities which does not change its net debt but prevents banks from denying access to its liquidity in the event that the rating agencies do downgrade its credit rating which could break covenants and restrict liquidity We believe the major issues are managements ability to regain the confidence of the street and persuade investors that it can restore balance sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow ENE must maintain its investment grade credit rating ENE must successfully execute its divestiture plans and ENE must control the timing of the recognition of the writedown in the value of any assets whose market value is less than book IF ENE management does not stepup to calm investor fears these fears could become a self fulfilling prophecy In the potentially vicious cycle investor fears could drive the stock down the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades potentially lower credit ratings force counterparties to reduce exposure with ENE limiting ENEs to generate earnings and cash flow Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to clarify the issues We expect ENE to put together a more complete explanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to stabilize the stock Ifwhen ENE schedules a conference call or road show we would consider this a bullish sign Absent further clarification the stock is likely to continue to be weak Our gut feel is that ENE can pull it off and that longterm investors should hold firm as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings with upside potential to sh over the next to month period rather than breakup value shsee below We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until ENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery ENEs VIEW ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur Anderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than an approximate MM charge expected in Q due to an accounting change With no further asset writedowns and roughly MM in asset divestitures MM India EP MM Puerto Rico power plant and MM Brazilian power plant in Q ENEs DTC ratio is likely to decline from at the end of Q to roughly at the end of the year After the close of the Portland General divestiture expected by yearend we expect its DTC to fall below we are projecting FCF to be breakeven in FY We estimate that ENEs interest coverage at the end of Q is x ENE is currently rated BBB by SP and Baa by Moodys and would need to decline ratings to fall below investment grade For comparison purposes SPs BBB median DTC is and EBITDAInt Exp coverage is x while BB noninvestment grade median DTC is and interest coverage is x IMPORTANCE OF ENEs INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING We believe that ENEs Wholesale segments which generates of its EBIT would be noncompetitive if the credit rating falls below investment grade In addition a decline in credit rating below investment grade would trigger the issuance of MM shares of common stock and B in convertible preferred stock associated with ENEs offbalance sheet structured financing vehicles We believe ENE will do what ever it can to maintain an investment grade rating Moodys has its BBB rating under review for a possible downgrade Last night SP revised its longterm ratings outlook to negative due to concerns that the significant drop in market capitalization in the past week has adversely affected the companys financial flexibility and could impede its ability to pursue plans to rebuild its balance sheet BREAKUP VALUE We believe ENE s Wholesale America B in TTM EBITDA Wholesale Europe MM and Retail MM segments are conservatively worth a x multiple recent multiples have been higher but we are discounting due to limited buying interest or B The Gas Pipeline segment MM and Global Assets MM valued at a x multiple are worth B PGE valued at the divestiture price is B Total asset value is conservatively B vs debt of B leaving B or sh for equity investors in a breakup scenario The challenge is if ENE loses its investment grade rating the value B of its Wholesale and Retail segments would be materially compromisedleaving little for equity investors POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS ENEs Global Assets portfolio includes assets with B in book value ENEs total gross PPE is B that has generated an EBIT loss of MM EBITDA of MM over the last month period Q to Q The Global Assets portfolio includes Elektro an electric utility in Brazil Dabhol power plant in India TGS a natural gas pipeline in Argentina Azurix and Enron Wind operations These assets seem ripe for a writedown although the company argues that it has reviewed them with Arthur Anderson recently and that the assets are not impaired ENE will have to continue to convince Anderson that the value of these assets has not been impaired The writedown of these assets would reduce shareholder equity and ENEs DTC threatening its credit rating It is not clear that ENE put all its underperforming assets in the Global Assets portfolio There could be other poor performing assets in other segments that are hidden by strong performance in its Wholesale business ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS ENEs counterparties seem to be supportive and have not indicated any change in business activity EnronOnline trading volume was slightly above average yesterday Some energy traders have bought ENE in their personal accounts convinced that ENE core marketing business is strong and the belief that the equity markets have overreacted Lots of ENE corporate finance people are working late nights solidifying ENEs financial strategy hopefully for a more complete discussion with the street THE SEC INQUIRY We believe ENE has an extensive paper trail from its attorneys and accountants that will clear them of any legal problems with the SEC associated with the LJM partnerships in which CFO Andy Fastow participated We do not expect the SEC to find any legal wrongdoingalthough this doesnt mean that they wont express qualitative concern over the appearance of the transactions This email is based on information

IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE November New Power Plant Planned fo r New York City By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis N ews item from Energy Info Source New York states siting board approved As toria Energys plans to build a megawatt power plant in New York City clearing the way for construction to begin as early as January Astoria E nergy hopes to have the naturalgasfired combinedcycle plant that will b e at an existing oil terminal in the Astoria section of Queens in service b y The company must do a certain amount of demolition and site prepara tion before it can begin construction and still must receive some local pe rmits from New York City Astoria Energy is a unit of SCS Energy LLC a pri vately owned energy development company based in Concord Mass Analysis The announcement of a new power plant scheduled for the New York City are a should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply problems th at have been identified within this region Like California New York also suffers from a supply demand imbalance However even if or when power su pply can be increased in New York the core load center of New York City st ill suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue to take t heir own toll on the stability of the market In other words transmission capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the extent th at power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported The fact that Ast oria Energy has received approval from New York states siting board to pro ceed with this New York Citybased plant is significant but it should not be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from city gov ernment This could be easier said than done as other planned power plants in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the last year by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who ardently voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new plant con struction The problems within the New York power market have been well d ocumented The state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant onl ine since when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven years since a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate Further New York expects only a percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years Consequently concerns about the states ability to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval st eps for siting new plants in the state However at the same time environm ental and community groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and o ften lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will produce powe r While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages the probl em appears to be particularly acute in New York City A November repor t issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC entitled Inves tigation of Bulk Power Markets Northeast Region highlighted specific cap acity problems in the New York CityLong Island community of million peo ple These areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the states grid the study said Like Northern California which suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints New York City a nd Long Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained t ransmission lines Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York but cannot reach the city Being both densely populated and heavily r esidential it is difficult to site new power plants in the area Consequen tly percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the cit y New plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because New York City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at times during the course of The projected shortfall is expected to inc rease by another MW by summer Increased demand is causing addi tional problems for the energy markets of New York City and New York State Demand in the state rose by MW from to or times as fa st as new generation capacity was added Demand over the course of was expected to reach MW or about percent above regulators earlie r forecasts It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will p roceed with its plans for the new power plant in New York City Astoria Ene rgy is a private company seeking to generate electric power with energyeff icient and environmentally sound technologies in the New York City area Th e company is a subsidiary of SCS Energy a privately owned energy developme nt company formed in for the purpose of developing and owning new elec tric generating facilities Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds some additional light on the proposed plant As noted the MW unit wi ll be a natural gasfired facility which will obtain natural gas supplied from the ConEdNew York facility pipeline The capital cost for the plant r eportedly will be million Commercial operation pending the necessary approvals on the local level is scheduled for the fourth quarter of Astoria Energy is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for the new plant because it will be using a technology that is specifically ge ared toward the reduction of air emissions However despite this optimi sm the community opposition factor should not be discounted and there are several examples that may foreshadow the opposition that Astoria Energy co uld face Take Sithe Energies for example which hit a roadblock with its construction plans in the New York area earlier this year Sithe Energies o riginally planned a MW combinedcycle facility fueled by natural gas in Ramapo NY Chief among the concerns of local residents is that the Ramap o plant was originally planned to run all the time to meet demand and as a result would use local water resources for cooling purposes Community res istance thus became an issue for the company which altered its plans and b egan to consider a MW peaking unit also powered by natural gas that w ould only be operated in times of increased demand As another example environmental and community groups won a victory in court just last week t hat essentially will block construction of small power plants in the South Bronx Brooklyn Queens and Long Island areas Each is a MW plant thou gh at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than MW A coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in these areas and sued the New York Power Authority claiming among other th ings that the state had failed to perform adequate environmentalreview st udies The groups claim that the state should test the plants for their out put of fine particulate matter A lower court had ruled in favor of the sta te but a judgment last week in the New York Court of Appeals was clearly a win for the environmental and community groups The new ruling which repo rtedly cannot be appealed further says that the state must do unprecedente d air tests at the plants or shut them down by Jan In a report issued earlier this year New York State Electric Gas Corp NYSEG one of New Yorks seven utilities said the state will not have enough megawatt s to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until NYSE G in a report issued late Wednesday warned there are serious problems wi th New Yorks generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline i nfrastructure According to data included in a separate report by the New York ISO which manages the states transmission grid between and while statewide demand in New York rose by MW generating capacity under contract in the state reportedly increased only by MW Cons equently given all of these factors power supplies in New York remained s trained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of new g eneration capacity However Astoria Energy which seeks to bring new gener ation online in New York that will be based on clean technologies may stil l face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the const ruction of any new plants in the region with the exception of peaker units whose output would be closely regimented If plans for this plant are bl ocked or significantly altered following the experience of Sithe Energies the options to resolve New York Citys supply demand imbalance will once again become focused on a combination of other approaches including conse rvation efforts and reliance on distributed generation alternatives An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is

pouring in So far only one company NRG Energy NRG rated Strong Buy a pure play IPP has reported earnings and the quarter was slightly better than expected NRG also reaffirmed its full year and EPS guidance Based upon the number of favorable preannouncements that greatly outnumbered the number of negative preannouncements we remain confident that the third quarter reports should be relatively strong for most electric utilities and IPPs We continue to recommend an overweighting in the electric stocks In an environment of economic slowdown and falling interest rates utility stocks should perform relatively well In addition utility stocks still appear undervalued based upon historic valuation measures Utility stocks are now trading at an average PE ratio of x estimated EPS compared with a PE ratio of x for the SP The relative PE ratio of x is well below the year historic normal range of xx American Electric Power AEP rated Buy agreed to acquire two huge coalfired power plants in the UK from Edison International EIX rated Buy EIXs subsidiary Edison Mission Energy sold the Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge power plants each one MW in size for a big loss Since the time when EIX bought the two power plants in power prices in the UK have fallen sharply and the country is now oversupplied with electric power Power prices are expected to remain low in the UK for quite a while AEP agreed to pay million for the power plants and certain fuel supplies For AEP the purchase price for the power plants is about per kilowatt Edison International paid about twice as much when it purchased the plants in EIX said that it intends to take an aftertax writeoff of about billion to reflect the loss on the asset sale and related currency adjustments Niagara Mohawk Power NMK rated Buy National Grid Group the Staff of the New York Public Service Commission and several other parties announced a settlement that includes a rate plan for ten years following the proposed merger of NMK and National Grid Under the agreement Niagara Mohawk would reduce rates for electricity delivery by million or upon closing of the merger Following this onetime rate cut delivery charges would remain stable for the next ten years The settlement is based upon a return on equity with an earnings sharing plan The plan allows NMK to retain of earnings up to an ROE with sharing for earnings above an ROE The plan also allows NMK to retain of mergerrelated savings and the ROE sharing plan does not include the retained savings The agreement also requires NMK to give up recovery of million of nuclearrelated stranded costs The Public Service Commission is expected to vote on the settlement by late We would expect the state regulators to approve the settlement and to approve the merger at the same time The merger is expected to be completed in the first quarter of Now it appears that Public Service of New Mexico PNM rated Hold has decided to go to court to terminate its pending acquisition of Western Resources utility business WR rated Hold On Friday PNM issued a press release saying that PNM had asked a court in New York to resolve the disagreement between PNM and WR regarding the merger PNM is asking the court to find that it is impossible to complete the proposed transaction under the original terms PNM also wants the court to rule that the electric rate reduction imposed by regulators in Kansas provides sufficient cause to terminate the merger agreement The CEO of PNM also said that PNM believes that the current agreement must be restructured if there is any chance of the merger going ahead However WR has demanded that the original transaction be pursued even though certain rulings by state regulators in Kansas appear to make this nearly impossible PNM and Western had agreed previously that WR had to complete its corporate separation plan separating its utility operations from its nonutility businesses before the merger could be completed However the regulators in Kansas refused to approve the terms of WRs corporate separation plan and they have ordered a halt to the implementation of the separation plan Kansas regulators want changes to be made to the corporate separation plan in order to provide a stronger balance sheet for the utility post separation The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC approved the acquisition of PowerGen of the UK by German utility EOn last week Also last week regulators in the state of Virginia approved the acquisition Previously the state of Kentucky also approved the deal The approvals from FERC Virginia and Kentucky were needed because PowerGen owns LGE Energy the US electric utility that serves most of Kentucky and a portion of Virginia The SEC still needs to approve the merger which is expected to be completed in the spring of We expect EOn to use this deal as a springboard toward making several other acquisitions of US utilities Right next door to LGE Energy is

Subject FW Comments on the Status of ENE sh Authored by Jeff Dietert OUR VIEW ENE is down huge for the year and trading at only xFY and its hard to imagine more confusion associated with the stock More pressure is likely today on the news of SP revising its longterm ratings outlook to negative based on the decline in market capitalization and ENEs additional draw on its credit facilities which does not change its net debt but prevents banks from denying access to its liquidity in the event that the rating agencies do downgrade its credit rating which could break covenants and restrict liquidity We believe the major issues are managements ability to regain the confidence of the street and persuade investors that it can restore balance sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow ENE must maintain its investment grade credit rating ENE must successfully execute its divestiture plans and ENE must control the timing of the recognition of the writedown in the value of any assets whose market value is less than book IF ENE management does not stepup to calm investor fears these fears could become a self fulfilling prophecy In the potentially vicious cycle investor fears could drive the stock down the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades potentially lower credit ratings force counterparties to reduce exposure with ENE limiting ENEs to generate earnings and cash flow Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to clarify the issues We expect ENE to put together a more complete explanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to stabilize the stock Ifwhen ENE schedules a conference call or road show we would consider this a bullish sign Absent further clarification the stock is likely to continue to be weak Our gut feel is that ENE can pull it off and that longterm investors should hold firm as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings with upside potential to sh over the next to month period rather than breakup value shsee below We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until ENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery ENEs VIEW ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur Anderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than an approximate MM charge expected in Q due to an accounting change With no further asset writedowns and roughly MM in asset divestitures MM India EP MM Puerto Rico power plant and MM Brazilian power plant in Q ENEs DTC ratio is likely to decline from at the end of Q to roughly at the end of the year After the close of the Portland General divestiture expected by yearend we expect its DTC to fall below we are projecting FCF to be breakeven in FY We estimate that ENEs interest coverage at the end of Q is x ENE is currently rated BBB by SP and Baa by Moodys and would need to decline ratings to fall below investment grade For comparison purposes SPs BBB median DTC is and EBITDAInt Exp coverage is x while BB noninvestment grade median DTC is and interest coverage is x IMPORTANCE OF ENEs INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING We believe that ENEs Wholesale segments which generates of its EBIT would be noncompetitive if the credit rating falls below investment grade In addition a decline in credit rating below investment grade would trigger the issuance of MM shares of common stock and B in convertible preferred stock associated with ENEs offbalance sheet structured financing vehicles We believe ENE will do what ever it can to maintain an investment grade rating Moodys has its BBB rating under review for a possible downgrade Last night SP revised its longterm ratings outlook to negative due to concerns that the significant drop in market capitalization in the past week has adversely affected the companys financial flexibility and could impede its ability to pursue plans to rebuild its balance sheet BREAKUP VALUE We believe ENE s Wholesale America B in TTM EBITDA Wholesale Europe MM and Retail MM segments are conservatively worth a x multiple recent multiples have been higher but we are discounting due to limited buying interest or B The Gas Pipeline segment MM and Global Assets MM valued at a x multiple are worth B PGE valued at the divestiture price is B Total asset value is conservatively B vs debt of B leaving B or sh for equity investors in a breakup scenario The challenge is if ENE loses its investment grade rating the value B of its Wholesale and Retail segments would be materially compromisedleaving little for equity investors POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS ENEs Global Assets portfolio includes assets with B in book value ENEs total gross PPE is B that has generated an EBIT loss of MM EBITDA of MM over the last month period Q to Q The Global Assets portfolio includes Elektro an electric utility in Brazil Dabhol power plant in India TGS a natural gas pipeline in Argentina Azurix and Enron Wind operations These assets seem ripe for a writedown although the company argues that it has reviewed them with Arthur Anderson recently and that the assets are not impaired ENE will have to continue to convince Anderson that the value of these assets has not been impaired The writedown of these assets would reduce shareholder equity and ENEs DTC threatening its credit rating It is not clear that ENE put all its underperforming assets in the Global Assets portfolio There could be other poor performing assets in other segments that are hidden by strong performance in its Wholesale business ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS ENEs counterparties seem to be supportive and have not indicated any change in business activity EnronOnline trading volume was slightly above average yesterday Some energy traders have bought ENE in their personal accounts convinced that ENE core marketing business is strong and the belief that the equity markets have overreacted Lots of ENE corporate finance people are working late nights solidifying ENEs financial strategy hopefully for a more complete discussion with the street THE SEC INQUIRY We believe ENE has an extensive paper trail from its attorneys and accountants that will clear them of any legal problems with the SEC associated with the LJM partnerships in which CFO Andy Fastow participated We do not expect the SEC to find any legal wrongdoingalthough this doesnt mean that they wont express qualitative concern over the appearance of the transactions This email is based on information obtained from sources which Simmons Company International believes to be reliable

Monday November AM To undisclosedrecipientsENRON Subject Electric Utilities Weekly Update KEY POINTS On the basis of the groups extremely low relative valuation we continue to recommend the electric utility group The electric groups PE based upon estimated EPS is now only x compared with a PE for the SP of x The relative PE ratio has dropped to just x near its alltime low of x and well below the year historic normal relative PE range of x to x The high relative yield of on the average electric utility stock also should provide good support against any major downward move in our opinion The relative yield on utility stocks is more than double the yields available to small investors in cash equivalents such as money market funds The fullyregulated transmission and distribution utilities TD appear to have stopped outperforming the utilities that have a large merchant energy exposure The lowerrisk higheryielding TD stocks had been going up for most of the past few months while the utilities with merchant energy had been falling Now it appears that the rotation into the TD stocks has ended at least for now Last week we added PPL Corp PPL rated Strong Buy to our Global Top List of utility stocks The major reasons for adding PPL to the Global Top List were the stocks very low relative PE ratio its fleet of lowcost unregulated generating plants and its aboveaverage earnings growth potential We also believe it is likely that PPL might take actions to improve its very low stock price such as a dividend hike and a common share buyback In addition at PPLs current low relative valuation we believe it is an attractive takeover target There are four other US utility stocks on our Global Top ListDominion Resources D rated Strong Buy Duke Energy DUK rated Strong Buy TXU Corp TXU rated Strong Buy and American Electric Power AEP rated Buy The rest of our Global Top List includes El Paso Energy EPG of the US SuezLyonnaise and Lattice Group of Europe and Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric of Asia The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued an order last week that changes the basis upon which FERC will allow large utilities to sell wholesale power at marketbased rates FERCs order is designed to reduce the possibility that a large company could exert market power in a particular region FERC stated that if power sellers are found to be pivotal to their region and if the sellers are not participating in a FERC approved regional transmission organization RTO then the sellers could lose their right to charge marketbased rates Sellers that are pivotal to their region have generating units that must run to meet the regions electric load FERC applied these new rules immediately to three large utilitiesAmerican Electric Power Entergy Corp ETR rated Hold and Southern Company SO rated Hold FERC stated that all three of these large utilities are not now currently members of a FERC approved RTO AEP ETR and SO have lost the authority to make sales at marketbased rates except for sales that take place in regions where the grid is controlled by a FERCapproved RTO The three companies have been given days to respond by FERC Under the new rules FERC can order refunds and can order these companies to revert back to costbased rates It is possible that FERC is using this directive to strongly influence the rapid formation of FERCapproved RTOs Some of the larger US utilities have been reluctant to join large RTOs and have tried to form their own RTOs in which they would be the dominant member In the long run we expect FERC to prevail and we expect all US utilities large and small to form RTOs that have FERC approval We think that the loss of the ability to sell wholesale power at marketbased rates even if only for a short period of time until the company achieves compliance with FERCs RTO goals is a strong enough incentive for large utilities to move faster to join large RTOs We lowered our EPS estimates for Edison International EIX rated Buy after the company held a conference call last week at which time it gave new earnings guidance for and We lowered our EPS estimate from to and reduced our EPS estimate from to It appears that EIXs major emphasis over the next to years will be to improve its balance sheet and regain its financial health and therefore earnings growth does not appear to be a major objective We reduced our EPS estimate on Cinergy Corp CIN rated Strong Buy from to Lower forward power prices for and the weakness in the local economy are likely to hurt earnings TXU announced two major asset divestitures in the United Kingdom last week TXU plans to sell its UK electric distribution business and its interest in seven to London Electricity for billion TXU also announced an agreement to sell its MW West Burton power station to London Electricity for million We think that both of these moves are positive steps for TXU Additional details can be found in the following

mailtoIMCEANOTESMiroPasicCMiroEPasicmorganstanleyEcomE NRONcom Sent Thursday September AM To Miro Pasic Subject Assesing the Impact on Various Industries The following is a brief summary of our analysts views on the impact of the WTC tragedy on different industriessectors More detailed reports can be found on our client link website Industry Company Updates REITs Life Insurance Annuities Oils Specialty Finance Asset Management Brokerage Insurance PropertyCasualty LeisureCruise lines Storage Electrical Utility Advertising REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS WTCS IMPACT ON MANHATTAN OFFICE REITS Could see as much as million sqft of downtown office impacted Companies with major office exposure in NYC Brookfield Properties has the most significant downtown office exposure Boston Properties Equity Office SL Green and Vornado have most assets in Midtown Suburban office companies may see increased demand Reckson and MackCali have the most significant New York metro suburban office exposure Consequently our rating on CLI is under review LIFE INSURANCE ANNUITIES ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE WTC TRAGEDY The tragic events of September will impact several operations Group and individual life insurance disability COLI and even annuity operations will be impacted by the disaster at the World Trade Center and Pentagon on Tuesday Institutional operations and reinsurance will likely be hardest hit Life reinsurers and companies with significant group life and group disability operations will likely face significantly higher losses as they pay the claims of the victims Difficult to assess individual company impact so far It is logical to expect that New York domicile companies will have higher exposure We also expect fundamentals of companies with large group life ADD and disability to be under pressure We are waiting on additional information before adjusting estimates Industry fundamentals will likely come under pressure and estimates will fall materially for several companies However we believe the industry has substantial excess capital to absorb these losses ENERGY OILS CRUDE OIL OUTLOOK UPDATED BP REMAINS FAVORITE Crude Oil Outlook For H But Supply and demand to be balanced during H with stocks to remain around days forward demand This is a positive price scenario Recent Global Tensions to Require Reassessment Demand will likely slow with reduced economic growth Output disruption in Afghanistan would have a negligible impact on markets Iraq and Iran would be significantly more concerning Maintain Market Position With Positive Bias Super Major BP PT sh remains our favorite integrated oil with ExxonMobil and RoyalDutchShell expected to Outperform as well FINANCE SPECIALTYMORTGAGE ISSUES TO CONSIDER IN THE AFTERMATH Reassessing fundamentals in aftermath of WTC attack While we cant opine with confidence on macroeconomic trends or investor sentiment we can reassess the fundamental outlook for our two sectors in the light of greater uncertainty Remain confident in mortgage finance fundamentals The housing markets benefit from secular drivers that should help withstand potential impact of the WTC attack on consumer confidence or economic growth Patience may still be required in the credit card sector While were encouraged by the slowdown in consumer credit growth we feel it is too early to bet on a turn in the credit cycle ASSET MANAGEMENT BROKERAGE TAKING STOCK Providing Some Perspective on this weeks Tragedy Details are still coming in but in the nearterm we expect reduced capacity and higher volatility in the brokerage sector For asset managers continued weak flows Nearterm Tug of War is likely Key issues are the unsettled global markets partially offset by the potential for additional central bank liquidity Separately infrastructure and operational issues will make things choppy at best Are globalization deregulation and retirement savings still the key We think so but we acknowledge a backlash towards global connectivity could slow capital flows expansion and consolidation INSURANCE PROPERTYCASUALTY THE AFTERMATH OF TRAGEDY Largest loss by all accounts The World Trade Center attack will be the largest insured event in history Our current working range of losses is billion This is up to higher than figures being quoted by some others We believe such a loss would not pose a bankruptcy threat or rating threat to most major insurers Strong companies will recoup losses through higher rates Being adequately capitalized companies with strong claimspaying ratings will be wellpositioned to write profitable business at much higher rates in Investors should try not to overreact When the market opens we would not sell into panic and for stocks that you otherwise want to own we would add on weakness LEISURECRUISE LINES WHERE IS VALUATION SUPPORTIVE Recent Strength In Cruise Demand Primed To Reverse Despite recent positive signals surrounding cruise demand there is no question in our mind that bookings will slow over the next several months in the wake of current events in NYC and DC Lowering Demand Growth Assumption To From As such were taking down our industry yield assumption to and our EPS estimates by for Carnival and for Royal Caribbean The Big Question How Will The Market React Once Trading Resumes To prepare ourselves for all potential outcomes we conducted a valuation sensitivity analysis showing what levels the stocks should be considered oversold fairly valued and over valued We Expect A Hit To Cruise Stock Prices This would leave the stocks as cheap as they should get on real numbers even in recessionary times With or more wed be buyers With little move wed likely be sellers ELECTRIC UTILITIESUNREGULATED POWER DEFENSIVE PORTS IN A STORM Electric power stocks should benefit from flight to quality We expect regulated and unregulatedintegrated groups to perform well relative to the market when trading resumes as investors rotate into defensive stocks Regulated utilities are classic defensive stocks Our favorite integrated names that are still heavily regulated monopolies with safe dividends are FPL TXU and ETR each trading at X E and yields of Integrateds have served as bellweathers in such difficult times We would also be buyers of highly liquid solid welldiversified integrated utilities DUK and D are our favorites among such a list Unregulateds inherently defensive may benefit from greater volatility Little exposure to consumer confidence as primary end market of electricity sales are highly stable and resistant to economic cycles Our favorites are CPN MIR AD HOC ADVERTISING AND MARKETING SERVICES THE MOURNING AFTER ASSESSING History of wars impact on ad spending indicates potential lift for Looking at five wars since US ad spending showed an incremental lift of basis points on average during the first year of war Outdoor and Magazine ad media have outperformed in similar times These two media increased and respectively during the five major US wars of this century Radio Newspapers and Broadcast TV follow with growth of and Morgan Stanley economists seem to be assuming market correction Advertising Marketing Services consumeroriented clients are likely to have more valuation downside All of our consumer sectors should be considered market weight Companies associated with consumer staples may be safer right now Catalina and Valassis could be considered slightly safer if their consumer staples advertisers in groceries and pharmacies retrench less than other marketers ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY ANALYSIS Enterprise Software Impact For the near term we see incremental risk for the September quarter since software companies tend to close most of the deals in the last ten days of the quarter Decisionmakers are likely to be preoccupied with other decisions Companies with particular expsosure the brokerage community such as Tibco and Advent Software portfolio management software would be at the top of the list for incremental risk in the short term Longer term these events underscore the need for backup and recovery software and Veritas would likely see some benefit over time as well as Oracle whos database has built in features for replication and hot backup capabilities in conjunction with Veritas Reliability and recovery issues will become more important items on the checklist as will consulting services Oracle will go forward with its earnings release this evening after the close of the market We are expecting cents per share in earnings
