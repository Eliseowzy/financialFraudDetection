<15689112.1075859094783.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bstephen@academicplanet.com,2001-12-08 07:47:22,NEON RetreatHo ho ho were around to that most wonderful time of the yearNEON leaders retreat time I know that this time of year is extremely hectic and that its tough to think about anything past the holidays but life does go on past the week of December through January and thats what Id like you to think about for a minute On the calender that I handed out at the beginning of the fall semester the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of January But because of a youth ministers conference that Brad and Dustin are connected with that week were going to change the date to the following weekend January Now comes the part you need to think about I think we all agree that its important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids etc So Brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend and then you can let me know which you prefer The first option would be to have a retreat similar to what weve done the past several years This year we could go to the Heartland Country Inn wwwheartlandcountryinncom outside of Brenham Its a nice place where wed have a bedroom and a bedroom house side by side Its in the country real relaxing but also close to Brenham and only about one hour and minutes from here We can golf shop in the antique and craft stores in Brenham eat dinner together at the ranch and spend time with each other Wed meet on Saturday and then return on Sunday morning just like what weve done in the past The second option would be to stay here in Houston have dinner together at a nice restaurant and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that Saturday evening This might be easier but the trade off would be that we wouldnt have as much time together Ill let you decide Email me back with what would be your preference and of course if youre available on that weekend The democratic process will prevailmajority vote will rule Let me hear from you as soon as possible preferably by the end of the weekend And if the vote doesnt go your way no complaining allowed like I tend to do Have a great weekend great golf great fishing great shopping or whatever makes you happy Bobby
