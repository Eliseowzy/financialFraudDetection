<9512890.1075855034324.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kltaylor@duke-energy.com,2001-10-16 12:19:24,REJust as long as were clear that the Aggies never lose they are only outscored I think QGM is probably the only place you could take it but even that is not a slam dunk Blacks Fork is full with the mmcfd weve been sending them QGM has agreed to take about mmcfd of unprocessed gas in addition to the d but it has to be blended for with Shute Creek gas in order for QPL to take it There is also a gathering fee on QGM I think Since Im new to this whole game and my shop hasnt taken over the gas control yet thank God for small favors Im not exactly sure how the capacity at the QGM delivery point is being allocated Sherry Anderson at AEC is still performing this service on a temporary basis Your Petrogulf contact should give her a call to understand the options better tomorrow should work If you find that you can get away sooner just give me a call as I will likely work until then Im flexible on the cuisine so we dont have to do sushi I do love it though It kind of has to grow on you because I didnt like it much at first Thai too spicy for you Pick your favorite place and well go there As for your comment regarding Richard and the information I divulged above I think you and I both agree that youre forever indebted to me kt Lucci Paul T To Karen L Taylor PaulTLucci cc enroncom Subject RE AM Excuses Excuses the reason you lost was that your team scored less points than the team you were playing Its that simple Anyway as for dinner what about staying downtown and meeting around pm if thats too late we can meet earlier The only thing I know that is healthy is Sushi which isnt my favorite but Id go if thats a big thing for you Or we can come up with other ideas Im wide open Ill eat anything except for Thai The lady Im dealing with at Petrogulf is clueless The guy I used to deal with is gone and she is new to this area of the business Since Im so nice and receptive to her feelings I decided to help But Im sure you already know this about my personality Im really not trying to BS you with my emotional side I will tell her I can buy the gas into Questar if you believe that to be the case All those other delivery points need processing arrangements Dont tell Richard Stewart anything about this conversation or YOUR buying dinner Original Message From Karen L Taylor mailto Sent Tuesday October AM To Lucci Paul T Subject RE Paul The AM game was tragic My friend Tim and I went to watch it at a sports bar and needless to say I was the only Aggie fan in the crowd We had a chance to tie it or win it in the last two minutes We had driven the ball from our own yard line to about the CU yard line We had a first down and were going for it when we fumbled and they took it back for a touchdown The waitress felt sorry for me and bought us a shot of I dont even know what Im headed to Texas in a couple of weeks to see the Aggies Beat the Hell Outta Iowa State at Kyle Field I havent been to Kyle Field in ages so Im really looking forward to it Petrogulfs agreement indicates they have access to all major delivery points except Opal until the expansion is in place These other points would include QGM MGR OTTCO and QPL Its a bit curious to me that they would have QPL and OTTCO now since they have to go down the to get there Seems like these would be in the same boat with the Opal option so maybe this is not a true current option Cant Petrogulf tell you this stuff Its not my place to do it and the only reason I am is because youre going to drop a large sum of money taking me out to dinner kidding As for dinner yes Im still available As for the place dont feel like you need to drop a bunch of cash although cash is thrilling isnt it Im happy eating just about anything Im trying to be on a new health kick so healthy fare sounds appealing My only condition is that I cant stay out late because I have a am appointment at the gym with my trainer Thurs am Its brutal I leave the house at am Want to stay downtown or venture out kt Lucci Paul T To Karen L Taylor PaulTLucci cc enroncom Subject RE AM Hello Im back in the office today Well I see you have to eat crow I didnt get a chance to watch the game but I saw CU play Kansas St and CU looked good I even think CU has a good chance of beating UT in Austin this weekend As far as Petrogulf goes in the mean time before the great expansion do they have the right to go to Questar or any other interstate pipeline delivery points I think they can take their gas in kind at QuestarBird Canyon but Im not sure And finally are you still available for dinner Wednesday night I just got paid so Im looking to take you some place nice Yes I am bribing you Paul Original Message From Karen L Taylor mailto Sent Friday October PM To Subject Paul Once the expansion is completed in the next couple of months Petrogulf will have access to all delivery points off Jonah They currently dont have access to Opal I think thats all the super secret information I can divulge Hope you have a great weekend I have a small wager with Shari Wojta that the Fightin Texas Aggies will Beat the Hell Outta CU tomorrow Hope I
