districts filed a classaction lawsuit Tuesday against power companies charging they conspired to create an artificial power shortage to drive up the cost of electricity The suit was filed on behalf of the Valley Center Municipal Water District in North County Padre Dam Municipal Water District in Santee and Sweetwater Authority in South County and asked for million in overcharges the agencies say occurred between June and November However lawyers representing the agencies said that dollar figure could increase dramatically The power companies named in the suit included Enron Sempra which owns San Diego Gas Electric Co and Duke Energy Corp the Houstonbased energy giant that operates the South Bay power plant in Chula Vista Gary Arant the general manager of the Valley Center district said Tuesday that he expected more water agencies would join the lawsuit Valley Center is one of water agencies served by the San Diego County Water Authority At this point there are just three of us Arant said We would hope it would expand We made it perfectly clear that we were inviting others We have some interest But Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy Corp said Tuesday that the lawsuit is just a big waste of time and money There have been three independent investigations that have found no collusion or inappropriate market behavior by generators Williams said Generators have generally rebuffed claims of pricegouging pointing to a study by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that concluded that high demand low supplies and higher fuel costs were responsible for higher wholesale electricity prices last summer Dan McMillan the president of Padre Dam said each of the three agencies was being hurt badly by the increases in electrical rates which have doubled even tripled in some cases since Californias deregulation of the power industry took effect in June Arant said the Valley Center district alone estimates its increased power rates have cost it million between June and Nov Valley Center board members voted Monday night to pass on a portion of their electrical cost increases to their ratepayers McMillan said Padre Dam was expected to do the same Tuesday night Water pumping stations Arant said use a tremendous amount of electrical power In fact lastminute agreements by the California Department of Water Resources to shut down its pumping stations helped avert rolling blackouts across the state when California declared the first two Stage power alerts in its history Dec and Friday State officials declared Californias third Stage alert Tuesday Arant said the Valley Center districts electrical use runs to about five or six megawatts the same amount of electricity it would take to power to homes Yeah were one of SDGEs largest customers Arant said Attorney Mike Cowett of Best Best and Krieger the firm handling the classaction suit said while residential customers received some relief from soaring power rates when state legislators representing San Diego County demanded rate caps in September water agencies and other large commercial users have not You and I are exempt from the increases as residential users These water districts are paying the full freight and its hurting badly Cowett said Arant said a year ago that the Valley Center district was paying an average of cents per kilowatt hour for electricity a figure that has jumped to an average of cents per kilowatt hour since deregulation took effect Cowett said there is no way of telling how long it may take for the courts to act upon the suit As you know this is a huge complicated mess he said Cowett said there is a chance the agencies suit could be combined with other pending classaction suits filed against the power companies Cowett said the three agencies asked for treble damages which could drive up the suits million price tag to million However he said that the million figure only sought reimbursement for what the agencies felt they lost up until Nov and that the damages figure could also change to reflect ongoing losses Arant was diplomatic when asked if he felt the power companies made up the power crisis plaguing California We think there is cause to question whether or not all the cost we paid are just and reasonable he said However the suit filed Tuesday said the agencies believe the power companies purposely withheld electricity to create an artificial shortage Theres something wrong here Arant said Something terribly wrong Staff writers Yadira Galindo and Dan McSwain contributed to this report Contact staff writer Gig Conaughton at or Previous
