to update you on Texas Childrens Hospitals current status in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Allison Should you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me Texas Childrens Hospital has taken several steps to support three Texas Medical Center hospitals seriously damaged by the floods caused by Tropical Storm Allison Support to The Methodist Hospital Beginning today and continuing for the foreseeable future Texas Childrens will make two operating rooms available to surgeons from The Methodist Hospital for adult cardiovascular and liver transplant procedures In addition Texas Childrens will dedicate a bed unit to the adult Methodist patients for their followup intensive care and postoperative recovery The adult Methodist Hospital surgical procedures to be performed at Texas Childrens will be scheduled between pm and am to avoid conflicts with the normal Texas Childrens pediatric surgical schedules The Methodist surgeons will receive support in the Texas Childrens operating rooms from Methodist anesthesiolgists radiologists nurses blood bank and other Methodist allied health professionals Texas Childrens Hospital will provide additional support services to the Methodist adult patients including diagnostic imaging laboratory tests food and pharmacy services Texas Childrens will also provide a senior clinical administrator hours a day seven days a week to facilitate communications in meeting the needs of the Methodist physicians and nurses and their adult patients The number of adult surgeries that will be performed by the Methodist surgeons at Texas Childrens Hospital will be governed by the capacity of the bed Texas Childrens intensive care unit being made available This arrangement will continue until The Methodist Hospital is able to return its operating rooms and associated support facilities to service As it has done since the flood Texas Childrens will continue to accept adult bone marrow transplant patients from The Methodist Hospital based on Texas Childrens room and staff availabilty Support to St Lukes Episcopal Hospital Texas Childrens Hospital is in the process of working out details of an agreement by which Texas Childrens will make up to beds available to St Lukes Episcopal Hospital for general acute care of adult patients The adult St Lukes patients who will occupy these Texas Childrens beds will be under the care of St Lukes physicians nurses allied health and support services Texas Childrens will provide experienced clinical administrators to St Lukes hours a day seven days a week to assure seamless delivery of services to their adult patients This arrangement between Texas Childrens and St Lukes is anticipated to be operational sometime next week Support to Memorial Hermann Childrens Hospital Texas Childrens Hospital today hosted a meeting with executives from Memorial Hermann Childrens Hospital in which Texas Childrens offered Memorial Hermann up to neonatal level and general acute care beds Should Memorial Hermann accept this offer it would staff these beds with its own physicians and nurses while Texas Childrens would provide complete support services No decision has been made regarding this proposal Texas Childrens Hospital Flood Recovery Status Although Texas Childrens Hospital sustained an estimated million in damages and lost entirely one of its patient care buildings we were able to continue full operations with a percent patient census during the floods caused by Tropical Storm Allison Since then our inpatient census has remained near percent while our operating rooms outpatient specialty clinics and emergency center have functioned at their normal high rates of performance Meanwhile work continues to repair our damaged areas on the B basement level and to complete loss assessments to be able to file claims with our insurance carriers The Hospital carries a complete program of property equipment and business interruption insurance and expects to be adquately reimbursed for its losses Our Sincere Gratitude to The Texas Childrens Family On behalf of the Texas Childrens Hospital Board of Trustees may I once again express our deepest gratitude to everyone in the Texas Childrens Hospital Integrated Delivery System for your extraordinarily professional response to the threats posed by the floods of Tropical Storm Allison and their aftermath Most importantly our mission of providing the finest possible pediatric care to our young patients and their families continued uninterrupted during and after the floods In addition through your dedication and sacrifice we have been able to reach out to our neighbors in the Texas Medical Center to help them care for their patients as they struggle to recover from the terrible devastation they endured from the flood We are so very proud and honored to have you as members of the Texas Childrens family Again thank you very much Mark Mark A Wallace President Chief Executive Officer Texas Childrens Hospital
