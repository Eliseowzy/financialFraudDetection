BlairET NRON Larry BergerET NRON Kim PerezET NRON Karen LeslieET nron cc Subject Texas Chili I have it on good authority that this is a true story A True Texas Story These are notes from an inexperienced chili taster named FRANK who was visiting Texas from New Jersey Recently I was lucky enough to be the th attendee at the State Fair in Texas and was asked to fill in to be a judge at a chili cookoff Apparently the original Judge called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there when the call came in I was assured by the other two judges Native Texans that it would be a fun event and a true taste of Texas hospitality They assured me that the chili wouldnt be all that spicy and besides they told me I could have free beer during the tasting so I accepted Here are the scorecards from the event Chili Mikes Maniac Mobster Monster Chili JUDGE ONE A little too heavy on tomato Amusing kick JUDGE TWO Nice smooth tomato flavor Very mild FRANK Holy shit what the hell is this stuff You could remove dried paint from your driveway with it Took me two beers to put the flames out Hope thats the worst one These Texans are crazy Chili Arthurs Afterburner Chili JUDGE ONE Smoky with a hint of pork Slight Jalapeno tang JUDGE TWO Exciting BBQ flavor needs more peppers to be taken seriously FRANK Keep this out of reach of children Im not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver They had to walkietalkie in extra beers when they saw the look on my face Chili Freds Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili JUDGE ONE Excellent firehouse chili Great kick Needs more beans JUDGE TWO A beanless chili a bit saltygood use of red peppers FRANK Call the EPA Ive located a uranium spill My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano Everyone knows the routine by now Barmaid pounded me on the back now my backbone is in the front part of my chest Im getting shitfaced Chili Bubbas Black Magic JUDGE ONE Black bean chili with almost no spice Disappointing JUDGE TWO Hint of lime in the black beans Good side dish for fish or other mild foods not much of a chili FRANK I felt something scraping across my tongue but was unable to taste it Sally the bar maid was standing behind me with fresh refills that lb bitch is starting to look HOTjust like this nuclearwaste Im eating Chili Lindas Lethal Lip Remover JUDGE ONE Meaty strong chili Cayenne peppers freshly ground adding considerable kick Very impressive JUDGE TWO Chili using shredded beef could use more tomato Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement FRANK My ears are ringing and I can no longer focus my eyes I farted and four people behind me burst into flames The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming Screw those rednecks Chili Veras Very Vegetarian Variety JUDGE ONE Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili Good balance of spice and peppers JUDGE TWO The best yet Aggressive use of peppers onions and garlic Superb FRANK My intestines are now a straightpipe filled with gaseous sulfuric flames No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone Chili Susans Screaming Sensation Chili JUDGE ONE A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers JUDGE TWO Ho Hum tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment I should note that I am worried about Judge Number He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably FRANK You could put a grenade in my mouth pull the pin and I wouldnt feel a damn thing Ive lost the sight in one eye and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water My shirt is covered with chili that slid unnoticed out of my mouth My pants are full of lavalike shit to match my damn shirt At least during the autopsy theyll know what killed me Ive decided to stop breathing Its too painful Screw it Im not getting any anyway If I need air Ill just suck it in through the inch hole in my stomach Chili Helens Mount Saint Chili JUDGE ONE A perfect ending this is a nice blend chili safe for all not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence JUDGE TWO This final entry is a good balanced chili neither mild nor hot Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number passed out fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself Not sure if hes going to make it Poor Yank
