you on your trip Gay Randall L Sounds like you had a hectic time getting ready as always Im glad the trip seems to have worked out well Would like to hear all about it sometime when you have some time Gay Randall L I do apolegize for not getting back to you sooner Things have been very strange and busy here By now im sure you have heard about the dizzying collapse of Enron As of right now i am still employed but bankruptcy is probably on Monday Luckily the trading floor will probably be sold to an investment bank so we may continue just as before Will have to see how it works out And of course Thanksgiving was a very busy time visiting family and such Katy is doing wonderful She likes school and wants a dirt bike and a pony for Christmas I really am happy for yall and hope to see pictures of Jack soon Im sure Kathleen is smiling down on yall Take care and hope to hear from you soon at least sooner than i get back to you Randy and Katy From Frommelt BrianWBF To Randy Gay Subject Were Home Date Mon Nov XMailer Internet Mail Service Randy I dont know if you received the note below from my dad I must not have given him the pipelinecom address Anyway Im very sorry to be sending this news so late This month has been a blur On the afternoon of Oct th we received the call from our agency that our court date was set for Nov th and that we had to leave or Russia on Nov nd I was out of the office less than an hour after getting the call Ive been out of the office since then and Im just getting caught up on email now In those three and a half days we had to scramble to complete some last minute paper work for the region as well as to obtain plane reservations and Visasnot to mention getting packed As it was FedEx arrived with the visas just two hours before we left for the airport Our trip went smoothly and we returned on Nov th with our son Jack Oleg Frommelt Hes months old and doing great Sarah likes being an older sister except when he gets into her toys I had intended to send you a personal note when we received our court date but in the rush I just didnt get it donesorry Some of our extended family didnt even know until after we were in Russia I tried to call you the night before we left but the number I had didnt work do you have a new phone number or new area code We traveled to the city of Cheboksary It is on the Volga river roughly between Nizhniy Novgorod and Kazan Cheboksary is much less remote than Surgut Tracy was very concerned about being without bottled water again but it was not a problem We stayed with a host family and that was an nice experience However at virtually every point in the trip we thought back to February and our little group We also knew that Kathleen was with us every step of the way I dont have any digital pics to send yet but Ill try to do that soon I hope you and Katy had a wonderful Thanksgiving I wish we all lived closer to each other We look forward to talking to you sometime soon Love Brian Tracy Sarah Jack Subj Frommelt Adoption Date AM Central Standard Time From Jjfrommelt To Randy Brian asked me to email you and let you know that he and Tracy left this morning for Russia to pick up one year old Jack our wonderful new grandson He tried to call you but said he must have had the wrong number Jeff Frommelt Grandpa Original Message From Frommelt BrianWBF Sent Friday October PM To Randy Gay Subject RE Some good news Randy Thanks for your thoughts Im glad you mentioned Kathleen This whole process has been a stressful one and we have had our doubts from time to time I suppose that is not surprising given that it is a big decision and there were times in the past when we thought we would never go back Through it all we have felt that Kathleen was somehow with us and would help guide us to make the right decision I know her spirit will be with us when we make the trip too Sarah is doing great She is and a half going on This week she asked me to explain websites to her She loves Kindergarten and we make lots of trips too the library She played park district soccer for a few weeks but it wasnt her thing Shed rather climb and swing at the park or play with her friends Glad to hear the new job responsibilities are going well The trading has to be exciting Ill bet it can be exhausting too I hope you get some time to yourself to recharge your batteries By the way Enron field looks great even when the Astros are pounding my Cubbies It has been a difficult year at Motorola but the challenges also bring opportunity Tracy and I doing well We just celebrated our th wedding anniversaryWhere did the time go We dont know travel or court dates yet it could take several weeks Well keep you posted as soon as we have any news Take care Brian Original Message From Randy Gay mailto Sent Thursday October PM To Frommelt BrianWBF Subject Re Some good news Brian Tracy and Sarah that is fantastic news Katy and I are so happy for you Sounds like you have a wonderful journey ahead of you Again I hope this experience is as good if not better than the last Your news made me think about our time together also I know Kathleen would be and is im sure so happy for you The pictures we have of us all from Russia really show what a wonderful time we had together I treasure those memories as im sure you do How is Sarah Is she in kindergarten this year Katy is and loves it When shes not at school she is playing school She also loves books which i am very happy about She is having a very busy social season as well How are you two doing We always talk about the kids i hope you and Tracy are doing well I have been following all the news about Motorola in the last year and am sure you are doing well I have been trading gas in both the physical and futures markets and i love it I went through two of the three biggest stress inducing times of a persons life a new job is second and seem to have made it through ok Every day i seem to get a little stronger although i still miss Kathleen every day Please let me know how yall are doing I am really hoping your travels are good When do you think you will be going Is it another winter trip to Siberia If so dont forget to take all the essentials Write back when you can and let me know how you are doing Take care and God bless yall Randy and Katy At PM you wrote Randy and Katy We have some good news and we wanted you to be among the first to know Tracy and I have accepted a referral for a little boy in Russia He is in Cheboksary city on the Volga river about miles East of Moscow and will be year old on It took a great deal of thought and prayer At times we had serious doubts if it was the right path and wondered if we were crazy to go through this again but when we received a referralit just felt right We are using a different agency this time in part because Larissa was not accredited when we started the process Weve talked to Sarah about the adoption but we are not making a big deal about it with her until we get closer to traveling We dont have travel or court dates yet but we will definitely keep you posted The entire process has made us think back on the time we all had in Russia together and the experiences we shared All our best to you and Katy Brian
