Power Demand From Ind Users TOKYO NikkeiTerrorist attacks and the subsequent fall in US stock prices have diminished the confidence of Japanese businesses and investors who were already reeling from a global slowdown In an interview with The Nihon Keizai Shimbun Nobuya Minami president of Tokyo Electric Power Co said he is prepared to see power demand from largelot users weakening amid the slumping economy Excerpts follow Q How do you view the stock price plunge that has occurred in the aftermath of terrorist attacks in the US A Japanese stock prices were falling before the attacks suggesting that prices may have been inflated to begin with I think stock prices may fall further because its inevitable that companies will collapse as financial institutions expedite disposal of bad loans Q Whats your outlook on the economy and demand for electricity A Its still too early to assess the true economic impact of the terrorist attacks but it will be a considerable blow to the sluggish Japanese economy The socalled hollowing out of the Japanese manufacturing industry is likely to gather speed as more producers transfer their factories to China and other Asian countries Consumption of electricity was high this summer but volume customers are using less because industrial activities continue to slump I expect consumption among volume users will begin rising once the bad debt liquidation phase has passed Q Do you have concerns about rising oil prices given the situation in the Middle East A Japan depends less on oil now than we did in the s when there was a major oil crisis Our energy sources are more diverse and our oil reserve system is in good shape There may be price hikes but the impact will be much smaller this time Q Will Tokyo Electric reduce capital investment further A We decided last spring to keep our annual capital investment under billion yen on average for the next three years Thats about lower than our capital spending during peak times Well make further adjustments if necessary when we create a new capital investment plan next spring Q While most companies are struggling Tokyo Electric is expected to post its highest group net profit since it began reporting group earnings in fiscal There are increasing calls to lower electricity charges arent there A We plan to lower the charges in the medium to long term Q What do you say to the view that demand for electricity is unlikely to rise in the long term given rising environmental awareness among Japanese consumers A I think an increasing number of environmentally conscious people will cut consumption as they pursue a life thats less driven by consumption Electric companies have to develop new revenue sources such as energy conservation consulting Q In the US and Europe many utility companies handle both electricity and gas Do you think Japanese electric companies will do the same A As deregulation advances the boundaries between electricity gas and oil industries in Japan will probably become more blurred Tokyo Electric has to become a more comprehensive company that can deliver whatever energy the market demands The Nihon Keizai Shimbun Tuesday morning edition Issued September Power deregulation fails to connect New entrants impeded by high upfront costs some foreign firms prefer trading or other niches NATSUKO SEGAWA Staff writer Ennet Corp an independent power provider established by the NTT group and others operates this power plant which started up in July in Ibaraki Prefecture Some months after the partial deregulation of the electricity market new entrants are beginning to wonder if they really are facing free and fair competition for the potentially huge profits Meanwhile some foreign firms are utilizing their advantages such as expertise in powerrelated financial trading to carve out new niches unexplored by Japans traditionbound regional power utilities Since March when the government revised the Electricity Utilities Industry Law to allow free entry to the retail market for largelot users nine domestic companies have notified the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry of their plans to enter the market While not yet submitting such notifications at least three foreign firms Enron Japan Corp InterGen HK Ltd and El Paso Japan Co have started feasibility studies or negotiations with potential clients In spite of the sluggish economy the utility business appeared to be a promising field because of its huge potential Fullscale deregulation will give access to a market worth around trillion yen billion a year making Japan the worlds secondlargest electricity market Further the market keeps growing at a rate of a year So even when just of the market was opened there was a rush of new entrants But their expectations have been largely disappointed According to an estimate by the Trade Ministry new entrants have only a share of the market The difficulty in constructing new power plants high transmission costs and an uncertain deregulation schedule are slowing new participants expansion of business Enron which opened a Tokyo office in July last year is mounting an active challenge to Japans regulations and traditional business customs In May its local unit released proposals on electricity reform via the Internet which say that if the Japanese electricity market had introduced fair competition and reduced electricity costs to the level of the US largelot customers could have cut their electricity costs by around trillion yen a year Nicholas ODay vice president of Enron Japan does not try to hide his irritation at the slow progress of the deregulation process and indicates that strong government leadership is needed to enforce further reform Especially Enron and other new entrants want to see sharp reductions in the transmission fees charged to independent power providers by the utilities for access to their transmission lines Satoshi Abe senior analyst at Daiwa Institute of Research said Most clients in the deregulated market are industrial customers that already enjoy low electricity costs amounting to yen per kilowatthour The average generating cost is yen per kilowatthour and new entrants pay around yen per kilowatthour to utilities in transmission charges and other fees So theres no room for profit However Hiroshi Araki manager of corporate planning at Tokyo Electric Power Co Tepco argued We face the same cost when we use our own transmission lines so were competing on an equal footing with the new entrants Another disappointment for the new suppliers was the difficulty of obtaining additional electricity to sell As building a power plant requires an initial investment of at least billion yen most new entrants planned to buy excess electricity from manufacturers who have their own power generators and resell it But the plan soon ran into difficulties We could procure only of the electricity we needed and we were forced to revise our business model said Tsutomu Takeda vice president of Ennet Corp an independent power provider set up by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp group and others To secure supplies for its main customer the NTT group Ennet started operating a power plant in Ibaraki Prefecture in July and plans three more in Chiba and Kyoto prefectures by autumn For the foreign entrants the situation is even more severe as they have to build relationships with customers and find suitable sites to build power plants from scratch Earlier this year two US power companies El Paso and InterGen opened branches in Tokyo but they say they are just waiting and watching developments for now Stephen Del Regno president of El Paso Japan compared the situation here to that of South Korea which is also deregulating In South Korea land and labor costs are also very high but it is still more than cheaper to build a power plant there Keys Curry head representative at InterGen said The environmental impact assessment process is quite long in Japan So if you want to build a large power plant it takes at least six years Who can propose to clients to buy electricity that will be provided six years later Financial products Seeing these difficulties some foreign companies chose to start by offering financial products hedging risk and follow by trading electricity or futures contracts Enron is the forerunner in the field offering weather derivatives and other such products The local unit of a major US brokerage has staged experimental futures trading of electricity gathering around participants in March and May Both have power plants in the US but here they are leaving actual generation until later Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at intlasp
