hes famous too now Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNEs List of Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year Business Wire Copyright c Business Wire NEW YORKBUSINESS WIREOct LowerProfile Women Topple More Wellknown Names From Tech and Internet Sector Ranking Includes Newcomers Though HewlettPackard lost billion in market value in a year CEO Carly Fiorina hasnt lost her nerve and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No position on FORTUNEs ranking of the Most Powerful Women in Business The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October issue of FORTUNE available on newsstands October and at wwwfortunecom at pm on October In the No spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman who runs an Internet company that actually makes money million in the last four quarters on million in revenue Oprah Winfrey the Queen of Media is mightier than ever and holds the No spot up from No last year She produces movies brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers propels books to bestsellerdom and last year teamed up with Hearst Magazines Cathie Black No on the list to publish O The Oprah Magazineby some measures the most successful magazine startup ever At No is Andrea Jung Chairman and CEO of Avon who has breathed life into ailing Avon Mirant CEO Marce Fullerthe only newcomer in the top fiveholds the No position Inside a stodgy utility Southern Fuller built a highgrowth trading and marketing unit which was spun off in April In these new more tempered times patience may be about to reap its reward In FORTUNEs annual survey of the Most Powerful Women in Business there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in Patient But Not Passive the story that accompanies the list By patience we mean staying with a company steadily building influence there and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge not promises and selfpromotion Fiorina who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNEs inaugural list in heads the biggest company billion in revenues last year run by a woman And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever Wall Street practically heckled her latest movea bold bet to buy Compaqbut Fiorina remains defiant In difficult times people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny she says As always the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time Last year power resided in the technology and Internet sectors but that influence was fleeting Gone from the list this year Deborah Hurricane Debby Hopkins who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May Ellen Hancock who failed at the startup Exodus and Morgan Stanleys Mary Meeker who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz But one Web warrior looks better than ever Meg Whitman No on the list She has never overpromised to investors instead she has diligently delivered abovetarget profits every single quarter Fourteen newcomers join the list this year Marce Fuller President CEO Mirant Louise Kitchen COO Enron Americas Colleen Barrett President COO Southwest Airlines Betsy Bernard President CEO ATT Consumer Anne Stevens VP North America Vehicle Operations Ford Motor Maria Elena

EVP Retail Operations Safeway and Louise Francesconi VP and GM Missile Systems Raytheon While the economy and its points of power change the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same Says Sellers We consider the size and importance of a womans business in the global economy her clout inside her company and the arc of her careerwhere she has been and where she is likely to go When appropriate we also weigh the womans influence on mass culture and society That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No on this years list The shifts on our list this year are dramatic with newcomers But one trend is especially intriguing Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever A few years ago responsibility for a billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list No more This years FORTUNE includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of billion or more which is a first In a related story It Took a Lady To Save Avon Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung Chairman and CEO of Avon Says Brooker Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them And thats what has made her one of the most successful CEOsmale or femalein recent years Over the past months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business how it advertises manufactures packages and even sells its products and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady but by reviving her The result growth in revenues operating profits and operating margins In addition FORTUNE includes an international list of the powerful women in business The top ten featured in the magazine are Marjorie Scardino CEO Pearson Britain Anne Lauvergeon Chairman Areva France Mary Ma Senior VP CFO Legend Hong Kong Marianne Nivert President CEO Telia Sweden Lien
