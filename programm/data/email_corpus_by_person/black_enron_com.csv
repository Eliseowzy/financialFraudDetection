Marketing Media Harrahs Signs Pact With Enron in Bid To Cut Energy Costs By Christina Binkley The Wall Street Journal B Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Harrahs Entertainment Inc signed a sevenyear energymanagement agreement with Enron Corp that is expected to cut the casino companys electricity and naturalgas costs by million a year Higher energy costs in Las Vegas have become a bogeyman to casino investors of late as Nevadas electricity prices have soared in the past year They are expected to rise a further in the coming year A number of analysts have warned that the higher prices threaten expected profits among major casino operators A real severe threat of erosion in profits from energy costs led Harrahs to sign the agreement with Enrons Enron Energy Services unit said Gary Loveman Harrahs president and chief operating officer in an interview There was an unbudgeted and uncontrollable effect on profitability The agreement which the companies plan to announce today is expected to lead to savings that will add roughly a penny to Harrahs annual earnings per share A consensus of analysts estimates calls for earnings of a share according to Thomson FinancialFirst Call The energy agreement applies to Harrahs casinos in seven states Although other hotel companies have signed similar agreements with Enron Harrahs is the first gambling one to do so The savings estimate of million is based on an assumption that outside the agreement electricity and naturalgas prices will rise moderately during the next seven years Harrahs now spends about million a year on electricity and natural gas The risk for Harrahs is that the past years energyprice trends reverse themselves In that case Harrahs wouldnt receive the benefit of the lower prices Were buying a hedge Its an insurance policy said Mr Loveman At a minimum it allows us to budget As part of the deal Enron will also advise Harrahs on energy conservation from installing new boilers to adding new lighting systems Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron ComEd For Power Deals Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc CHICAGO Dow Jones The City of Chicago and suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for megawatts of power between Enron Corp ENE and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co Chicago officials said Wednesday In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in the local government groups will get of their power from Enron and from Exelon Corps EXC ComEd The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois Chicago Mayor Richard M Daley said at a press conference The government coalition sent out a request for proposals to the states registered electricity providers last summer requesting bids for cheaper power and also for power thats generated with renewable supplies Combined the municipalities currently pay ComEd about million a year for megawatts of power most of which comes from nuclear and coalfired power plants Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing megawatts of power created with landfill gas wind and other sources ComEd will also provide the coalition with another megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants and Enron will provide the other megawatts The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year Terms of the power deals werent announced as about accounts between municipal agencies and the two power providers must still be ironed out city officials said But the government groups do have a target for savings Chicago which uses about megawatts and pays ComEd about million annually for power expects to save a net million a year through a combination of cheaper power from Enron and more expensive renewable power from ComEd Once all the accounting is completed its likely the municipal groups will save up to million in total each year the city estimates Enron gave us the most competitive price Daley said ComEd officials didnt calculate how much the new deals with the municipal groups will be worth now that the utility is positioned to lose contracts for about megawatts of power Spokesman Bob Dwyer said though losing the bid to supply the groups doesnt mean megawatts will go unused Instead the risk management arm of ComEds parent company Exelon can now deal that power to other companies on the wholesale market Exelon is looking to see what we can do on the wholesale market Dwyer said The market will tell us what can be done there Exelon owns ComEds former Illinois nuclear plants and supplies power to the utility through longterm contracts The plants which combined produce about megawatts were transferred after ComEd merged with Philadelphias PECO Energy to form Exelon last year ComEd plans to start supplying megawatts of renewable power to the municipal groups this year by purchasing supplies from companies developing landfill gas recovery projects near Chicago The additional megawatts of renewable power will be supplied within five years when wind generators and other projects are expected to be added in the state In addition to creating cleaner air and saving money the new power deals are also designed to spur competition in Illinois new retail electricity markets said Bill Abolt commissioner of Chicagos Department of Environment Illinois is gradually spreading competition to different customer classes with all residential customers becoming eligible to choose their supplier next year The marketplace has to be built Abolt said By Jon Kamp Dow Jones
