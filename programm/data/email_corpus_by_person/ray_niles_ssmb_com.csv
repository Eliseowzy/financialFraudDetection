OUR TAKEAWAYS Power prices are declining in California as the destruction of demand effect of higher retail power prices kicks in The longterm power contracts signed by the various Power Producers and Energy Merchants are looking like sweetheart deals for them as evidence of price weakness from a base of extremely high prices is beginning to develop The movement in prices in California is reflective of the message in our Power Curve report where we show that forward prices are peaking this summer Yearyear power price comparisons are now projected to be flat Q and declining afterwards POWER POINTSGreat News LongTerm Contracts Jeopardized By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesThose looking for even the slightest bit of good news for the state of California can find it in Fridays San Jose Mercury News California is in danger of losing more than of the power it has lined up in longterm contracts says the lead of a major article because Republicans in the state legislature didnt back the billion bond deal last week Getting out of most of those contracts would be the best thing to happen to California in a long time Since the state went on its longterm buying binge forward prices for power in the western US have been falling steadily Gov Gray Davis announced billion in purchases lasting up to years on March Contracts for summer power at Palo Verde Ariz a key western trading hub that feeds a lot of power into California have fallen to a megawatthour from a high of MWh in late March Further out power for at midColumbia River a key trading hub north of California has fallen from MWh in February to MWh today Companies like Calpine Corp CPN and Dynegy DYN that took advantage of the states buying binge are looking pretty fat and happy In fact they have affectionately started calling the governor Gravy Days Enron Corp ENE which has been selling aggressively for two months according to traders is looking like a genius as usual Generators that held out like Reliant Energy REI and Duke Energy DUK may be sorry that they did Its been a long time since those long on western power have felt serious pain in the markets but that time has come Power generators may not make as much profit this summer as last and power traders that have taken long speculative positions may liquidate supplies for far less than they bought them As was seen in the eastern US power markets last summer long positions can turn out just as painful as short positions For California the good news is that maybe spot purchasing costs this summer wont be as bad as once expected The bad news is that the state government is by far the biggest long in the bearish forward market Its safe to say that the billion in contracts signed in March have declined in value by or billion Thats almost as big of a financial disaster going forward as everything that has gone on since last summer until now Granted this is a sort of damnedifyoudodamnedifyoudont situation Barring the utilities from the forward market during the first three years of deregulation was one of the most expensive public policy mistakes in US history California should do some forward purchasing now and its such a behemoth that it will move the market up when it does so And when it gets done buying prices will come down simply because it stopped But thats a footnote to the mismanagement of the financial side of the energy crisis Early this year when the state started down the path of megapurchasing there was no shortage of advice not to do so Longterm prices were embedded with too much of todays supplydemand imbalance The state would have been much better off dealing with the imbalance first since it would have to do that anyway and gradually securing forward power as declining prices reflected the improving situation Since then the state has done a great job of crushing demand Electric usage is already down from where it was expected to be thanks to a conservation efforts and a slowing economy and people havent even seen their higher bills yet Similar reduction has been seen in power consumption in other western states and in natural gas usage nationally This is likely what has been behind much of the downturn in forward power prices in the West This column started with a false good news lead It would be great for the state if after the states credit rating sinks further sellers exercised their option to tear up the five and tenyear contracts But they wont do that The prices are too good from the sellers perspective Calpine which has signed three such contracts for the state said immediately that it has no intention of reneging on its agreements And Gary Ackerman director of the sellers association told the Mercury News that he didnt expect power companies in general to back out of the deals But there may be some real good news for California The Davis administration hired dozens of people that have little or no experience in energy trading to purchase billions of dollars of power Perhaps they are quick learners This week presented an excellent opportunity for the state to pick up what it needs summer power for this year only on sale Low prices in the daily market Monday and Tuesday drove the summer contract prices down to MWh which is cheap by recent standards The contract price moved up to MWh but the state took advantage of the opportunity while the window was open The weeks condition in the market place helped We were able to procure some energy for June through September said state spokesman Oscar Hidalgo And hey there were no blackouts this week By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires GMTAPDJ GMT Raymond C Niles PowerNatural Gas Research Salomon Smith Barney s
