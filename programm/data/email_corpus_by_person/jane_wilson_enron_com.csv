Ministers has not approved any specific draft They deliberated on various concepts which approved concepts have been incorporated into the NCAER Draft VII It is our understanding that just prior to his hospitalization the late Minister instructed his Ministry to support the NCAER draft The Prime Minister has assumed the role of Minister of Power until a successor to Mr Kumaramangalam has been appointed Im sure you are aware of the dynamic role the Prime Ministers Office PMO has played in the telecommunications reform in India The same kind of dynamic role should be played by the PMO in power reforms Mr NK Singh is the Secretary to the Minister and was the person who actively worked on the telecommunication reforms If the Secretary of Energy has an opportunity to indicate to Mr Singh and certainly the Prime Minister if possible the need for the Prime Ministers Office to become active in promoting power reforms and the advisability and need to support Draft VII of the Electricity Bill it would be most helpful Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Jane Wilson PM To cc Sanjay BhatnagarENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Ashok MehtaENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Stephen D NRON Joe NRON Steven J nron Mark CT Neil McGregorENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Electricity Bill Developments Dear David Im so glad you asked for an update We have indeed had an interesting development regarding the Electricity Bill since your visit You will recall that in AMCHAMs briefing it was positively noted that the drafting process of the Electricity Bill had been transparent and that a draft that would provide a blueprint for the restructuring of the electricity sector to move toward competitive markets was attained Noone was percent satisfied probably the mark of a good passable bill but many agreed to the draft and felt while not perfect it would achieve the desired reform We have learned that there are actually two drafts of the Electricity Bill sponsored by the Ministry of Power The first has been developed by NCAER NCAER draft in a very transparent process with seven iterations and comments from parties NCAER was hired as a consultant for this purpose by the Ministry of Power At the time of Draft III a second draft MoP draft was developed in the Ministry which subsequently incorporated some but not all of the NCAER draft provisions negotiated in the transparent process It was the MoP draft that was sent to the Group of Ministers and has been worked on by the Ministry of Law The draft however was never introduced in Parliament The industry discovered the existence of the second MoP draft immediately prior to Minister Kumaramangalams hospitalization and lobbied him and Secretary Basu heavily to introduce the NCAER draft in Parliament or at a minimum allow a transparent commenting process on the MoP draft Several parties in the industry have now been given the MoP draft and Secretary Basu has said he would entertain comments How widely it has been distributed is unknown In addition the death of the Minister who was a staunch advocate of reform and the lack of a named successor has now left things somewhat uncertain The issues as they now stand are The existence of two separate Ministrysponsored drafts only one of which was subjected to a wide sector review process The need to use the product of a transparent commenting process once it has been formulated The fact that the finetuned balance of interests and clear blueprint for a transition to competitive markets achieved by the NCAER draft has been lost in the MoP draft For example the clear deregulation of price provisions in the tariff section have been removed so that there is in the MoP draft full regulation of price by the state commissions however in the state commission section there is a provision that allows the State Commission to permit access to a consumer class and only determine the wheeling charge rather than the wheeling and supply price for that class when it has so determined Thus there is an apparent conflict within the statute regarding the regulation of commodity priceand uncertainty regarding access to end users There are many such examples Action Item Either support the NCAER draft and send it to the Ministry of Law for legal fine tuning Basu mentioned that the form of the NCAER draft was not right or repeat the iterative transparent commenting process with regard to the MoP draft hWe recommend supporting the NCAER draft because it reflects a balance of the multiple sector interests It is the first such document produced through an open process in India and was a process sponsored by the Ministry for that reason alone the Ministry should promote and support the NCAER version Any assistance you can render on this issue will be greatly appreciated by many parties in the sector Let us know how it goes Sincerely Jane Wilson Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Pumphrey David on AM To cc Cutler

Wilson PM To Mark CT cc Subject Mega power status There may be no advantages for us in this megaproject status other than the privilege of becoming fully regulated However the Ministry is considering us and Ken Lay made big announcements to the press After these announcements I pulled a team together on Dabhol strategy The conclusion was that now that weve made our application and annoucement noone asked me See below we must keep up the pretext of appearing to seek the mega project status to look like we are trying to help MSEB The consensus of the group was that probably the whole idea of megaproject status will bite the dust Unbenownst to me a number of letters were filed with the Ministry with MSEB and with CERC requesting mega power project status A letter was filed with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission CERC requesting that CERC use its good offices to obtain this status for Dabhol In a public forum a panel that I moderated at a conference Dr Rao referenced this letter as one filed by a multinational corporation that wouldnt have filed it in its own country improperly asking for the use of influence When he sat back down next to me Dr Rao leaned over and whispered that it was Enron that the name was Sandeep Kohli and that he was certain I didnt know about it I subsequently formally requested its withdrawal much to Raos relief This was Sanjays idea PS its hot in Mumbai now about degrees or so in the daytime Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Jane Wilson AM To Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Mega power status Here is the hand out on mega power project that I handed out in our strategy meeting in January Please note that in the Monday January Business Standard it was reported that the next tranche of mega power projects may get no tax benefits The Union power ministry may not offer tax sops to the projects presently under consideration for mega power project status Official sources confirmed that the new projects would not be offered benefits like customs duties waiver offered to the mega projects cleared last year The only benefit these projects are expected to receive is sale to the Power Trading Corporation PTC whereby the state risk on independent power producers IPPs is transferred to PTC Such sops do not have a major impact on the projects tariff as was initially calculated The power ministry is considereing a proposla to accord mega status to eight projects including the Dabhol venture in Maharashtra Sources however said mega project status would onl be granted on the basis of the tariff quoted by the projects under consideration The Union power ministry has already formed a committee which will analyse the tariffs for these projects so as to accord them the status They said that the committee would be examining the tariffs in accordance to similar project cleared by the Central Electricity Authority Mega power projects are large interstate power venture selling power to more than one state through the Power Trading Corporation The projects that have been notified as mega power projects get special benefits in terms of the customs duty waiver and will enable te government to obtain competitive tariffs from projects These project also get deemed export status wherein domestic equipment suppliers will be entititled to duty drawback and refund of terminal excise duty I now have the Availability Based Tariff Order issued prior to my being involved in India and will analyze it This order will apply to mega power projects as you see in the handout I want to do a full regulatory analysis for us in the next month Please let me know what our current strategic thinking is on the mega project issue I still think that this would not be to Enrons advantage However being realistic something will have to change I just dont think submitting ourselves to regulation by the CERC with one buyer the PTC is to our advantage anyway With potentially no tax advantages what are we thinking However as we discussed in the meeting we must continue the pretext What happens if the dog catches the car On a separte subject I know you are busy with the refocus of our development efforts but obviously I would like to spend some time with you with regard to my reassignment to the India region only at my suggestion by the way Since Im returning to the US on Thursday night the th

model Perhaps if you sent Akshay and me the model that is being used to work the answers to Jims questions one model or two we can see what were working with currently Please note the following Merit Order Dispatch in the Next Rate CaseAttached below is what my team Robert Neustaedter has drafted for the rate case filing on merit order dispatch There is a mistake on page regarding the percentage TOP that needs to pass outside merit order dispatch its rather than Further weve asked Ramu to Indianize the text before we pass it back to Mr Palumvar Merit order dispatch has not been clearly treated by the MERC or any other Commission other than the Gujarat ERC and this filing should serve as a foundation for this rate case and others Merit Order Dispatch Cap The May order treats two concepts as one the least cost purchase policy that determines what power purchase costs are included in the rates for the rate case period is equated with merit order dispatch which is a daytoday operational tool that determines actual purchases The rate case order of May as written did not cap the quantities What the rate case stated and I am not quoting was that quantities in addition to those authorized could be dispatched so long as the average realisation exceeded the cost I would also argue that the India obligation to serve customers provides additional grounds for further dispatch quantities The catch is in two places first whether dispatch of DPC power meets the test Shubh told me recently it did does this continue to hold true Mohan and second the recovery of the

does not allow a carryover of these volumes from one rate case to the next Typically the variance is just included in the next rate case This practice actually provides a utility with an opportunity

has advised Enron that MERC has no jurisdiction over the PPA and cannot establish regulations on things like merit order dispatch much less set the merit order dispatch A written legal opinion has been requested The thought of the Linklaters attorneys both Sandeep Katwala and Chris Walker and tentatively Wade is that the MERC may be DPCs worst enemy if it has jurisdiction over the renegotiated PPA which it will and must approve it thus it may be better to take the offensive and challenge its jurisdiction over merit order dispatch The strategy isnt fully formed yet but I wonder about the wisdom of i taking on a regulator that could be in a position to approve a renegotiated PPA and ii how a jurisdictional challenge to a regulator attempting to restructure squares with Enrons positionsreputation worldwide Ill be discussing this with all parties when I get back to work after New Years and will let you know as this issue progresses Enron is as I speak seriously contemplating pulling the letters of credit Weve been told by the Chairman of MSEB that he has some money but he is not going to pay Octobers bill for DPC According to him DPC was forced on MSEB by the Govt of

course we cannot do analysis out of the context of the model Perhaps if you sent Akshay and me the model that is being used to work the answers to Jims questions one model or two we can see what were working with currently Please note the following Merit Order Dispatch in the Next Rate CaseAttached below is what my team Robert Neustaedter has drafted for the rate case filing on merit order dispatch There is a mistake on page regarding the percentage TOP that needs to pass outside merit order dispatch its rather than Further weve asked Ramu to Indianize the text before we pass it back to Mr Palumvar Merit order dispatch has not been clearly treated by the MERC or any other Commission other than the Gujarat ERC and this filing should serve as a foundation for this rate case and others Merit Order Dispatch Cap The May order treats two concepts as one the least cost purchase policy that determines what power purchase costs are included in the rates for the rate case period is equated with merit order dispatch which is a daytoday operational tool that determines actual purchases The rate case order of May as written did not cap the quantities What the rate case stated and I am not quoting was that quantities in addition to those authorized could be dispatched so long as the average realisation exceeded the cost I would also argue that the India obligation to serve customers provides additional grounds for further dispatch quantities The catch is in two places first whether dispatch of DPC power meets the test Shubh told me recently it did does this continue to hold true Mohan and second the recovery of the power purchase costs due to the variance the difference between what is authorized in the order and what is actually dispatched Recovery of Variance According to

Ministers has not approved any specific draft They deliberated on various concepts which approved concepts have been incorporated into the NCAER Draft VII It is our understanding that just prior to his hospitalization the late Minister instructed his Ministry to support the NCAER draft The Prime Minister has assumed the role of Minister of Power until a successor to Mr Kumaramangalam has been appointed Im sure you are aware of the dynamic role the Prime Ministers Office PMO has played in the telecommunications reform in India The same kind of dynamic role should be played by the PMO in power reforms Mr NK Singh is the Secretary to the Minister and was the person who actively worked on the telecommunication reforms If the Secretary of Energy has an opportunity to indicate to Mr Singh and certainly the Prime Minister if possible the need for the Prime Ministers Office to become active in promoting power reforms and the advisability and need to support Draft VII of the Electricity Bill it would be most helpful Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Jane Wilson PM To cc Sanjay BhatnagarENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Ashok MehtaENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Stephen D NRON Joe NRON Steven J nron Mark CT Neil McGregorENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Electricity Bill Developments Dear David Im so glad you asked for an update We have indeed had an interesting development regarding the Electricity Bill since your visit You will recall that in AMCHAMs briefing it was positively noted that the drafting process of the Electricity Bill had been transparent and that a draft that would provide a blueprint for the restructuring of the electricity sector to move toward competitive markets was attained Noone was percent satisfied probably the mark of a good passable bill but many agreed to the draft and felt while not perfect it would achieve the desired reform We have learned that there are actually two drafts of the Electricity Bill sponsored by the Ministry of Power The first has been developed by NCAER NCAER draft in a very transparent process with seven iterations and comments from parties NCAER was hired as a consultant for this purpose by the Ministry of Power At the time of Draft III a second draft MoP draft was developed in the Ministry which subsequently incorporated some but not all of the NCAER draft provisions negotiated in the transparent process It was the MoP draft that was sent to the Group of Ministers and has been worked on by the Ministry of Law The draft however was never introduced in Parliament The industry discovered the existence of the second MoP draft immediately prior to Minister Kumaramangalams hospitalization and lobbied him and Secretary Basu heavily to introduce the NCAER draft in Parliament or at a minimum allow a transparent commenting process on the MoP draft Several parties in the industry have now been given the MoP draft and Secretary Basu has said he would entertain comments How widely it has been distributed is unknown In addition the death of the Minister who was a staunch advocate of reform and the lack of a named successor has now left things somewhat uncertain The issues as they now stand are The existence of two separate Ministrysponsored drafts only one of which was subjected to a wide sector review process The need to use the product of a transparent commenting process once it has been formulated The fact that the finetuned balance of interests and clear blueprint for a transition to competitive markets achieved by the NCAER draft has been lost in the MoP draft For example the clear deregulation of price provisions in the tariff section have been removed so that there is in the MoP draft full regulation of price by the state commissions however in the state commission section there is a provision that allows the State Commission to permit access to a consumer class and only determine the wheeling charge rather than the wheeling and supply price for that class when it has so determined Thus there is an apparent conflict within the statute regarding the regulation of commodity priceand uncertainty regarding access to end users There are many such examples Action Item Either support the NCAER draft and send it to the Ministry of Law for legal fine tuning Basu mentioned that the form of the NCAER draft was not right or repeat the iterative transparent commenting process with regard to the MoP draft hWe recommend supporting the NCAER draft because it reflects a balance of the multiple sector interests It is the first such document produced through an open process in India and was a process sponsored by the Ministry for that reason alone the Ministry should promote and support the NCAER version Any assistance you can render on this issue will be greatly appreciated by many parties in the sector Let us know how it goes Sincerely Jane Wilson Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Pumphrey David on AM To cc Cutler

Wilson PM To Mark CT cc Subject Mega power status There may be no advantages for us in this megaproject status other than the privilege of becoming fully regulated However the Ministry is considering us and Ken Lay made big announcements to the press After these announcements I pulled a team together on Dabhol strategy The conclusion was that now that weve made our application and annoucement noone asked me See below we must keep up the pretext of appearing to seek the mega project status to look like we are trying to help MSEB The consensus of the group was that probably the whole idea of megaproject status will bite the dust Unbenownst to me a number of letters were filed with the Ministry with MSEB and with CERC requesting mega power project status A letter was filed with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission CERC requesting that CERC use its good offices to obtain this status for Dabhol In a public forum a panel that I moderated at a conference Dr Rao referenced this letter as one filed by a multinational corporation that wouldnt have filed it in its own country improperly asking for the use of influence When he sat back down next to me Dr Rao leaned over and whispered that it was Enron that the name was Sandeep Kohli and that he was certain I didnt know about it I subsequently formally requested its withdrawal much to Raos relief This was Sanjays idea PS its hot in Mumbai now about degrees or so in the daytime Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Jane Wilson AM To Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Mega power status Here is the hand out on mega power project that I handed out in our strategy meeting in January Please note that in the Monday January Business Standard it was reported that the next tranche of mega power projects may get no tax benefits The Union power ministry may not offer tax sops to the projects presently under consideration for mega power project status Official sources confirmed that the new projects would not be offered benefits like customs duties waiver offered to the mega projects cleared last year The only benefit these projects are expected to receive is sale to the Power Trading Corporation PTC whereby the state risk on independent power producers IPPs is transferred to PTC Such sops do not have a major impact on the projects tariff as was initially calculated The power ministry is considereing a proposla to accord mega status to eight projects including the Dabhol venture in Maharashtra Sources however said mega project status would onl be granted on the basis of the tariff quoted by the projects under consideration The Union power ministry has already formed a committee which will analyse the tariffs for these projects so as to accord them the status They said that the committee would be examining the tariffs in accordance to similar project cleared by the Central Electricity Authority Mega power projects are large interstate power venture selling power to more than one state through the Power Trading Corporation The projects that have been notified as mega power projects get special benefits in terms of the customs duty waiver and will enable te government to obtain competitive tariffs from projects These project also get deemed export status wherein domestic equipment suppliers will be entititled to duty drawback and refund of terminal excise duty I now have the Availability Based Tariff Order issued prior to my being involved in India and will analyze it This order will apply to mega power projects as you see in the handout I want to do a full regulatory analysis for us in the next month Please let me know what our current strategic thinking is on the mega project issue I still think that this would not be to Enrons advantage However being realistic something will have to change I just dont think submitting ourselves to regulation by the CERC with one buyer the PTC is to our advantage anyway With potentially no tax advantages what are we thinking However as we discussed in the meeting we must continue the pretext What happens if the dog catches the car On a separte subject I know you are busy with the refocus of our development

operational tool that determines actual purchases The rate case order of May as written did not cap the quantities What the rate case stated and I am not quoting was that quantities in addition to those authorized could be dispatched so long as the average realisation exceeded the cost I would also argue that the India obligation to serve customers provides additional grounds for further

does not allow a carryover of these volumes from one rate case to the next Typically the variance is just included in the next rate case This practice actually provides a utility with an opportunity to overrecover costs for a period of time which is why the goal of a rate case is normally to understate demand We have approached the MSEB rate case however with a different perspective in an attempt to get the revenues up to allow more funds for MSEB to pay its bills As provided in the Act the variance must either be subsidised by the State or absorbed by the SEB This is a major financial problem

have assumed loss figures which is assuming little or no improvement since this is the worst case scenario Your assumptions on Rs devaluation are also aggressive as they need to be for a pessimistic scenario You have assumed that MSEBs average realization per unit in terms actually goes down due to Rs devaluation There are some areas where Jane can shed more light MSEB can increase its average realization simply by limiting supply to agri customers and by not giving any new unmetered connections The latter is something that has been decreed by MERC Jane please correct me if I am wrong while the former was the most likely cause for Bhaves exit Jane Can you with Akshayas help take a crack at what the agricultural load and unmetered customers are likely to be in the years through Similarly what is the likely growth in the metered cutomer categories Also if Dabhol were to be despatched to the load center at Mumbai following Mohans conclusion of PLF on MW and the plants close to Chandrapur were to despatch less what would be the overall TD loss picture The question to answer here is what portion of the is theft and what is actual TD loss My understanding is that betwen is actual TD loss due to the poor state of the network Further we will have to ask the question whether the actual TD loss is more due to distribution or due to transmission My gut feel is that it is due

justice has advised Enron that MERC has no jurisdiction over the PPA and cannot establish regulations on things like merit order dispatch much less set the merit order dispatch A written legal opinion has been requested The thought of the Linklaters attorneys both Sandeep Katwala and Chris Walker and tentatively Wade is that the MERC may be DPCs worst enemy if it has jurisdiction over the renegotiated PPA which it will and must approve it thus it may be better to take the offensive and challenge its jurisdiction over merit order dispatch The strategy isnt fully formed yet but I wonder about the wisdom of i taking on a regulator that could be in a position to approve a renegotiated PPA and ii how a jurisdictional challenge to a regulator attempting to restructure squares with Enrons positionsreputation worldwide Ill be discussing this with all parties when I get back to work after New Years and will let you know as this issue progresses Enron is as I speak seriously contemplating pulling the letters of credit Weve been told by the Chairman of MSEB that he has some money but he is not going to pay Octobers bill for DPC According to him DPC was forced on MSEB by the Govt of

Wilson PM To Mark CT cc Subject Mega power status There may be no advantages for us in this megaproject status other than the privilege of becoming fully regulated However the Ministry is considering us and Ken Lay made big announcements to the press After these announcements I pulled a team together on Dabhol strategy The conclusion was that now that weve made our application and annoucement noone asked me See below we must keep up the pretext of appearing to seek the mega project status to look like we are trying to help MSEB The consensus of the group was that probably the whole idea of megaproject status will bite the dust Unbenownst to me a number of letters were filed with the Ministry with MSEB and with CERC requesting mega power project status A letter was filed with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission CERC requesting that CERC use its good offices to obtain this status for Dabhol In a public forum a panel that I moderated at a conference Dr Rao referenced this letter as one filed by a multinational corporation that wouldnt have filed it in its own country improperly asking for the use of influence When he sat back down next to me Dr Rao leaned over and whispered that it was Enron that the name was Sandeep Kohli and that he was certain I didnt know about it I subsequently formally requested its withdrawal much to Raos relief This was Sanjays idea PS its hot in Mumbai now about degrees or so in the daytime Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Jane Wilson AM To Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Mega power status Here is the hand out on mega power project that I handed out in our strategy meeting in January Please note that in the Monday January Business Standard it was reported that the next tranche of mega power projects may get no tax benefits The Union power ministry may not offer tax sops to the projects presently under consideration for mega power project status Official sources confirmed that the new projects would not be offered benefits like customs duties waiver offered to the mega projects cleared last year The only benefit these projects are expected to receive is sale to the Power Trading Corporation PTC whereby the state risk on independent power producers IPPs is transferred to PTC Such sops do not have a major impact on the projects tariff as was initially calculated The power ministry is considereing a proposla to accord mega status to eight projects including the Dabhol venture in Maharashtra Sources however said mega project status would onl be granted on the basis of the tariff

committee would be examining the tariffs in accordance to similar project cleared by the Central Electricity Authority Mega power projects are large interstate power venture selling power to more than one state through the Power Trading Corporation The projects that have been notified as mega power projects get special benefits in terms of the customs duty waiver and will enable te government to obtain competitive tariffs from projects These project also get deemed export status wherein domestic equipment suppliers will be entititled to duty drawback and refund of terminal excise duty I now have the Availability Based Tariff Order issued prior to my being involved in India and will analyze it This order will apply to mega power projects as you see in the handout I want to do a full regulatory analysis for us in the next month Please let me know what our current strategic thinking is on the mega project issue I still think that this would not be to Enrons advantage However being realistic something will have to change I just dont think submitting ourselves to regulation by the CERC with one buyer the PTC is to our advantage anyway With potentially no tax advantages what are

justice has advised Enron that MERC has no jurisdiction over the PPA and cannot establish regulations on things like merit order dispatch much less set the merit order dispatch A written legal opinion has been requested The thought of the Linklaters attorneys both Sandeep Katwala and Chris Walker and tentatively Wade is that the MERC may be DPCs worst enemy if it has jurisdiction over the renegotiated PPA which it will and must approve it thus it may be better to take the offensive and challenge its jurisdiction over merit order dispatch The strategy isnt fully formed yet but I wonder about the wisdom of i taking on a regulator that could be in a position to approve a renegotiated PPA and ii how a jurisdictional challenge to a regulator attempting to restructure squares with Enrons positionsreputation worldwide Ill be discussing this with all parties when I get back to work after New Years and will let you know as this issue progresses Enron is as I speak seriously contemplating pulling the letters of credit Weve been told by the Chairman of MSEB that he has some money but he is not going to pay Octobers bill for DPC According to him DPC was forced on MSEB by the Govt of

Mr Palumvar Merit order dispatch has not been clearly treated by the MERC or any other Commission other than the Gujarat ERC and this filing should serve as a foundation for this rate case and others Merit Order Dispatch Cap The May order treats two concepts as one the least cost purchase policy that determines what power purchase costs are included in the rates for the rate case period is equated with merit order dispatch which is a daytoday operational tool that determines actual purchases The rate case order of May as written did not cap the quantities What the rate case stated and I am not quoting was that quantities in addition to those authorized could be dispatched so long as the average realisation exceeded the cost I would also argue that the India obligation to serve customers provides additional grounds for further dispatch quantities The catch is in two places first whether dispatch of DPC power meets the test Shubh told me recently it did does this continue to hold true Mohan and second the recovery of the power purchase costs due to the variance the difference between what is authorized in the order and what is actually dispatched Recovery of Variance According to Mr Podder the Electricity Supply Act does not allow a carryover of these volumes from one rate case to the next Typically the variance is just included in the next rate case This practice actually provides a utility with an opportunity to overrecover costs for a period of time which is why the goal of a rate case is normally to understate demand We have approached the MSEB rate case however with a different perspective in an attempt to get the revenues up to allow more funds for MSEB to pay its bills As provided in the Act the variance must either be subsidised by the State or absorbed by the SEB This is a major financial problem for the SEBs and should be rectified by GOI Mr Podder is writing down the accounting legal basis in Act and I will forward that memo to you MSEB Representation regarding dispatchMSEB clearly discusses its failure to dispatch more than MU with us in the rate case process Mr Palumvar and Mr Bakshi state that failure to dispatch additional quantities is simply a matter of budget The cost of MU is incuded in the rates and the cost of additional volumes isnt Since there is no way for MSEB to collect the cost for additional volumes other than from the State it is logically not dispatching additional volumes MERC Jurisdiction Thus I have a query lets assume that the MERC does not have jurisdiction to determine least cost purchases or merit order dispatch or to determine a blend of the two Im not sure how that will help MSEB to recover the full costs of its power purchases Logical Area of Focus In my opinion once Sandeep Katwala

aggressive as they need to be for a pessimistic scenario You have assumed that MSEBs average realization per unit in terms actually goes down due to Rs devaluation There are some areas where Jane can shed more light MSEB can increase its average realization simply by limiting supply to agri customers and by not giving any new unmetered connections The latter is something that has been decreed by

Ministers has not approved any specific draft They deliberated on various concepts which approved concepts have been incorporated into the NCAER Draft VII It is our understanding that just prior to his hospitalization the late Minister instructed his Ministry to support the NCAER draft The Prime Minister has assumed the role of Minister of Power until a successor to Mr Kumaramangalam has been appointed Im sure you are aware of the dynamic role the Prime Ministers Office PMO has played in the telecommunications reform in India The same kind of dynamic role should be played by the PMO in power reforms Mr NK Singh is the Secretary to the Minister and was the person who actively worked on the telecommunication reforms If the Secretary of Energy has an opportunity to indicate to Mr Singh

Stephen D NRON Joe NRON Steven J nron Mark CT Neil McGregorENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Electricity Bill Developments Dear David Im so glad you asked for an update We have indeed had an interesting development regarding the Electricity Bill since your visit You will recall that in AMCHAMs briefing it was positively noted that the drafting process of the Electricity Bill had been transparent and that a draft that would provide a blueprint for the restructuring of the electricity sector to move toward competitive markets was attained Noone was percent satisfied probably the mark of a good passable bill but many agreed to the draft and felt while not perfect it would achieve the desired reform We have learned that there are actually two drafts of the Electricity Bill sponsored by the Ministry of Power The first has been developed by NCAER NCAER draft in a very transparent process with seven iterations and comments from parties NCAER was hired as a consultant for this purpose by the Ministry of Power At the time of Draft III a second draft MoP draft was developed in the Ministry which subsequently incorporated some but not all of the NCAER draft provisions negotiated in the transparent process It was the MoP draft that was sent to the Group of Ministers and has been worked on by the Ministry of Law The draft however was never introduced in Parliament The industry discovered the existence of the second MoP draft immediately prior to Minister Kumaramangalams hospitalization and lobbied him and Secretary Basu heavily to introduce the NCAER draft in Parliament or at a minimum allow a transparent commenting process on the MoP draft Several parties in the industry have now been given the MoP draft and Secretary Basu has said he would entertain comments How widely it has been distributed is unknown In addition the death of the Minister who was a staunch advocate of reform and the lack of a named successor has now left things somewhat uncertain The issues as they now stand are The existence of two separate Ministrysponsored drafts only one of which was subjected to a wide sector review process The need to use the product of a transparent commenting process once it has been formulated The fact that the finetuned balance of interests and clear blueprint for a transition to competitive markets achieved by the NCAER draft has been lost in the MoP draft For example the clear deregulation of price provisions in the tariff section have been removed so that there is in the MoP draft full regulation of price by the state commissions however in the state commission section there is a provision that allows the State Commission to permit access to a consumer class and only determine the wheeling charge rather than the wheeling and supply price for that class when it has so determined Thus there is an apparent conflict within the statute regarding the regulation of commodity priceand uncertainty regarding access to end users There are many such examples Action Item Either support the NCAER draft and send it to the Ministry of Law for legal fine tuning Basu mentioned that the form of the NCAER draft was not right or repeat the iterative transparent commenting process with regard to the MoP draft hWe recommend supporting the NCAER draft because it reflects a balance of the multiple sector interests It is the first such document produced through an open process in India and was a process sponsored by the Ministry for that reason alone the Ministry should promote and support the NCAER version Any assistance you can render on this issue will be greatly appreciated by many parties in the sector Let us know how it goes Sincerely Jane Wilson Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Pumphrey David on AM To cc Cutler

Wilson PM To Mark CT cc Subject Mega power status There may be no advantages for us in this megaproject status other than the privilege of becoming fully regulated However the Ministry is considering us and Ken Lay made big announcements to the press After these announcements I pulled a team together on Dabhol strategy The conclusion was that now that weve made our application and annoucement noone asked me See below we must keep up the pretext of appearing to seek the mega project status to look like we are trying to help MSEB The consensus of the group was that probably the whole idea of megaproject status will bite the dust Unbenownst to me a number of letters were filed with the Ministry with MSEB and with CERC requesting mega power project status A letter was filed with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission CERC requesting that CERC use its good offices to obtain this status for Dabhol In a public forum a panel that I moderated at a conference Dr Rao referenced this letter as one filed by a multinational corporation that wouldnt have filed it in its own country improperly asking for the use of influence When he sat back down next to me Dr Rao leaned over and whispered that it was Enron that the name was Sandeep Kohli and that he was certain I didnt know about it I subsequently formally requested its withdrawal much to Raos relief This was Sanjays idea PS its hot in Mumbai now about degrees or so in the daytime Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Jane Wilson AM To Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Mega power status Here is the hand out on mega power project that I handed out in our strategy meeting in January Please note that in the Monday January Business Standard it was reported that the next tranche of mega power projects may get no tax benefits The Union power ministry may not offer tax sops to the projects presently under consideration for mega power project status Official sources confirmed that the new projects would not be offered benefits like customs duties waiver offered to the mega projects cleared last year The only benefit these projects are expected to receive is sale to the Power Trading Corporation PTC whereby the state risk on independent power producers IPPs is transferred to PTC Such sops do not have a major impact on the projects tariff as was initially calculated The power ministry is considereing a proposla to accord mega status to eight projects including the Dabhol venture in Maharashtra Sources however said mega project status would onl be granted on the basis of the tariff quoted by the projects under consideration The Union power ministry has already formed a committee which will analyse the tariffs for these projects so as to accord them the status They said that the committee would be examining the tariffs in accordance to similar project cleared by the Central Electricity Authority Mega power projects are large interstate power venture selling power to more than one state through the Power Trading Corporation The projects that have been notified as mega power projects get special benefits in terms of the customs duty waiver and will enable te government to obtain competitive tariffs from projects These project also get deemed export status wherein domestic equipment suppliers will be entititled to duty drawback and refund of terminal excise duty I now have the Availability Based Tariff Order issued prior to my being involved in India and will analyze it This order will apply to mega power projects as you see in the handout I want to do a full regulatory analysis for us in the next month Please let me know what our current strategic thinking is on the mega project issue I still think that this would not be to Enrons advantage However being realistic something will have to change I just dont think submitting ourselves to regulation by the CERC with one buyer the PTC is to our advantage anyway With potentially no tax advantages what are we thinking However as we discussed in the meeting we must continue the pretext What happens if the dog catches the car On a separte subject I know you are busy with the refocus of our development efforts but obviously I would like to spend some time with you with regard to my reassignment to the India region only at my suggestion by the way Since Im returning to the US on Thursday night the th

justice has advised Enron that MERC has no jurisdiction over the PPA and cannot establish regulations on things like merit order dispatch much less set the merit order dispatch A written legal opinion has been requested The thought of the Linklaters attorneys both Sandeep Katwala and Chris Walker and tentatively Wade is that the MERC may be DPCs worst enemy if it has jurisdiction over the renegotiated PPA which it will and must approve it thus it may be better to take the offensive and challenge its jurisdiction over merit order dispatch The strategy isnt fully formed yet but I wonder about the wisdom of i taking on a regulator that could be in a position to approve a renegotiated PPA and ii how a jurisdictional challenge to a regulator attempting to restructure squares with Enrons positionsreputation worldwide Ill be discussing this with all parties when I get back to work after New Years and will let you know as this issue progresses Enron is as I speak seriously contemplating pulling the letters of credit Weve been told by the Chairman of MSEB that he has some money but he is not going to pay Octobers bill for DPC According to him DPC was forced on MSEB by the Govt of

Mr Palumvar Merit order dispatch has not been clearly treated by the MERC or any other Commission other than the Gujarat ERC and this filing should serve as a foundation for this rate case and others Merit Order Dispatch Cap The May order treats two concepts as one the least cost purchase policy that determines what power purchase costs are included in the rates for the rate case period is equated with merit order dispatch which is a daytoday operational tool that determines actual purchases The rate case order of May as written did not cap the quantities What the rate case stated and I am not quoting was that quantities in addition to those authorized could be dispatched so long as the average realisation exceeded the cost I would also argue that the India obligation to serve customers provides additional grounds for further dispatch quantities The catch is in two places first whether dispatch of DPC power meets the test Shubh told me recently it did does this continue to hold true Mohan and second the recovery of the power purchase costs due to the variance the difference between what is authorized in the order and what is actually dispatched Recovery of Variance According to Mr Podder the Electricity Supply Act does not allow a carryover of these volumes from one rate case to the next Typically the variance is just included in the next rate case This practice actually provides a utility with an opportunity to overrecover costs for a period of time which is why the goal of a rate case is normally to understate demand We have approached the MSEB rate case however with a different perspective in an attempt to get the revenues up to allow more funds for MSEB to pay its bills As provided in the Act the variance must either be subsidised by the State or absorbed by the SEB This is a major financial problem for the SEBs and should be rectified by GOI Mr Podder is writing down the accounting legal basis in Act and I will forward that memo to you MSEB Representation regarding dispatchMSEB clearly discusses its failure to dispatch more than MU with us in the rate case process Mr Palumvar and Mr Bakshi state that failure to dispatch additional quantities is simply a matter of budget The cost of MU is incuded in the rates and the cost of additional volumes isnt Since there is no way for MSEB to collect the cost for additional volumes other than from the State it is logically not dispatching additional volumes MERC Jurisdiction Thus I have a query lets assume that the MERC does not have jurisdiction to determine least cost purchases or merit order dispatch or to determine a blend of the two Im not sure how that will help MSEB to recover the full costs of its power purchases Logical Area of Focus In my opinion once Sandeep Katwala

ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Jane WilsonENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Dabhol question Mohan I have gone through your note and agree with the concept You do have to compare enduser tariff with costs till enduser which will include TD losses You have assumed loss figures which is assuming little or no improvement since this is the worst case scenario Your assumptions on Rs devaluation are also aggressive as they need to be for a pessimistic scenario You have assumed that MSEBs average realization per unit in terms actually goes down due to Rs devaluation There are some areas where Jane can shed more light MSEB can increase its average realization simply by limiting supply to agri customers and by not giving any new unmetered connections The latter is something that has been decreed by MERC Jane please correct me if I am wrong while the former was the most likely cause for Bhaves exit Jane Can you with Akshayas help take a crack at what the agricultural load and unmetered customers are likely to be in the years through Similarly what is the likely growth in the metered cutomer categories Also if Dabhol were to be despatched to the load center at Mumbai following Mohans conclusion of PLF on MW and the plants close to Chandrapur were to despatch less what would be the overall TD loss picture The question to answer here is what portion of the is theft and what is actual TD loss My understanding is that betwen is actual TD loss due to the poor state of the network Further we will have to ask the question whether the actual TD loss is more due to distribution or due to transmission My gut feel is that it is due to distribution The next logical question to tackle then would be what you see as the improvement in distibution between now and Jane Can you take a crack at that Mohan My gut feel is that there will not be a despatch on all three blocks I can envisage that type of despatch in Block B but that will be the optimistic rather than the pessimistic scenario I do not see C being used more than hours daily and that too only in the peak season I had started the team working on a stack and peak and offpeak load curves We need to do more on that Bottom line is that we need much more detailed information on the TD sector on the pace of reform and most importantly on merit order deptaching of the plants building the stack of plants This was

What is our breakeven power price at the overall PLF we think would be achieved if MSEB used marginal economic cost dispatch If we determined that this price was at or above the realised tariff of MSEB then we know ultimatley we will survive the only question is how long it takes us to get our equity back If it is below then the situation may be dire indeed Jim

Ministers has not approved any specific draft They deliberated on various concepts which approved concepts have been incorporated into the NCAER Draft VII It is our understanding that just prior to

appointed Im sure you are aware of the dynamic role the Prime Ministers Office PMO has played in the telecommunications reform in India The same kind of dynamic role should be played by the PMO in power reforms Mr NK Singh is the Secretary to the Minister and was the person who actively worked on the telecommunication reforms If the Secretary of Energy has an opportunity to indicate to Mr Singh and certainly the Prime Minister if possible the need for the Prime Ministers Office to become active in promoting power reforms and the advisability and need to support Draft VII of the Electricity Bill it would be most helpful Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Jane Wilson PM To cc Sanjay BhatnagarENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Ashok MehtaENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Stephen D NRON Joe NRON Steven J nron Mark CT Neil McGregorENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Electricity Bill Developments Dear David Im so glad you asked for an update We have indeed had an interesting development regarding the Electricity Bill since your visit You will recall that in AMCHAMs briefing it was positively noted that the drafting process of the Electricity Bill had been transparent and that a draft that would provide a blueprint for the restructuring of the electricity sector to move toward competitive markets was attained Noone was percent satisfied probably the mark of a good passable bill but many agreed to the draft and felt while not perfect it would achieve the desired reform We have learned that there are actually two drafts of the Electricity Bill sponsored by the Ministry of Power The first has been developed by NCAER NCAER draft in a very transparent process with seven iterations and comments from parties NCAER was hired as a consultant for this purpose by the Ministry of Power At the time of Draft III a second draft MoP draft was developed in the Ministry which subsequently incorporated some but not all of the NCAER draft provisions negotiated in the transparent process It was the MoP draft that was sent to the Group of Ministers and has been worked on by the Ministry of Law The draft however was never introduced in Parliament The industry discovered the existence of the second MoP draft immediately prior to Minister Kumaramangalams hospitalization and lobbied him and Secretary Basu heavily to introduce the NCAER draft in Parliament or at a minimum allow a transparent commenting process on the MoP draft Several parties in the industry have now been given the MoP draft and Secretary Basu has said he would entertain comments How widely it has been distributed is unknown In addition the death of the Minister who was a staunch advocate of reform and the lack of a named successor has now left things somewhat uncertain The issues as they now stand are The existence of two separate Ministrysponsored drafts only one of which was subjected to a wide sector review process The need to use the product of a transparent commenting process once it has been formulated The fact that the finetuned balance of interests and clear blueprint for a transition to competitive markets achieved by the NCAER draft has been lost in the MoP draft For example the clear deregulation of price provisions in the tariff section have been removed so that there is in the MoP draft full regulation of price by the state commissions however in the state commission section there is a provision that allows the State Commission to permit access to a consumer class and only determine the wheeling charge rather than the wheeling and supply price for that class when it has so determined Thus there is an apparent conflict within the statute regarding the regulation of commodity priceand uncertainty regarding access to end users There are many such examples Action Item Either support the NCAER draft and send it to the Ministry of Law for legal fine tuning Basu mentioned that the form of the NCAER draft was not right or repeat the iterative transparent commenting process with regard to the MoP draft hWe recommend supporting the NCAER draft because it reflects a balance of the multiple sector interests It is the first such document produced through an open process in India and was a process sponsored by the Ministry for that reason alone the Ministry should promote and support the NCAER version Any assistance you can render on this issue will be greatly appreciated by many parties in the sector Let us know how it goes Sincerely Jane Wilson Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Pumphrey David on AM To cc Cutler

justice has advised Enron that MERC has no jurisdiction over the PPA and cannot establish regulations on things like merit order dispatch much less set the merit order dispatch A written legal opinion has been requested The thought of the Linklaters attorneys both Sandeep Katwala and Chris Walker and tentatively Wade is that the MERC may be DPCs worst enemy if it has jurisdiction over the renegotiated PPA which it will and must approve it thus it may be better to take the offensive and challenge its jurisdiction over merit order dispatch The strategy isnt fully formed yet but I wonder about the wisdom of i taking on a regulator that could be in a position to approve a renegotiated PPA and ii how a jurisdictional challenge to a regulator attempting to restructure squares with Enrons positionsreputation worldwide Ill be discussing this with all parties when I get back to work after New Years and will let you know as this issue progresses Enron is as I speak seriously contemplating

Mr Palumvar Merit order dispatch has not been clearly treated by the MERC or any other Commission other than the Gujarat ERC and this filing should serve as a foundation for this rate case and others Merit Order Dispatch Cap The May order treats two concepts as one the least cost purchase policy that determines what power purchase costs are included in the rates for the rate case period is equated with merit order dispatch which is a daytoday operational tool that determines actual purchases The rate case order of May as written did not cap the quantities What the rate case stated and I am not quoting was that quantities in addition to those authorized could be dispatched so long as the average realisation exceeded the cost I would also argue that the India obligation to serve customers provides additional grounds for further dispatch quantities The catch is in two places first whether dispatch of DPC power meets the test Shubh told me recently it did does this continue to hold true Mohan and second the recovery of the power purchase costs due to the variance the difference between what is authorized in the order and what is actually dispatched Recovery of Variance According to Mr Podder the Electricity Supply Act does not allow a carryover of these volumes from one rate case to the next Typically the variance is just included in the next rate case This practice actually provides a utility with an opportunity to overrecover costs for a period of time which is why the goal of a rate case is normally to understate demand We have approached the MSEB rate case however with a different perspective in an attempt to get the revenues up to allow more funds for MSEB to pay its bills As provided in the Act the variance must either be subsidised by the State or absorbed by the SEB This is a major financial problem for the SEBs and should be rectified by GOI Mr Podder is writing down the accounting legal basis in Act and I will forward that memo to you MSEB Representation regarding dispatchMSEB clearly discusses its failure to dispatch more than MU with us in the rate case process Mr Palumvar and Mr Bakshi state that failure to dispatch additional quantities is simply a matter of budget The cost of MU is incuded in the rates and the cost of additional volumes isnt Since there is no way for MSEB to collect the cost for additional volumes other than from the State it is logically not dispatching additional volumes MERC Jurisdiction Thus I have a query lets assume that the MERC does not have jurisdiction to determine least cost purchases or merit order dispatch or to determine a blend of the two Im not sure how that will help MSEB to recover the full costs of its power purchases Logical Area of Focus In my opinion once Sandeep Katwala

incuded in the rates and the cost of additional volumes isnt Since there is no way for MSEB to collect the cost for additional volumes other than from the State it is logically not dispatching additional volumes MERC Jurisdiction Thus I have a query lets assume that the MERC does not have jurisdiction to determine least cost purchases or merit order dispatch or to determine a blend of the two Im not sure how that will help MSEB to recover the full costs of its power purchases Logical Area of Focus In my opinion once Sandeep Katwala and team confirms our interpretation of the Act the most beneficial course of action would be to work with the regulatorsGovernmentanyone else to repair the cost recovery mechanism of the Act This helps DPC this helps MSEB and will in the end help the country Might be worth considering Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Sandeep Kohli AM To Mohan GurunathENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Jane WilsonENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Dabhol question Mohan I have gone through your note and agree with the concept You do have to compare enduser tariff with costs till enduser which will include TD losses You have assumed loss figures which is assuming little or no improvement since this is the worst case scenario Your assumptions on Rs devaluation are also aggressive as they need to be for a pessimistic scenario You have assumed that MSEBs average realization per unit in terms actually goes down due to Rs devaluation There are some areas where Jane can shed more light MSEB can increase its average realization simply by limiting supply to agri customers and by not giving any new unmetered connections The latter is something that has been decreed by MERC Jane please correct me if I am wrong while the former was the most likely cause for Bhaves exit Jane Can you with Akshayas help take a crack at what the agricultural load and unmetered customers are likely to be in the years through Similarly what is the likely growth in the metered cutomer categories Also if Dabhol were to be despatched to the load center at Mumbai following Mohans conclusion of PLF on MW and the plants close to Chandrapur were to despatch less what would be the overall TD loss picture The question to answer here is what portion of the is theft and what is actual TD loss My understanding is that betwen is actual TD loss due to the poor state of the network Further we will have to ask the question whether the actual TD loss is more due to distribution or due to transmission My gut feel is that it is due to distribution The next logical question to tackle then would be what you see as the improvement in distibution between now and Jane Can you take a crack at that Mohan My gut feel is that there will not be a despatch on all three blocks I can envisage that type of despatch in Block B but that will be the optimistic rather than the pessimistic scenario I do not see C being used more than hours daily and that too only in the peak season I had started the team working on a stack and peak and offpeak load curves We need to do more on that Bottom line is that we need much more detailed information on the TD sector on the pace of reform and most importantly on merit order deptaching of the plants building the stack of plants This was Jims concern too when we met this morning and we

questions However here is one more I was thinking about how to determine our worst case While considering this I came up with a question I couldnt answer What is our breakeven power price at the overall PLF we think would be achieved if MSEB used marginal economic cost dispatch If we determined that this price was at or above the realised tariff of MSEB then we know ultimatley we will survive the only question is how long it takes us to get our equity back If it is below then the situation may be dire indeed Jim

<29952399.1075846354913.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jane.wilson@enron.com,2000-09-11 03:11:00,Update on the Update on the Electricity Bill Cc updates clarifications and suggestions To be clear the Group of Ministers has not approved any specific draft They deliberated on various concepts which approved concepts have been incorporated into the NCAER Draft VII It is our understanding that just prior to his hospitalization the late Minister instructed his Ministry to support the NCAER draft The Prime Minister has assumed the role of Minister of Power until a successor to Mr Kumaramangalam has been appointed Im sure you are aware of the dynamic role the Prime Ministers Office PMO has played in the telecommunications reform in India The same kind of dynamic role should be played by the PMO in power reforms Mr NK Singh is the Secretary to the Minister and was the person who actively worked on the telecommunication reforms If the Secretary of Energy has an opportunity to indicate to Mr Singh and certainly the Prime Minister if possible the need for the Prime Ministers Office to become active in promoting power reforms and the advisability and need to support Draft VII of the Electricity Bill it would be most helpful Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Jane Wilson PM To cc Sanjay BhatnagarENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Ashok MehtaENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Stephen D NRON Joe NRON Steven J nron Mark CT Neil McGregorENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Electricity Bill Developments Dear David Im so glad you asked for an update We have indeed had an interesting development regarding the Electricity Bill since your visit You will recall that in AMCHAMs briefing it was positively noted that the drafting process of the Electricity Bill had been transparent and that a draft that would provide a blueprint for the restructuring of the electricity sector to move toward competitive markets was attained Noone was percent satisfied probably the mark of a good passable bill but many agreed to the draft and felt while not perfect it would achieve the desired reform We have learned that there are actually two drafts of the Electricity Bill sponsored by the Ministry of Power The first has been developed by NCAER NCAER draft in a very transparent process with seven iterations and comments from parties NCAER was hired as a consultant for this purpose by the Ministry of Power At the time of Draft III a second draft MoP draft was developed in the Ministry which subsequently incorporated some but not all of the NCAER draft provisions negotiated in the transparent process It was the MoP draft that was sent to the Group of Ministers and has been worked on by the Ministry of Law The draft however was never introduced in Parliament The industry discovered the existence of the second MoP draft immediately prior to Minister Kumaramangalams hospitalization and lobbied him and Secretary Basu heavily to introduce the NCAER draft in Parliament or at a minimum allow a transparent commenting process on the MoP draft Several parties in the industry have now been given the MoP draft and Secretary Basu has said he would entertain comments How widely it has been distributed is unknown In addition the death of the Minister who was a staunch advocate of reform and the lack of a named successor has now left things somewhat uncertain The issues as they now stand are The existence of two separate Ministrysponsored drafts only one of which was subjected to a wide sector review process The need to use the product of a transparent commenting process once it has been formulated The fact that the finetuned balance of interests and clear blueprint for a transition to competitive markets achieved by the NCAER draft has been lost in the MoP draft For example the clear deregulation of price provisions in the tariff section have been removed so that there is in the MoP draft full regulation of price by the state commissions however in the state commission section there is a provision that allows the State Commission to permit access to a consumer class and only determine the wheeling charge rather than the wheeling and supply price for that class when it has so determined Thus there is an apparent conflict within the statute regarding the regulation of commodity priceand uncertainty regarding access to end users There are many such examples Action Item Either support the NCAER draft and send it to the Ministry of Law for legal fine tuning Basu mentioned that the form of the NCAER draft was not right or repeat the iterative transparent commenting process with regard to the MoP draft hWe recommend supporting the NCAER draft because it reflects a balance of the multiple sector interests It is the first such document produced through an open process in India and was a process sponsored by the Ministry for that reason alone the Ministry should promote and support the NCAER version Any assistance you can render on this issue will be greatly appreciated by many parties in the sector Let us know how it goes Sincerely Jane Wilson Forwarded by Jane WilsonENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Pumphrey David on AM To cc Cutler

operational tool that determines actual purchases The rate case order of May as written did not cap the quantities What the rate case stated and I am not quoting was that quantities in addition to those authorized could be dispatched so long as the average realisation exceeded the cost I would also argue that the India obligation to serve customers provides additional grounds for further

power purchase costs due to the variance the difference between what is authorized in the order and what is actually dispatched Recovery of Variance According to Mr Podder the Electricity Supply Act does not allow a carryover of these volumes from one rate case to the next Typically the variance is just included in the next rate case This practice actually provides a utility with an opportunity to overrecover costs for a period of time which is why the goal of a rate case is normally to understate demand We have approached the MSEB rate case however with a different perspective in an attempt to get the revenues up to allow more funds for MSEB to pay its bills As provided in the Act the variance must either be subsidised by the State or absorbed by the SEB This is a major financial problem for the SEBs and should be rectified by GOI Mr Podder is writing down the accounting legal basis in Act and I will forward that memo to you MSEB Representation regarding dispatchMSEB clearly discusses

have assumed loss figures which is assuming little or no improvement since this is the worst case scenario Your assumptions on Rs devaluation are also aggressive as they need to be for a pessimistic scenario You have assumed that MSEBs average realization per unit in terms actually goes down due to Rs devaluation There are some areas where Jane can shed more light MSEB can increase its average realization simply by limiting supply to agri customers and by not giving any new unmetered connections The latter is something that has been decreed by MERC Jane please correct me if I am wrong while

what is the likely growth in the metered cutomer categories Also if Dabhol were to be despatched to the load center at Mumbai following Mohans conclusion of PLF on MW and the plants close to Chandrapur were to despatch less what would be the overall TD loss picture The question to answer here is what portion of the is theft and what is actual TD loss My understanding is that betwen is actual TD loss due to the poor state of the network Further we will have to ask the question whether the actual TD loss is more due to distribution or due to transmission My gut feel is that it is due

justice has advised Enron that MERC has no jurisdiction over the PPA and cannot establish regulations on things like merit order dispatch much less set the merit order dispatch A written legal opinion has been requested The thought of the Linklaters attorneys both Sandeep Katwala and Chris Walker and tentatively Wade is that the MERC may be DPCs worst enemy if it has jurisdiction over the renegotiated PPA which it will and must approve it thus it may be better to take the offensive and challenge its jurisdiction over merit order dispatch The strategy isnt fully formed yet but I wonder about the wisdom of i taking on a regulator that could be in a position to approve a renegotiated PPA and ii how a jurisdictional challenge to a regulator attempting to restructure squares with Enrons positionsreputation worldwide Ill be discussing this with all parties when I get back to work after New Years and will let you know as this issue progresses Enron is as I speak seriously contemplating pulling the letters of credit Weve been told by the Chairman of MSEB that he has some money but he is not going to pay Octobers bill for DPC According to him DPC was forced on MSEB by the Govt of
