Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein DrKW has purchased analytic software that it hopes will put it on the cutting edge of risk management WhiteLight Systems the Palo Alto CAbased company has announced that the investment bank selected analytics and Web reporting software for a global risk management solution in a licences and services contract valued at million The bank is using WhiteLight to develop applications that will help control the banks exposure to risk DrKW hopes the applications will improve the visibility of data about its investment banking portfolio such as foreign exchange equities and derivatives to a much wider range of business decision makers across the global business and provide a more flexible system for interrogating the data The bank also expects the new applications to uncover new product and market opportunities The initial project involves developing three applications credit risk market risk and product control Based on WhiteLights AnalyticServer DrKW will roll out the applications in across its major international trading centers including Frankfurt London New York and Tokyo AnalyticServers multidimensional modeling engine is at the core of WhiteLights application suite It is designed to allow complex interactive analysis within large and varying data sources Additionally DrKW has selected iApplicationServer WhiteLights solution for Webbased analytics to enable DrKWs decision makers worldwide to operate from a unified global view of business data Using iApplicationServer the German bank will be able to create and deploy interactive reports to any user on the Web The bank is not talking about its purchase but Peter Beard WhiteLights vice president of world wide sales could confirm that DrKW is our biggest physical user in the world It has WhiteLight servers in production and it has purchased the largest number of our servers within our customer base in the shortest amount of time Other project areas within the bank are looking at how to use WhiteLight Other European banks are considering buying the technology developed as the next step up from online analytical processing OLAP which is regarded as increasingly unwieldy and inflexible in the wake of the ebusiness revolution Merrill Lynch predicts that the total e business analytics market opportunity will top billion by Growing market Its a fact that the scope of business is ever expanding from the size of an institutions operations to the markets and customers it can reach At the same time market conditions and customer requirements change rapidly and there are more factors and variables to be considered before decisions can be made WhiteLight says Gartner analysts agree and they predict significant growth in the predictive analytics business By enterprises will need three times as many professionals on their analytic staff as they need today Gartner believes and the demand for analytic talent today outweighs supply by at least two to one The killer trend for ebusiness will likely be the realtime enterprise ie an enterprise able to collect nearly instantaneous feedback on business processes and to take the right adaptive corrective or preventative action Web analytics enables executives and managers to know where the company stands in its quest to become a realtime enterprise and when the company will achieve realtime business capability across all channels from the shop floor to the emarketplace says Gartner Accordingly a new generation of analytic applications dubbed predictive analytics is needed to help managers understand what is happening and why and to test the outcome of prospective decisions WhiteLights Analytic Application Suite has been developed to allow the nearinstant extraction of critical and previously unavailable decisionsupport information from large and complex databases the company says It is still very new and can be categorized as an early adopter market says Beard of the technology People are looking at two scenarios There are those companies that want to be leading edge or those which have used traditional methods of risk management and found their limits With operational risk the only way to do anything remotely like we do is with Excel and it results in the page spreadsheet from hell which only one or two people in the company can understand We can put the data on a server rather than a desktop and all users are permitted to see all facets Business managers or analysts dont need to know SQL to create multidimensional models They can define formulas and data sources using a drag and drop interface According to Beard All the products that have grown up over the last years have been what I call rearview mirror technology Its historical data looking at where you have come from Predictive analytics takes the same data but in increasingly large volumes and puts it into a model so that analysts can interact with that What if for example there were to be a change in the underlying rate by basis points You can make the change and see the impact across the entire model Growing interest Although the impact of predictive analytics on DrKWs bottom line is not yet known WhiteLight says that one of its clients involved in loan collateralization believes it will be able to return million to the balance sheet thanks to the software Financial institutions will also be able to hang onto costly legacy systems says Beard Every bank has legacy systems on which they have spent millions We sit above that in a platform Pertinent data is modeled within the WhiteLight server Other financial institutions in Europe are keen to follow in DrKWs footsteps says Beard who already counts Barclays JP Morgan Chase and Lehman Brothers among his companys customers We are involved in a major project with a large multinational Dutch bank with the same profile as DrKW It is an existing customer with whom we will be putting the technology group wide It owns a number of other banks across Germany and Holland And over the next month we will be able to announce three new contracts in Switzerland Germany and Holland The Bank for International Settlements BIS has created a groundswell of interest in predictive analytic applications with its new Basel Capital Accord The accord is based on three pillars that allow banks to evaluate properly the various risks they face It focuses on minimum capital requirements the supervisory review of an institutions capital adequacy and market discipline through effective disclosure to encourage safe and sound banking practices according to the BIS The new accord will be finalized at the end of the year and is expected to be implemented in member jurisdictions by It will be a real benefit to banks if they can reduce the amount of provision they must have It is a clearly defined initiative with massive tangible benefits says Beard Copyright Thomson Financial All rights reserved Format
