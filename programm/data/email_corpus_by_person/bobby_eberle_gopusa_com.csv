Chernin Rogoff Thank you Bonnie Rogoff for speaking out on truths We all need to raise the volume for we are all that is left to be heard We must retake the principals of the Republican Party and unmerge the right from the left Your article is a beginning step in the right direction Judith Pratt OK I have to say that I agree that abortion is wrong and anyone who does so is a murderer However I believe that President Bush is doing the best he can and his ability is a great one I think he is just waiting for the right time to pick up the prolife issue again He doesnt want to endanger reelection and playing nice to the moderates and liberals will help him get reelected and then he can start really putting the prolife message out Tony Lemaster Hats off to Bonnie for having the courage to say we should cut off W for his shameful pandering to the leftist media by shunning the Republican prolife platform In the time since thousands were killed by the terrorists on how many thousands of unborns have been killed with the passive blessing of the establishment GOP with Bush and Ashcroft not lifting a finger to protect them Don Zimmerman Its about time that Abortion is

old and sitting in the ornate Kimo Theater in Albuque rque NM with my parents I remember crying out loud in the auditorium Q uinns line as he rode across the screen after Zapata was killed No no hes not dead Hes in the mountains with his people The movie whose scr eenplay was written by John Steinbeck can be seen on classic movie station s on cable sometimes and still brings tears to my eyes Mexican and other Latin actors were relatively common in the s and early s Gilbert Ro land Cesar Romero Desi Arnaz Ricardo Montalban Carmen Miranda Dolores Del Rio and Linda Darnell were romantic

principles McCarthy was right the public was naive and w e are beginning to see more clearly that Hollywood is little more than a v ast propaganda machine for the political ideology of the left This is a causation not a correlation to borrow a term from the statisticians from the election mess Contrary to their selfserving press Hollywood no long er writes what the public wants to see They write what they want the publi c to believe Take your pick of platforms comedy satire drama or action adventure offerings over recent years have been little more than outrigh t advocacy for world government leftist ideology glamorization of the bad behavior of Democratic politicians and attacks on the constitution and th e rights contained therein If conservatives are going to put this to right s we need to be less naive about the venom housed in the snakepit of Holly wood We also need to fund some movies that portray things more accurately Gregg Bish Fremont MichiganRe Counterfeit America I loved it

are malnourished One in every four children wont live past the age of five because health care is not available Women have been denied access to doctors when theyre sick Life under the Taliban is so

FNC went on the air in viewer demand for the cable news service with popular hosts like Bill OReilly has increased dramatically The latest ratings show OReilly defeating the Cable News Networks CNN

and the principles that underlie our way of life has come just in time Nothing is more important than restoring clarity in the minds of our young people about the crucial role that each and every citizen plays in the life of this Republic Throughout human history selfgovernment by the people has been almost nonexistent Ours is the first great nation to sustain an experiment in this kind of selfgovernment over the course of centuries Our founders understood that the effort to establish a government based on the consent of the governed was exceptional and difficult Because of the success of the experiment we have had a tendency to take it for granted But to live under a regime that respects the rights and dignity of all where we each have some share of participation in the decisions that shape the destiny of our community and our future is a blessing an extraordinary blessing It will be a fatal mistake if we continue to take it for granted Read more at alankeyesakshtml Bush Superbly Cleans Up Clintons Mess By Carol DevineMolin As of this writing the Taliban forces are in full retreat as critical cities MazareSharif and the capital Kabul are now firmly under the control of the Americanbacked insurgents from the Northern Alliance The cities of Kandahar and Jalalabad are about to topple with the Taliban fleeing to the mountains in an attempt to regroup and launch guerrilla style attacks upon their enemies Contemporaneously US Special Operations troops are in keen pursuit and zeroing in on Osama bin Ladens al Qaeda terrorist network And the worst fears of the civilized world were confirmed upon the discovery of a nuclear device blueprint found at a bombedout al Qaeda safe house in Kabul This blueprint and other documents unearthed at that site represent a US intelligence bonanza verifying that bin Ladens organization indeed has access to fissile materials for the construction of nuclear and radiological weaponry Moreover in anticipation that suspected terrorists will be apprehended forthwith President Bush has signed an executive order establishing a military tribunal to try these murderous thugs Read more at caroldevinemolincdmshtml Vladmir Putin

years as socalled president of Russia Until his appearance as the new Russian president Putin spent most of his career as a member of the KGB He doesnt look like a mean man he doesnt have the evil look of Stalin Khruschev or any number of ArabIslamic leaders Actually his face is rather bland at times almost boyish Good spies which is what Putin was for many years never look like Hollywoods idea

world Much good has come to pass Much more is coming Our nation was stabbed in the heart with a bitter dagger September The wound was deep Rather more like a cancer patient hearing of the onset of a dread disease than a victim of a vicious assault however America responded The response surprised many though often those who were surprised were younger less informed and less understanding types whose life experience has been limited to a world shaped in the days following the Viet Nam War It has seemed uncanny to these types that America instead of blindly lashing out or retreating into a

Psychology By SARTRE Events since have created a deep seeded dread towards the future in the minds of many Americans What was attacked on that day was not buildings alone The deaths that were snuffed out were not the only victims from the act of terror The feeling of anguish has overtaken much of the public psyche as the tone of the continuous reporting and reflection has exposed an uncertainty

Limbaugh By Carol DevineMolin In recent years Cables Fox News Channel has catapulted television journalist Bill OReilly to the top of the ratings heap with The OReilly Factor his widely lauded current affairs program OReilly promptly followed that up with a further wave of success as a best selling author his latest tome being The No Spin Zone Now just this past week Internet reporter and gadfly Matt Drudge made the claim that OReilly was throwing down the gauntlet to Rush Limbaugh determined to challenge the well established radio star on his own turf According to Drudge OReillys representatives were actively pitching a hour daily radiocast to air directly opposite RadioKing Rush Limbaugh with a network deal said to be imminent But with all on his career plate why would OReilly seek an incursion into radio now That would be a natural query given the circumstances Indeed Drudge did broach OReillys timing on the matter noting that It is not clear if OReilly views the Limbaugh franchise as weakened and vulnerable since Limbaugh announced earlier this season that he has lost his hearing or if the timing of the OReilly move is simply a natural progression of his media success Clearly before resorting to this type of explosive speculation Drudge should have contacted OReilly for clarification and input A member of OReillys staff would have surely returned Matt Drudges phone call Read more at caroldevinemolincdmshtml Applaud Bush for Limiting The Medias Role in The War on Terrorism By Rick Erickson General Tecumseh Sherman executed one of the most triumphant campaigns in military history by ruthlessly trampling his enemys symbols and by methodically devastating their will to fight If not for Shermans relentless warfare and President Lincolns trust in General Grants choice of tacticians the Civil Wars objective was not achievable because prior to Shermans March to The Sea anything less than vindictive war failed to carry the day Generals fighting our War on Terrorism have Shermans tactics in mind From day one a relentless strategy proved effective as Al Qaeda symbols dematerialized and as the formerly defiant Taliban demonstrated zero will to fight for Usama bin Laden Yet the media is in a frenzy to be skeptical of the wars vindication and success Read more at opinionreshtml The Best Defense By Kerri Houston As the airport security bill heads up Pennsylvania Avenue for a presidential signature it appears Congress may have missed the flight The focus of the debate should have been solely about security And not just security at the airports but security on the airliners Unfortunately they strayed Airborne safety includes reinforced doors cabin cameras air marshals and armed pilots Although both the Senate and House had already voted in favor of arming pilots several conferees including Arizona Sen John McCain tried and failed to strip this already approved language out of the final bill It is important that Congress affirmed the right of pilots to carry firearms before the FAA could follow through with plans for new regulations to strip pilots of their ability to defend themselves and their passengers through the prudent use of firearms Read more at kerrihoustonkhshtml Dealing with Realities Economy War and the Unknown By Dorothy Anne Seese The radio is still a great device even in this age of scifi Tuning the dial during the night the wee hours of the morning can give a glimpse of the various levels of reality with which Americans are now trying to cope It isnt all that pretty but its better to be aware than asleep at the switch As a nation we spent too long in our Emerald Kingdom of dreams and fantasies false assurances by a negligent government that handed out money like cotton candy and a stock market that seemingly defied gravity Taken in relatively small doses talk radio can be a crosssection of American public thinking the Jane and Joe Average concerns There is of course the reality of a Thanksgiving where not all the family was home for dinner because some are in unknown places in or around Central Asia or the Indian Ocean That was layered over the usual Thanksgiving for the homeless

religious leadership has taken over the institutional Churches in America Once upon a time their mission was preaching the gospel Today the assignment is to get and keep taxexempt status The holy grail is an IRS c nonprofit tax exempt corporation Incorporation of any kind accepts the rule of the State over an organization Why in the world certainly not a requirement of heaven would an assembly of believers consider themselves a trust of the government The unfortunate answer is an acceptance that avoiding paying taxes is more important than exhortation of the message Some will say this kind of filing is but a minor matter and does not diminish from the tasks of a ministry They are just being realistic to the organizational methods of a modern society Well all the rationalization that one can muster will not change the reality that a church is NOT a corporation In a day when many charities have a suspect record why are so many houses of worship so eager to join the accounting rush to seek deductions exemptions and those blessed privileges of a special status Read more at sartresartreshtml Expand RICO Guilt By Association to Cover Terrorists By Marc Levin In Vietnam most historians agree that America fought with one hand tied behind its back In the current war against terrorism we may be doing the same but not because of our lack of political will Instead we are constrained by our commitment to individual liberty and due process One illustration of this is our lax criminal law that prevents us from convicting terrorists based on guilt by association The US declined an offer by Sudan to extradite Osama bin Laden in because it lacked sufficient evidence to convict him in a US court While bin Laden had not committed most of his terrorist acts at that point we knew that he was in the process of organizing a vast terrorist network Read more at opinionmlshtml Void By Kevin Tuma The latest Kevin Tuma cartoon can be found on the GOPUSA web site by clicking on the following

Next week the House of Representativeswill be voting on an airline security bill that Congressman Don Young has introduced It was modeled after proposals I made last month Under the Young bill the federalgovernment will assume complete control of airport security and screening It alsogreatly expands the Federal Air Marshal program and provides substantial new fundingfor secure cockpits and other security measures aboard airplanes Theres a critical difference between the Young bill and the bill the Senate passed a fewweeks ago My approach gives the government the flexibility it needs to assemble askilled and disciplined screening work force Read more at bushradioshtml Permanent Principles of Liberty By Alan Keyes Our current national travails have provoked much talk of a new spirit of trusting government Certainly it is important and desirable that the citizens of a nation at war have confidence and trust in their government We should be mindful however that this need for trust cuts both ways War tends necessarily to increase the concentration of power in the federal government and particularly in the executive branch In a free republic such times as war increase as well the necessity that citizens trust their own judgment Even as we willingly accept the increased energy of the government in those areas where it is truly necessary we must increase as well our vigilant insistence that government power respect the permanent principles of liberty The particular danger in times of war or crisis is that the legitimate need for energetic government action will provide cover for those who from vice or ignorance seek to expand government power at the expense of the very liberty which it is governments purpose to secure Read more at alankeyesakshtml Torturing Terrorists For Information By Carol DevineMolin Recent media reports indicate that the FBI is frustrated noting difficulties in extracting information from approximately suspected terrorists that remain in custody pursuant to the September th Day of Infamy Among the many zippedmouthed individuals there is detainee Zacarias Moussaoui a Moroccan national with close ties to the hijackers and allegedly key in the current investigation How should the FBI address this thorny predicament of silent suspects Interestingly the idea of resorting to torture of suspects is being publicly floated at this juncture which should give us pause This is possibly a public relations trial balloon by the government in order to calibrate American response to what may become an unsavory reality of war and to psychologically inoculate Americans before accounts begin to surface Read more at caroldevinemolincdmshtml Empowerment Not Enfeeblement The Citizen Response to Terrorism By Gregg Bish Our nation is wrapped in a deep emotionally wrought debate over controlling terrorism Nightly talk television programs are filled start to finish over individuals and organizations advocating everything from outright racial profiling directed at Arab appearing individuals to hiring thirty thousand federal shock police to stand post at the luggage checkin and security portals The Bill of Rights trembles in its very frame at the stampede of good intentions and short wit directed its way It can be expected that following any trauma the public will respond with its emotions showing sharply on its sleeve

nation under God exalting and realizing the will of the Creator as each of us fulfill our unique destinies as free men and women Yet in the midst of this I am also saddened and dismayed by things I am hearing from some of my fellow citizens and from some of our allies abroad What type of thinking could conclude that the horrendous murderous act that occurred on September th can be justified in any way and that somehow this grotesque behavior is our fault What type ofthinking could possibly conclude that a cowardly act resulting in the murder of innocent men women and children is religious or

has it been for the last several thousand years of human history Its just more global in both impact and in news coverage For the United States and North America in general war that affects this nations home soil is new because of the isolation we enjoyed in the th century It must be remembered that war on US soil was common from the American Revolution through the War between the North and South It was conventional war even primitive compared to todays technological warfare but death is death whether by musket by nuclear weapons or by bioterrorism What we must remember is that peace at any price isnt peace and will never result in anything other than more bloodshed Cleansing practices particularly of a vanquished enemy where there has been longstanding hatred is common practice and has been since the beginning of recorded history Socalled peaceniks and the mentallymanipulated students who generally fall for the socialist line of drivel would do well to remember that the only

today from Shanghai China at an international meeting of Pacific Rim nations where we are continuing to enlist the resources of the civilized world in our war against terrorism I am meeting with leaders from China and Mexico Russia and Canada Australia and Japan and many other friends allies and trading partners Were discussing ways to cooperate to improve intelligence freeze funding and better track down terrorist groups Were also discussing ways to better protect all our citizens from a new threat the threat of bioterrorism America has now confirmed several different cases of anthrax exposure in Florida New York New Jersey and Washington DC I commend the many health and law enforcement officials who have worked quickly to identify people who may have been exposed and provide preventative antibiotic treatment Their quick work has no doubt saved lives Read more at bushradioshtml Controlling Our Fear By Alan Keyes The nature scope and source of the anthrax assault on the United States may be much more evident by the time you read this Already it is clear that the scattered partially successful attempts to distribute the deadly spores have had some success in frightening millions of people who have no reasonable likelihood of being affected Some are calling for authorities to restrict or even suppress reporting of additional cases lest the fear spread or become a panic But this kind of response to adversity is incompatible with the requirements of liberty or selfgovernment The situation we must confront should make us all ask ourselves who is finally responsible for controlling our fear It is a question with serious implications for a free people Bravery is the virtue of having the right amount of fear and confidence in the face of real danger and of acting accordingly It requires reason and disciplined passions This is a combination we should know something about in the land of the free and the home of the brave Read more at alankeyesakshtml Smallpox As Bioterrorism A Major Threat Looms By Carol DevineMolin Although this nation is beset by anthrax anxiety its important to place the current threat in perspective To date only the offices of a few politicians and big media outlets appear to have been targeted by anthrax mailings And despite the apoplectic reaction from many the anthrax assault has resulted in only one death with a handful of individuals manifesting the disease and approximately forty others tested and found to exhibit asymptomatic exposure to the substance Clearly this is a form of bioterrorism with Islamic fanatics considered the prime suspects by most although some perpetrators of hoaxes and copycat activities are under investigation as well Read more at caroldevinemolincdmshtml ANTHRAX Why Such a Panic By Gregg Bish The panic over anthrax is more a sign of the times than a sign of fear at terrorist activity Listening to the news on Saturday morning TV one could come away with the notion that every other person in the US was infected with anthrax and those not infected were exposed All of the major news outlets CBS NBC ABC Fox and CNN carried at least one headline news article regarding the anthrax scare It is a sign of the times that one death less than a dozen infections and fewer than a hundred exposures would set the emotional and financial wellbeing of the nation on its ear We have forgotten much Read more at greggbishgbshtml Hijacking the Language of Terrorism By Doug Patton War is peace Freedom is slavery Ignorance is strength From the novel by George Orwell Some believe that the terror of Orwells masterful vision with its twoway telescreens installed in every home constantly reminding citizens that Big Brother is watching lay in its portrayal of the absolute totalitarian control of every citizens movements As one who deals in the nuance of language I have always found the prospect of Newspeak much more troubling Newspeak was an entire language Orwell created for the construction of the world of Instead of evolving as most language does Newspeak devolved with each passing year until words once taken for granted no longer existed had been replaced by something entirely different or completely opposite in meaning or had no meaning at all Hence the slogan War is peacefreedom is slaveryignorance is strength Over the last twenty years political correctness has brought Newspeak to our modern world Many of us viewed it as mere silliness or a passing fad No more Newspeak has come with a vengeance to America and to its war on terror Read more at dougpattondpshtml The Harsh Economic Costs of By SARTRE Now that the task of recovery has begun in earnest we need to evaluate the after effects of the earth shattering massacre With estimates well over Billion Dollars for New York City alone we are in store for some major realignments in the national economy The federal government will subsidize and grant a large portion of these funds Coming out of our pockets is nothing new for most of us But the underlying changes to the functions of the Capitalistic order may well be much more significant in the long run First it needs to be noted that the economic system that now goes under the so called title of Capitalism no longer conforms to even an expanded definition of Free Enterprise The reality of economic life in the United States can best be understood as an alliance of the CorporationsMoneyInterestGovernment Axis The central structures that serve as the positional referent is the nature of this axis The beneficiaries of this confederation are owners managers employees investment bankers security brokers speculators investors politicians bureaucrats judges and lawyers Their degrees of benefit are not equal but each has a vestige interest in protecting the functions of the present status quo Resistance to meaningful reform or fundamental realignment is at the core of most policy decisions Read more at sartresartreshtml

How can we go about our daily lives as the president rightly instructs us when every hour seems to bring new stories of yet another possible exposure to anthrax or a government warning that further attacks on the United States or American interests abroad may be imminent Worst of all with hour cable television it is possible to spend virtually all our waking hours being bombarded with breaking news much of which later turns out not to be true or at least not quite what it seemed at first Is watching this stuff hour after hour any different than watching game shows or soap operas all day

attacks on September th Some people see the anthrax attacks as a sign that we should be wary in engaging the terrorists and the nations that harbor them Peaceniks who protested Americas strikes against Taliban targets have been preaching that nothing good will come out of bombing Afghanistan The President and other departments of the Federal government have already warned the nation that new

we will never hear from him again Richard Littiken Bravo Horowitz Noam Chomsky has been a left wing know it all for many years As a young student many years ago I remember reading his silly socialist leanings and hearing the professors rave about Chomskys analysis What is clear is that the world has once again tried to paint the USA as the evil doers and the international business community as

politics needs to be made With the distraction that passes for understanding few have a grasp on the nature of social relations Politics is normally defined as the activities or affairs of government But it really is the art of human relations applied to the organization of society The basis for government grows out of the perceived need to establish order Rules are the results of a desire to

fundamentalists is quite ironic because fundamentalism is adhering to the core of ones belief system which would be an indictment of the Islam of the Quran as advocating terrorism America will never be destroyed from without whether a few planes are taken down or not The recent airport fiascos are a testimony to our hysteria rather than to the common sense alternative of arming the pilot and first officer with guns and the flight attendants with stun guns While all the airport boondoggles are wasting time and enormous amounts of money the Islamic radicals could be out purchasing

Terror War Phase Letters from the Email Bag New Poll shows the Existence of Political Bias on Ivy League Faculties David Horowitz President of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture today released a poll taken on the beliefs and attitudes of Ivy League professors The survey conducted by the Luntz Research Companies reveals a disturbing lack of intellectual diversity among the Ivy League professors polled and raises questions about political bias in the hiring of faculty at schools training Americas future elites The survey was conducted among professors on the social science and liberal arts faculties at the schools David Horowitz said This survey confirms what I have been saying for years that our universities are less intellectually free than they were even in the

elegant and a profoundly simpler diplomatic issue if Somalia mimicked Julius Caesars assessment of Gaul and merely split into three parts It doesnt Anarchic Somalia is arguably the planets foremost failed state with Afghanistan and the Congo as basketcase competitors Find a subclan with a savvy leader or a gang on a street corner and you have what passes for governing structure in much of

business and I have been on record opposing it for years But Im not opposed to allowing no requiring airlines to pay closer attention to passengers that fit a terrorist profile which includes national origin The problem is distinguishing between what is permissible indeed prudent behavior and what is merely bigotry As the Christmas day incident involving an Arab American Secret Service agent who was denied passage on an American Airlines makes clear its not always easy to tell the difference Racial profiling entails picking someone out for special scrutiny simply because of his race It happens when highway patrolmen pull over blacks whove committed no traffic violations for spot checks but ignore other drivers who share similar characteristics say outofstate plates or expensive cars It happens when security guards at a mall tail black customers in stores or insist on inspecting only their bags ignoring whites The underlying presumption in these cases is that blacks are more likely to be involved in criminal acts because of the color of their skin Read more at lindachavezlcshtml And now a word from our sponsor Were a great nation Were a nation of resolve Were a nation

gubernatorial frontrunner and current US Senator John Breaux announced that he would not be a candidate in the Louisiana governors race Breaux had previously been heralded as an unstoppable candidate by political pundits and at varying times appeared to be a likely contender Evidence of his early support could be found in the parking lot of the hotel where he held his press conference in which there were several cars sporting bumper stickers that read Breaux for Governor However the best hope for the Democrats to take back the governors office opted out of the race stating that he can

Family leaving Bethlehem has a long journey ahead of it And there are other reminders for us in the Christmas story some cheerful and others less so Among these are the families that remained in Bethlehem grieving over the sacrifice of innocent children killed at Herods command This Christmas has been indelibly marked by the events of Sept and the ongoing struggle against terrorism Yet it is not these evils which the slaughter of innocents at the first Christmas should most bring to mind A greater grief than international terror afflicts us because our children who are the future of

DevineMolin I noticed that the ground was beginning to shift last summer with the reemergence of machismo males or truly masculine men if you will embracing their testosteronedriven behaviors and coming back into style In a scene reminiscent of the movie Jaws eight year old Jessie Arbogast lost his arm stemming from an attack by a foot bull shark on July th of last year in Florida The young victims uncle Vance Flosenzier was there to intervene in a spectacular manner at the onset In an amazing accomplishment Flosenzier proceeded to drag that dastardly shark that carnivorous sea beast to the shore with only his bare hands and brute force for the purpose of extracting the boys arm from the sharks gut In our collective memory none of us had ever heard of such a thing being done before And everyone loved it And the Day of Infamy only generated more respect for the intrepid manly men of the working class the firefighters policemen and emergency workers who braved life and limb to rescue those at the World Trade Center As President Bush has indicated the tragic circumstances of have caused us to reevaluate our priorities and to sort out that which is truly important in life And

Euro Euro Euro all around but not a pence of real money to spend With these euro notes of this common currency the wire services heap praise on its successful launch The wheels of business and the mechanism of finance are all in gear to usher in this brave new world of commerce For years we have heard the benefits of the first united coinage since the Roman Empire and the elimination of the chaos of individual currencies So what will this conversion mean for Europe and the rest of the world The conclusion largely depends on what you consume from the political plate and whether you wish to place your thumb on the scale that weighs the beef The traditions of Europe are quite different from those of the original colonies when it comes to a monetary perspective With the founding of our Nation constitutional powers were enumerated regarding the nature and coinage of money Individual States were restricted from their own coinage while punishment for counterfeiting was established Standard weights and measures of gold and silver were defined as legal tender So what does this have to do with the modern world and the financial developments on the continent Read more at

from the Email Bag Enrons Political Contributions Another Bad Investment By Marc Levin Recent revelations about Enrons extensive political contributions have been portrayed as impugning the integrity of the Bush administration and bolstering the case for campaign finance reform However upon closer scrutiny it is apparent that Enrons bevy of political contributions provided the company little political power when it most needed it Thus far from proving the need for campaign finance reform the Enron debacle illustrates that political contributions may be one of the worst investments a business can make The real lesson from this fiasco may be that company shareholder representatives and boards of directors should be more skeptical of the utility of corporate political expenditures

of our union and I will present a budget that sets the priorities of our government for fiscal year Our highest priorities are clear to all We must give our military every tool and weapon it needs to

that will determine whether that war secures or loses our liberty Much depends on the kind of contribution average American citizens make to this effort How can we help protect American liberty and strengthen it in the process Some history will help answer this question After the Second World War the governing concept of American military policy shifted from mobilization to readiness on the assumption that we had to be ready for conflict on a relatively large scale at all times The shift was reasonable made necessary by the persistent military challenge from the Soviet Union and the need to protect friends and interests around the globe Read more at alankeyesakshtml Lurking Threat Of National ID Card Can Big Brother Be Stopped By Carol DevineMolin Unfortunately it appears that we are inexorably moving toward a National Identification Card system an Orwellian nightmare that would permit easy tracking and surveillance of individuals on a level once considered unimaginable Its not happening in a blatant power grab by government but in small incremental steps that nonetheless will have the same deleterious outcome Our society is slipping and sliding toward Big Brother snoopery

second amendment consider the nature of the real issue Guns are simply an instrument of function The principle that is part of our heritage is the inalienable ability for self defense This natural right does not exist because government has passed a law or grants some privilege Protecting your own life and safety is intrinsic to your very existence So why do so many people confuse gun ownership with self protection when the former is only a means while the later is an immutable right Read more at sartresartreshtml Final Attack on America The Assault on Her Christian Heritage and Values By Dorothy Anne Seese My greatest fear for the beloved America in which I was born is not from Islamic terrorists as brutal as they are in their fierce hatred The medias labeling of them as fundamentalists is quite ironic because fundamentalism is adhering to the core of ones belief system which would be an indictment of the Islam of the Quran as advocating terrorism America will never be destroyed from without whether a few planes are taken down or not The recent airport fiascos are a testimony to our hysteria rather than to the common sense alternative of arming the pilot and first officer with guns and the flight attendants with stun guns While all the airport boondoggles are wasting time and enormous amounts of money the Islamic radicals could be out purchasing

failed state with Afghanistan and the Congo as basketcase competitors Find a subclan with a savvy leader or a gang on a street corner and you have what passes for governing structure in much of

business and I have been on record opposing it for years But Im not opposed to allowing no requiring airlines to pay closer attention to passengers that fit a terrorist profile which includes national origin The problem is distinguishing between what is permissible indeed prudent behavior and what is merely bigotry As the Christmas day incident involving an Arab American Secret Service agent who was denied passage on an American Airlines makes clear its not always easy to tell the difference Racial profiling entails picking someone out for special scrutiny simply because of his race It happens when highway patrolmen pull over blacks whove committed no traffic violations for spot checks but ignore other drivers who share similar characteristics say outofstate plates or expensive cars It happens when security guards at a mall tail black customers in stores or insist on inspecting only their bags ignoring whites The underlying presumption in these cases is that blacks are more

gubernatorial frontrunner and current US Senator John Breaux announced that he would not be a candidate in the Louisiana governors race Breaux had previously been heralded as an unstoppable candidate by political pundits and at varying times appeared to be a likely contender Evidence of his early support could be found in the parking lot of the hotel where he held his press conference in which

sacrifice of innocent children killed at Herods command This Christmas has been indelibly marked by the events of Sept and the ongoing struggle against terrorism Yet it is not these evils which the

ground was beginning to shift last summer with the reemergence of machismo males or truly masculine men if you will embracing their testosteronedriven behaviors and coming back into style In a scene reminiscent of the movie Jaws eight year old Jessie Arbogast lost his arm stemming from an attack by a foot bull shark on July th of last year in Florida The young victims uncle Vance Flosenzier was there to intervene in a spectacular manner at the onset In an amazing accomplishment Flosenzier proceeded to drag that dastardly shark that carnivorous sea beast to the shore with only his bare hands and brute force for the purpose of extracting the boys arm from the sharks gut In our collective memory none of us had ever heard of such a thing being done before And everyone loved it And the Day of Infamy only generated more respect for the intrepid manly men of the working class the firefighters policemen and emergency workers who braved life and limb to rescue those at the World Trade Center

not a pence of real money to spend With these euro notes of this common currency the wire services heap praise on its successful launch The wheels of business and the mechanism of finance are all in gear to usher in this brave new world of commerce For years we have heard the benefits of the first united coinage since the Roman Empire and the elimination of the chaos of individual currencies So what will this conversion mean for Europe and the rest of the world The conclusion largely depends on what you consume from the political plate and whether you wish to place your thumb on the scale that weighs the beef The traditions of Europe are quite different from those of the original colonies when it comes to a monetary perspective With the founding of our Nation constitutional powers were enumerated regarding the nature and coinage of money Individual States were restricted from their own coinage while punishment for counterfeiting was established Standard weights and measures of gold

encouraging reports on our progress and our work to defeat the recession But many workers have lost their jobs and their retirement savings when their companies went bankrupt Employees who have worked

Enron was a Texas energy company What better scenario for casting aspersions in a fishing expedition in search of official misconduct This too good to be true scenario was pounced on by David Callaway

Next week the House of Representativeswill be voting on an airline security bill that Congressman Don Young has introduced It was modeled after proposals I made last month Under the Young bill the federalgovernment will assume complete control of airport security and screening It alsogreatly expands the Federal Air Marshal program and provides substantial new fundingfor secure cockpits and

of trusting government Certainly it is important and desirable that the citizens of a nation at war have confidence and trust in their government We should be mindful however that this need for trust cuts both ways War tends necessarily to increase the concentration of power in the federal government and particularly in the executive branch In a free republic such times as war increase as well the necessity that citizens trust their own judgment Even as we willingly accept the increased energy of the government in those areas where it is truly necessary we must increase as well our vigilant insistence that government power respect the permanent principles of liberty The particular danger in times of war or crisis is that the legitimate need for energetic government action will provide cover for those who from vice or ignorance seek to expand government power at the expense of the very liberty which it is governments purpose to secure Read more at alankeyesakshtml Torturing Terrorists For Information By Carol DevineMolin Recent media reports indicate that the FBI is frustrated noting difficulties in extracting information from approximately suspected terrorists that remain in custody pursuant to the September th Day of Infamy Among the many zippedmouthed individuals there is detainee Zacarias Moussaoui a Moroccan national with close ties to the hijackers and allegedly key in the current investigation How should the FBI address this thorny predicament of silent suspects Interestingly the idea of resorting to torture of suspects is being publicly floated at this juncture which should give us pause This is possibly a public relations trial balloon by the government in order to calibrate American response to what may become an unsavory reality of war and to psychologically inoculate Americans before accounts begin to surface Read more at caroldevinemolincdmshtml Empowerment Not Enfeeblement The Citizen Response to Terrorism By Gregg Bish Our nation is wrapped in a deep emotionally wrought debate over controlling terrorism Nightly talk television programs are filled start to finish over individuals and organizations advocating everything from

its very frame at the stampede of good intentions and short wit directed its way It can be expected that following any trauma the public will respond with its emotions showing sharply on its sleeve

nation under God exalting and realizing the will of the Creator as each of us fulfill our unique destinies as free men and women Yet in the midst of this I am also saddened and dismayed by things I am hearing from some of my fellow citizens and from some of our allies abroad What type of thinking could conclude that the horrendous murderous act that occurred on September th can be justified in any

has it been for the last several thousand years of human history Its just more global in both impact and in news coverage For the United States and North America in general war that affects this nations home soil is new because of the isolation we enjoyed in the th century It must be remembered that war on US soil was common from the American Revolution through the War between the North and South It was conventional war even primitive compared to todays technological warfare but death is death whether by musket by nuclear weapons or by bioterrorism What we must remember is that peace at any price isnt peace and will never result in anything other than more bloodshed Cleansing practices particularly of a vanquished enemy where there has been longstanding hatred is common practice and has been since the beginning of recorded history Socalled peaceniks and the mentallymanipulated students who generally fall for the socialist line of drivel would do well to remember that the only

better track down terrorist groups Were also discussing ways to better protect all our citizens from a new threat the threat of bioterrorism America has now confirmed several different cases of

the United States may be much more evident by the time you read this Already it is clear that the scattered partially successful attempts to distribute the deadly spores have had some success in frightening millions of people who have no reasonable likelihood of being affected Some are calling for authorities to restrict or even suppress reporting of additional cases lest the fear spread or become a panic But this kind of response to adversity is incompatible with the requirements of liberty or selfgovernment The situation we must confront should make us all ask ourselves who is finally responsible for controlling our fear It is a question with serious implications for a free people Bravery is the virtue of having the right amount of fear and confidence in the face of real danger and of acting accordingly It requires reason and disciplined passions This is a combination we should know something about in the land of the free and the home of the brave Read more at alankeyesakshtml Smallpox As Bioterrorism A Major Threat Looms By Carol DevineMolin Although this nation is beset by anthrax anxiety its important to place the current threat in perspective To date only the offices of a few politicians and big media outlets appear to have been targeted by anthrax mailings And despite the apoplectic reaction from many the anthrax assault has resulted in only one death with a handful of individuals manifesting the disease and approximately forty others tested and found to exhibit asymptomatic exposure to the substance Clearly this is a form of bioterrorism with Islamic fanatics considered the prime suspects by most although some perpetrators of hoaxes and copycat activities are under investigation as well Read more at caroldevinemolincdmshtml ANTHRAX Why Such a Panic By Gregg Bish The panic over anthrax is more a sign of the times than a sign of fear at terrorist activity Listening to the news on Saturday morning TV one could come away with the notion that every other person in the US was infected with anthrax and those not infected were exposed All of the major news outlets CBS NBC ABC Fox and CNN carried at least one headline news article regarding the anthrax scare It is a sign of the times that one death less than a dozen infections and fewer than a hundred exposures would set the emotional and financial wellbeing of the nation on its ear We have forgotten much Read more at greggbishgbshtml Hijacking the Language of Terrorism By Doug Patton War is peace Freedom is slavery Ignorance is strength From the novel by George Orwell Some believe that the terror of Orwells masterful vision with its twoway telescreens installed in every home constantly reminding citizens that Big Brother is watching lay in its portrayal of the absolute totalitarian control of every citizens movements As one who deals in the nuance of language I have always found the prospect of Newspeak much more troubling Newspeak was an entire language Orwell created for the construction of the world of Instead of evolving as most language does Newspeak devolved with each passing year until words once taken for granted no longer existed had been replaced by something entirely different or completely opposite in meaning or had no meaning at all Hence the slogan War is peacefreedom is slaveryignorance is strength Over the last twenty years political correctness has brought Newspeak to our modern world Many of us viewed it as mere silliness or a passing fad No more Newspeak has come with a vengeance to America and to its war on terror Read more at

over Billion Dollars for New York City alone we are in store for some major realignments in the national economy The federal government will subsidize and grant a large portion of these funds Coming out of our pockets is nothing new for most of us But the underlying changes to the functions of the Capitalistic order may well be much more significant in the long run First it needs to be noted that the economic system that now goes under the so called title of Capitalism no longer conforms to even an expanded definition of Free Enterprise The reality of economic life in the United States can best be understood as an alliance of the CorporationsMoneyInterestGovernment Axis The central structures that serve as the positional referent is the nature of this axis The beneficiaries of this confederation are owners managers employees investment bankers security brokers speculators investors politicians bureaucrats judges and lawyers Their degrees of benefit are not equal but each has a vestige interest in protecting the functions of the present status quo Resistance to meaningful reform or fundamental realignment is at the core of most policy decisions Read more at sartresartreshtml

How can we go about our daily lives as the president rightly instructs us when every hour seems to bring new stories of yet another possible exposure to anthrax or a government warning that further attacks on the United States or American interests abroad may be imminent Worst of all with hour cable television it is possible to spend virtually all our waking hours being bombarded with breaking news much of which later turns out not to be true or at least not quite what it seemed at first Is watching this stuff hour after hour any different than watching game shows or soap operas all day

against Taliban targets have been preaching that nothing good will come out of bombing Afghanistan The President and other departments of the Federal government have already warned the nation that new

we will never hear from him again Richard Littiken Bravo Horowitz Noam Chomsky has been a left wing know it all for many years As a young student many years ago I remember reading his silly socialist leanings and hearing the professors rave about Chomskys analysis What is clear is that the world has once again tried to paint the USA as the evil doers and the international business community as

Chernin Rogoff Thank you Bonnie Rogoff for speaking out on truths We all need to raise the volume for we are all that is left to be heard We must retake the principals of the Republican Party and unmerge the right from the left Your article is a beginning step in the right direction Judith Pratt OK I have to say that I agree that abortion is wrong and anyone who does so is a murderer However I believe that President Bush is doing the best he can and his ability is a great one I think he is just waiting for the right time to pick up the prolife issue again He doesnt want to endanger reelection and playing nice to the moderates and liberals will help him get reelected and then he can start really putting the prolife message out Tony Lemaster Hats off to Bonnie for having the courage to say we should cut off W for his shameful pandering to the leftist media by shunning the Republican prolife platform In the time since thousands were killed by the terrorists on how many thousands of unborns have been killed with the passive blessing of the establishment GOP with Bush and Ashcroft not lifting a finger to protect them Don Zimmerman Its about time that Abortion is removed from the political process While I am not an advocate of abortion I do not believe that it is a Political concern Antiabortionists within the Republican Party do not represent me and I AM A REPUBLICAN I demonstrate that with my time my talents my service and my money Dorothy Danfelser Elephant Butte NM Thank you for the wonderful article about the GOP abandoning the ProLife Platform Ive been very disappointed in the straddling the fence posture that President George W Bush has taken I do not doubt his beliefs for the unborn and the value of their life I do doubt his wisdom in ignoring and brushing aside the prolife conservatives who made his election to the Presidency possible Cheryl Williams Edmond OK If the Republican Party does not recognize that there are thousands of us ProChoice Republicans it will risk losing its ability to win There are too many other issues that need Republican principles that dividing the party is a disservice to the nation Rep Harry Tipton

nail on the head Keep up the good work Michael Thompson Republican for Congress Ms Seese misses the point with her moral fantasies about sex It is suffering human death and other warrelated activities that are immoral particularly when the victims are women and children War is probably a nonnatural activity since primitive huntergatherers did not engage in warfare with organized armies Sex and

has effectively dispelled any lingering doubts regarding his ability to lead this great nation especially in light of his overall handling of the profound crisis foisted upon us by the forces of terror Clearly Bushs actions on the national security and war fronts have earned him significant backing from the American people as demonstrated by his approval ratings that have remained in the high bracket He is well appreciated by the American people as is his wartime consiglieri Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld But what sets Bush apart as an outstanding leader Bush is a visionary a man with a remarkable plan that will significantly safeguard the citizenry over the long haul He is determined to strategically orchestrate all that must be done in order to guarantee the safety and security of the American people not just for the immediate future but for several generations to come Yes President Bush and his resolute team have set out to accomplish a monumental mission which will generate tremendous positive impact Unlike Clinton who was primarily focused upon the shortterm economy his own public travails and excessive attempts to broker an all but impossible deal between the Israelis and Palestinians Bush understands that his primary responsibility as president is to protect the American people both at home and abroad plain and simple Read more at

war on terrorism proved an unexpected tonic for education reform The Post cites a White House aide who said I think congressional education negotiators saw it as a way they could demonstrate to the country that Congress had not been immobilized Apparently the nation lives in fear that terrorists will intimidate the peoples representatives away from the now rapidly resuming task of federal overreaching executed in the name of reform Take heart oh people Our politicians will not be dissuaded from expanding state power at the expense of liberty There are those of course who would rank a mobilized Congress high on the list of terrorizing sights Heaven help us when Ted Kennedy partners with compassionate conservatives in issuing marching orders for the education bureaucracy to leave no child behind War tends to increase national governmental power not only in matters directly related to the conflict but also in vastly broader realms of our common life In a season of national pride and solidarity advocates of expanded government power tend to find rich fields offering targets of opportunity Education is such a field and in the legislation passed last week it has received a direct hit Read more at alankeyesakshtml Beneath the News Lies the Real Problems By Dorothy Anne Seese Bombs on airplanes make sensational headlines The tanking economy doesnt And thats exactly how
