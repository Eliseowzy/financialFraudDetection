Senate appropriators are moving forward on FY funding of key Department of Education math and science education improvement programs However their respective appropriations bills vary significantly on specific funding levels Last year funding for these programs was contained in the Eisenhower programs million budget to fund teacher professional development with million set aside specifically for professional development in math and science The current years budget eliminates the Eisenhower program and consolidates teacher professional development into a broader category called Teacher Quality Within the Teacher Quality category is a new initiative the Math and Science Partnerships which will provide competitive grants to partnerships of university departments state education agencies local school districts and others to improve math and science education through professional development and other activities For FY the House appropriation would provide between million and million for the partnership initiative compared with only million in the Senate appropriation The difference will be settled by a HouseSenate conference For additional information on K science math engineering and

Raymond Orbach Chancellor at UC Riverside is Named APPROPRIATION BILLS WRAPPED UP When President Bush issued his proposed fiscal year budget to Congress last April investment in research and development was not a top priority in most federal agencies Eight months and a major terrorist attack later Congress and the President agreed to put aside their disagreements over funding levels for most federal programs until another day Here is a brief summary of how energy and space research programs fared in the recent appropriations cycle Information on funding for research programs at the National Science Foundation the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Department of Defense will appear in Update next week Energy Funding for energy research and development programs are divided between two appropriations bills Energy Water and Interior The Energy Committee of ASMEs Council on Engineering submitted testimony last spring on the energy programs contained in both bills Copies of the testimony are available at gricpshtml and gricpshtml The Interior bill provides funding for fossil energy and energy conservation RD programs In its testimony to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees the COE Energy Committee recommended several key areas that it believed merited increases above the Presidents request In all of those areas carbon sequestration advanced gas turbines and fuel cell research Congress ultimately supported the ASME Committees recommendations For carbon sequestration the President had requested million the ASME Committee had recommended million and Congress ultimately appropriated million The President had proposed eliminating the advanced gas turbine program the Committee had recommended that funding be restored to a level of million million more than in FY Congress decided on a level of million For fuel cell research the administration had proposed million a reduction of million from the FY level The ASME Energy Committee had recommended million and Congress appropriated which was higher than either the House or the Senate had recommended in their individual bills In the Energy Water appropriations bill renewable energy research funding was set at million which while million less than the Senate bill was million above the Housepassed number million above the Presidents request and million above current levels Nuclear Energy Research received million which is million more than the Presidents request but million less than current levels The Nuclear Energy Research Initiative received million

is a million or percent reduction from last year Congress is increasingly concerned about cost overruns on the station and has been highly critical of NASAs management of the project Among programs receiving substantial increases were AeroSpace Technology which received a percent million increase for a total of billion and Space Science which received billion million or percent more than last year MATH AND SCIENCE PARTNERSHIPS AT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND NSF When President Bush announced his education plan last February he proposed a Math and Science Partnership Initiative at the National Science Foundation emphasizing a need for better science and mathematics education across the country Possible partners for the Math and Science Partnerships could include the State Education Agency a math science or engineering department of an institution of higher education a high need Local Education Agency businesses and nonprofit and forprofit groups of demonstrated effectiveness The House and Senate Education Committees when drafting their education legislation also thought the Math and Science Partnership program was needed but placed the program at the Department of Education In the end now that the authorization and appropriation process is complete there are programs at both NSF and Department of Education The two agencies are in fact forming a task force to address the issue The FY LaborHHSEducation appropriations conferees only appropriated million for the newlyestablished Math and Science Partnerships at the Department of Education which were authorized at million in the recently approved Elementary and Secondary Education Authorization Act However the FY VAHUD appropriations bill provided another million for similar partnerships to be awarded by NSF In addition the LaborHHSEducation conferees encouraged states to continue making science and math instruction a high priority by also using other federal funds available for teacher improvement A total
