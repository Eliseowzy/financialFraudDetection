profitloss M EPS diluted Commenting on the guidance Mel Morris CEO and Founder of uDatecom inc s aid We have made significant progress this year Our acquisition of Kiss com has been very successful adding significant critical mass and helping u s become the nd largest business in the sector Our growth this year has m ade us a formidable contender for the number one slot during As our b usiness model becomes more established it is our belief that the business w ill reach an EBITDA to Revenue margin of around Today we have around paying subscribers the market leader Matchc om owned by Ticketmaster had approximately subscribers at the end o f September This year it is our understanding that uDate Match and m any of the other top businesses in this sector have experienced good to strong growth in subscribers The absence of any significant competitive pr essures and the perception that the growth is accelerating in absolute term s leads us to conclude that the market sector as a whole is growing at a si gnificant rate Our guidance figures indicate that our subscriber base will be around by December by December and by December This is a sector where the size of subscriber base has significant impact on a companys ability to grow the business and achieve profitability Many companies who have entered this space have failed to achieve critical mass andor profitability Examples include well financed startups like Social Net who raised around M Recently Yahoocom launched a subscription bas ed personals service However in preparation for this Yahoo rejected adver tising orders from competitive Online Personals services including uDate fr om the early in July This has had little tangible impact on the growt h of our business as advertising contracts were easily replaced with equal or better performing channels The market should also recognize that Yahoo had been operating in this market sector for a long time offering a free se rvice Their move to a subscription based model was therefore welcomed There are a number of key factors driving growth in this sector including greater awareness of Online Personals and better understanding of what it i s and is not repeat users returning to Online Personals when a relationshi p ends greater critical mass of the top services leading to a more success ful and compelling experience greater acceptance of online subscription se rvices and improved use and availability of PC and digital camera technolo gy We believe the market has very significant potential for growth Morri s concluded Q Teleconference
