description change In order to get around the wording on the Jan product how about if it states The Valuation Date for each Determination Period shall be the first Business Day of such Determination

Steve Dale CT AM To Steve NRON cc Melba CT Robert B CT Subject Re EOL description change The last line in the first paragraph which is the Product Type description states that the The Payment Date is the Valuation Date This was written specifically to be able to handle daylong and monthlong transactions as the Index states that the Valuation Date is that last day of each Determination Period That being the case the language being proposed would alter the operation of Valuation Dates as they relate to monthlong transactions so we should not make the change Dale Steve NRON AM To Dale CT cc Melba

shall be the date submitted by the counterparty When is this date being submitted and how is this submission taking place Please investigate this I would think that i if the Valuation Date of the transaction is unknown on Trade Date then the integrity of the economics of the deal hasnt been established and ii if this requires a followup phone call after the trade is done on EOL the point and

description change In order to get around the wording on the Jan product how about if it states The Valuation Date for each Determination Period shall be the first Business Day of such Determination Period This way the determination period is still one calender month and instead of the payment being the last day it will be the first day of the month Let me know if you think this will work Thanks Steve Dale CT AM To Steve NRON cc Melba CT Robert B CT Subject Re EOL description change The last line in the first paragraph which is the Product Type description states that the The Payment Date is the Valuation Date This was written specifically to be able to handle daylong and monthlong transactions as the Index states that the Valuation Date is that last day of each Determination Period That being the case the language being proposed would alter the operation of Valuation Dates as they relate to monthlong transactions so we should not make the change Dale Steve NRON AM To Dale CT cc Melba CT Robert B CT Subject Re EOL description change The valuation date is agreed upon on the point and click because the product is a Jan product That is the settlement date for the transaction Steve Dale CT AM To Steve nron Robert B CT Melba CT cc William CT Subject EOL description change I am forwarding this to Rob and Melba who will assist you with this as I am no longer involved in the daytoday work regarding the development of Products for EnronOnline RobMelbaSteve One question comes to mind immediately the suggested language states The Valuation Date for each Determination Period shall be the date submitted by the counterparty When is this date being submitted and how is this submission taking place Please investigate this I would think that i if the Valuation Date of the transaction is unknown on Trade Date then the integrity of the economics of the deal hasnt been established and ii if this requires a followup phone call after the trade is done on EOL the point and click trading isnt accomplished Dale Forwarded by Dale NeunerHOUECT on AM Steve NRON PM To Dale CT cc William CT Subject EOL description change Dale Below are proposed descriptions of two EOL products

answers our question Lets go ahead and get it through legal Savita Original Message From Crandall Sean SentWednesday October PM ToPuthigai Savita SubjectRE Day Ahead Financial ParkingLending product You are right There are no deliveryscheduling obligations on the day ahe ad DART product unlike the regular dayahead Yes A DART onpeak would mean delivery on all onpeak hours for the corresponding day and a DART off peak would mean delivery on all offpeak hours for the corresponding day Original Message From Puthigai Savita SentWednesday October AM ToCrandall Sean CcMeredith Kevin SubjectFW Day Ahead Financial ParkingLending product Hi Sean Im trying to understand the mechanics of this product If I understand cor rectly the only difference between day ahead and the DART product is that i t does not get scheduled for delivery until the delivery day Also a DART t rade for the rd would mean delivery for all peak hours on the rd Savita Original Message From Meredith Kevin SentWednesday October PM ToPuthigai Savita SubjectFW Day Ahead Financial ParkingLending product What are your thoughts on this Original Message From Crandall Sean SentTuesday October PM ToMeredith Kevin SubjectRE Day Ahead Financial ParkingLending product Kevin My apologies for not getting back sooner but I sort of wanted to see how t he Enron realtime products did before proceeding with this It seems like realtime is a success so lets get going with this I call this product DART DayAheadRealTime Its basically a physical product that is transacted on a dayahead cash basis but is delivered on r ealtime For example on the dayahead lets say I post a US Pwr Phy Fir m MidC Peak Oct to Oct DART at If I get hit then the par ty selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct th realtime MW each h our I would be long realtime at If a party lifts my then I wo uld be obligated to deliver to them on Oct realtime MW each hour I would be short at The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular dayahead cash transacti on The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow su ch that they would not get mixed with our regular dayahead transactions th at needed to be prescheduled As far as the product language goes I think if you add the following langu age to what you provided below we should be OK obviously subject to legal review This product is intended to be transacted on a DayAhead basis for delive ry on a RealTime basis Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day of delivery consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices Realt ime means the actual Delivery Day Realtime deliveries shall be consisten t with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices Take a look give me a call Thanks Original Message From Meredith Kevin SentMonday September

we currently have for the MidC p hysical product so I can work with it I dont have an electronic copy Thanks Original Message From Meredith Kevin SentThursday September AM ToCrandall Sean SubjectRE Day Ahead Financial ParkingLending product I am the one to talk with about this new product I will call you today to discuss Kevin Original Message From Crandall Sean SentWednesday September PM ToMeredith Kevin CcBelden Tim Scholtes Diana Alonso Tom SubjectDay Ahead Financial ParkingLending product Ive had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL l egal and contracts people thinking about Its kind of a weird product bu t I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was Its called the Day AheadRealTime ParkLend product Essentially its a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time For exampl e lets say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us MW onpeak for but tha t it is not prescheduledit is to be settled real time If we fast forwar d to realtime Morgan Stanley has two options They can buy from us on EO L whereby this transaction books out or they can deliver us physical powe r whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time The nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a pos ition to real time even if they are not a control area In addition it w ould provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a dayahead posi tion Kevin Im not sure if its you I need to talk to about this but I would a ppreciate some direction if its somebody else Once we identify who we ne ed to look at this Id like to set up a conference call to discuss contrac t language and EOL mechanics Thanks
