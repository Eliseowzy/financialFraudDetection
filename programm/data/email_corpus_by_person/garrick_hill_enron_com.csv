based on PPEENAs net purchase price and outstanding projectlevel debt was kW this value reflects fullycontracted cash flow under the terms of the existing PPA As a pure merchant plant the value might range from kW ie the scrap value based on a view that the margins realized from running the plant are insufficient to warrant keeping the doors open to kW based on a view that the plant runs x and achieves prices at levels forecasted by Pace Global Energy Pace in a study that we had completed to facilitate commercial discussions with Brazos earlier this year The attached slide will give you a feel for where PPA prices are relative to market prices again using Paces numbers to illustrate market ENAs ERCOT x curve is probably higher at the front end and lower on the back end than what we see from Pace reflecting at the front end what were seeing in todays gas forward markets ie higher prices than Pace predicts from an econometrics point of view and at the back end lower overall inflation In general I think its safe to say that we see the spread between PPA and market prices widening especially in light of the fact that current gas market conditions narrow the spread considerably during the period of time in which a Brazos breach is most likely Based on the facilitation material weve seen it appears that Brazos will argue that its staff was lead to believe that Tenaska IV would earn no more than return on equity However weve always viewed this as a somewhat disingenuous line of argument because Brazos has gone on public record as saying that it looked at a number of competing solutions to meet its members needs and chose the least cost alternative in contracting with Tenaska IV In fact the allin price projections weve seen in correspondence between Tenaska IV and Brazos in the contracting process appear to be in line with actual results To the extent the project has earned a return in excess of this can generally be attributed to the cost savings realized in construction and strict enforcement of the contract Its also important to note that Tenaska IV took on all of the development risk in this project it could have easily underbudgeted costs and found itself earning significantly less See the historical perspective that follows the forward projections contained in the attached We generally agree that Brazos has not been harmed by the current contract to date but is in an abovemarket contract on a going forward basis Brazos appears to have three options at the end of the primary term walk away purchase the plant for PV of future capacity payments or live with the contract by paying scheduled contract prices ie capacity charges and gas agency fees plus operating costs If Brazos selects options or Tenaska IV has certain putback rights but the plant is generally Brazos for the taking These provisions of the PPA should yield prices that are below prevailing market prices in most years ie other than those in which major maintenance will occur as illustrated in the attached Accordingly we view the contract as more of an accelerated payment plant that front end loads capital recovery to Tenaska IV Patton Boggs argument puts a new

page of the attached to illustrate pricing that was presented to Brazos and its advisor Merril Lynch during the period of time leading up to the PPAs signing on November Youll see that actual results to date have been in line with were costs were expected to be under the contract We have a one page document that appears to be part of a larger Brazos document that indicates that Brazos looked at competing alternatives to the Tenaska IV plant including one Enron alternative The document is datestamped December and may be part of an integrated resource plan or another regulatory filing required in the State of Texas Robin Kittel in our Austin TX office is looking into its source and is trying to find any other regulatory filings in which Brazos represented that it viewed Tenaska IV as its least cost alternative at the point in time it entered into the contract I dont expect well have this information prior to Friday These points aside there is nothing in the contract that ties pricing or performance to returns realized by Tenaska IV The issue of fairness is one that Brazos seems to be emotionally attached to without basis under the contract One item to note in the fraudulent inducement arena the last commercial exchanges made between Tenaska IV and Brazos prior to the June transaction indicate that Brazos may have raised some concerns over incentives that may have been provided to the Brazos staff closest to the transaction After discussions with Tenaska Inc and review of the facilitation material weve identified the source of these concerns to be a dove hunting trip that was planned during the summer of and taken November through just after the PPAs signing The point person for Brazos and Tenaskas CEO lead developer and another Tenaska employee took the trip

based on PPEENAs net purchase price and outstanding projectlevel debt was kW this value reflects fullycontracted cash flow under the terms of the existing PPA As a pure merchant plant the value might range from kW ie the scrap value based on a view that the margins realized from running the plant are insufficient to warrant keeping the doors open to kW based on a view that the plant runs x and achieves prices at levels forecasted by Pace Global Energy Pace in a study that we had completed to facilitate commercial discussions with Brazos earlier this year The attached slide will give you a feel for where PPA prices are relative to market prices again using Paces numbers to illustrate market ENAs ERCOT x curve is probably higher at the front end and lower on the back end than what we see from Pace reflecting at the front end what were seeing in todays gas forward markets ie higher prices than Pace predicts from an econometrics point of view and at the back end lower overall inflation In general I think its safe to say that we see the spread between PPA and market prices widening especially in light of the fact that current gas market conditions narrow the spread considerably during the period of time in which a Brazos breach is most likely Based on the facilitation material weve seen it appears that Brazos will argue that its staff was lead to believe that Tenaska IV would earn no more than return on equity However weve always viewed this as a somewhat disingenuous line of argument because Brazos has gone on public record as saying that it looked at a number of competing solutions to meet its members needs and chose the least cost alternative in contracting with Tenaska IV In fact the allin price projections weve seen in correspondence between Tenaska IV and Brazos in the contracting process appear to be in line with actual results To the extent the project has earned a return in excess of this can generally be attributed to the cost savings realized in construction and strict enforcement of the contract Its also important to note that Tenaska IV took on all of the development risk in this project it could have easily underbudgeted costs and found itself earning significantly less See the historical perspective that follows the forward projections contained in the attached We generally agree that Brazos has not been harmed by the current contract to date but is in an abovemarket contract on a going forward basis Brazos appears to have three options at the end of the primary term walk away purchase the plant for PV of future capacity payments or live with the contract by paying scheduled contract prices ie capacity charges and gas agency fees plus operating costs If Brazos selects options or Tenaska IV has certain putback rights but the plant is generally Brazos for the taking These provisions of the PPA should yield prices that are below prevailing market prices in most years ie other than those in which major maintenance will occur as illustrated in the attached Accordingly we view the contract as more of an accelerated payment plant that front end loads capital recovery to Tenaska IV Patton Boggs argument puts a new

page of the attached to illustrate pricing that was presented to Brazos and its advisor Merril Lynch during the period of time leading up to the PPAs signing on November Youll see that actual results to date have been in line with were costs were expected to be under the contract We have a one page document that appears to be part of a larger Brazos document that indicates that Brazos looked at competing alternatives to the Tenaska IV plant including one Enron alternative The document is datestamped December and may be part of an integrated resource plan or another regulatory filing required in the State of Texas Robin Kittel in our Austin TX office is looking into its source and is trying to find any other regulatory filings in which Brazos represented that it viewed Tenaska IV as its least cost alternative at the point in time it entered into the contract I dont expect well have this information prior to Friday These points aside there is nothing in the contract that ties pricing or performance to returns realized by Tenaska IV The issue of fairness is one that Brazos seems to be emotionally attached to without basis under the contract One item to note in the fraudulent inducement arena the last commercial exchanges made between Tenaska IV and Brazos prior to the June transaction indicate that Brazos may have raised some concerns over incentives that may have been provided to the Brazos staff closest to the transaction After discussions with Tenaska Inc and review of the facilitation material weve identified the source of these concerns to be a dove hunting trip that was planned during the summer of and taken November through just after the PPAs signing The point person for Brazos and Tenaskas CEO lead developer and another Tenaska employee took the trip
