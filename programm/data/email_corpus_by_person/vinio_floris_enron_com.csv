New York So far we are covering the three main billing scenarios UDCbill ready UDCrate ready and ESCObill ready that we may choose and switch as needed EDI billing is not ready yet but we expect having it implemented testing included at the most by May Ill keep you posted on the latest developments Let me know if you need any questions Thanks Vinio Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Wednesday November AM To Floris Vinio Ogenyi Gloria Montovano Steve Cc Kingerski Harry Subject FW Enrons Security Review We need to ensure that the EDI rules are final and allow Enron to switch billing options early next year see below Let me know if there are any issues Jim Original Message From Ogenyi Gloria Sent Tuesday November AM To Gahn Scott Dietrich Janet Cc Bertasi Ron Kingerski Harry Steffes James D Subject RE Enrons Security Review The deposit will be in the form of a cash deposit wired into ConEds Chase Manhattan Bank today I am working with ConEd to agree on the applicable interest rate We can dispute ConEds data However I do not think this is a good time to do so because Unlike our calc the ConEd calc is based on the summer peak for the customers even when we factor that in I think that the volumes used in ConEds calc may still be too high but I intend to raise that issue at a later time The number of customers EES has contracted as at today unknown to ConEd and who will soon be enrolled with ConEd makes any argument unecessary Per the UBP rules if the volumes increase by ConEd is entitled to request an increase in the deposit amount Whenever they come back to us for more we will dispute their data and hopefully reduce the dollar amount andor at least buy ourselves more time More time is important as the EDI rules in NY will be complete first quater of next year At that time EES will change its billing option the security requirement will be unecessary and our deposit will be returned to us with interest I had negotiated with ConEd to suspend their billing cycle on our customers to give us time to work through this issue This has revenue implications for them Disputing their numbers will appear as a gimmick would generate bad will and will frustrate our future negotiationsrelationship with them I will provide an update later in the day Thanks Gloria Original Message From Gahn Scott Sent Monday November PM To Dietrich Janet Cc Ogenyi Gloria Bertasi Ron Subject RE Enrons Security Review I was told Bradford would release the million tomorrow I dont know what form I will find out Also regarding the usage I do not know the answer Our numbers are systematically scraped directly off the ConEd website by account I do not believe that any errors in this process could be consistently that low We pull actual data and site profile normalizes and calendarizes the data Jeff probably is using the normalized info ConEd is likely using a design peak to maximize the deposit and ensure that even if we fail under design conditions they have sufficient security We could potentially use our data their web data to dispute their own calculation Gloria can we dispute ConEds calc based on the data we took from the website How tight is the approved deposit provision Original Message From Dietrich Janet Sent Monday November PM To Gahn Scott Subject FW Enrons Security Review FYI What form of security did we post the million How does this amount change over time Why do you think ConEds consumption estimates are so different than ours Original Message From Herndon Rogers Sent Monday November PM To Merola Jeff Cc Presto Kevin M Misra Narsimha Padron Juan Dietrich Janet Subject FW Enrons Security Review Jeff Excellent analysis thanks RH Original Message From Merola Jeff Sent Monday November AM To Ogenyi Gloria Cc Kingerski Harry Burrows John Herndon Rogers Subject RE Enrons Security Review Gloria The analysis performed by ConEd is based only on mass market customers with October start dates Looking at this set of customers ConEd has estimated significantly higher consumption for our customers than Origination has calculated This is shown below with the credit requirement calculated for days during the summer peak ConEd Calculation Calculation using Origination Values of accounts Peak Month MWh Peak Month Electric Day Nat Gas Day Total Day Difference Extrapolating these figures out for all mass market customers signed as of today with start dates between October and January the credit requirements would be as follows ConEd Calculation Extrapolated Calculation using Origination Values of accounts Peak Month MWh Peak Month Electric Day Nat Gas Day Total Day Difference Using either calculation shows that are security requirement will very quickly be much higher than the million currently being requested These values do not include additional mass market origination or the switching of existing financially served customers to physical service The conversion of existing financially served customers to physical service could easily add another million RAC needs to be aware that the million will be a temporary fix and that the value will be much higher in the near future Thanks Jeff Original Message From Ogenyi Gloria Sent Friday November PM To Merola Jeff Cc Kingerski Harry Subject FW Enrons Security Review Per our discussion Original Message From Lynch
