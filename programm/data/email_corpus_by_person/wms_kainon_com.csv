informative of all we have seen Very well said We wish all the best for those effected and Houston as we move through this When the dust clears Enron will be remembered as a pioneer and great corporate citizen Best Mark W Mark Shirley CPA x wwwkainoncom Enron Is History Says History By HOLMAN W JENKINS JR November Business World Back in the mids a pipeline executive called Ken Lay was fishing around for a name for his company produced by a merger of Houston Natural Gas and Omahabased InterNorth He consulted with consultants politicked with politicians and came up with a moniker The company would be called Enteron Three weeks later fed up with the wisecracks from a press that had looked up the dictionary definition of enteron n the intestine he changed the companys name again Henceforth it would be known as Enron A columnist less devoted to high standards of decorum might be tempted to extend the metaphor of the companys misbegotten name In recent weeks after all weve seen Enrons stock collapse over indigestible accounting and the emergence of dealings between the company and its senior officers that exude an odor of genuine malfeasance The evidence is far from clear but for the sake of Mr Lays reputation one hopes these missteps will prove one more case of a company fooling itself rather than setting out deliberately to defraud the markets Enron grew to be much more than a pipeline hauler of natural gas becoming the preeminent trader and marketer of all kinds of energy contracts and a vocal proponent of deregulation Now all but overnight its kaput just waiting to find out if its fate will be bankruptcy or absorption by an erstwhile rival We cannot help be put in mind of another commodity wunderkind in the s Phibro short for Philipp Brothers Hard to believe but Phibro was once a name that made grown men quiver on Wall Street Fattened by trading profits from the great commodity inflation of the s which some mistook for a permanent new age of scarcity it scooped up the Streets oldest partnership Salomon Brothers tucking it into its back pocket and renaming the combined firm PhibroSalomon Here was a powerhouse of unlimited potential investors told themselves Flash ahead to Californias electricity meltdown earlier this year Enron saw its revenues quadruple partly as a result of the inflated prices being quoted in the California market Many foresaw a new scarcity megatrend but there was no true energy shortage Posted prices on the California power exchange may have skyrocketed but the effective price was zero dollars and zero cents because the utilities had no cash to pay and politicians were thumbing their noses at piles of IOUs When prices are zero suppliers take a hike thats what economics teaches But once the state government started pumping its own cash into the market the phony posted prices plummeted and supplies became plentiful again Now California is swimming in power and nobody talks about an energy crisis anymore You can date the loss of investor confidence in Enron almost exactly to the moment when the California fiasco began to repair itself Fortune Magazine put the inaugural nail in Enrons coffin in March noting that the companys growing dependence on trading had turned it into an oilpatch version of Goldman Sachs Goldmans stock sells at a priceearnings multiple of reflecting investors wellfounded distrust of trading earnings to be reproduced reliably year after year So why the magazine asked was Enron awarded a multiple of plus Mmm Enron did yeoman service as a champion of deregulation Boss Ken Lay a believer in technology and the power of markets was a true visionary to the point of annoying people who didnt care for his air of being a man on the right side of history The moldering pipeline he took over would certainly have been an alsoran if he had not thrown Enron headlong into trading and marketing But deregulation doesnt confer permanent advantage on anybody A deregulated environment favors constant innovation and a continual upsetting of plans and strategies Add the fact that despite the California bubble there is no reason to believe energy prices wont continue their longterm relative decline as technology advances more quickly than the depletion of conventional resources Add also the likelihood that information technology will continue to lower the barriers to entry to Enrons trading business which means more competition and shrinking margins Enron begins to look a lot like Phibro The great commoditytrading machine was already running down by when it bought Salomon and Wall Street was swooning Inflation was being quelled by Paul Volcker The products that Phibro traders bought and sold were increasingly being traded transparently on electronic exchanges Four or five years ago they used to be able to take other companies to the cleaners because they knew where the market was and others didnt a trader explained With everyone knowing within a few cents where the price of any product was Phibros ability to make a profit off its superior knowledge disappeared Not only is this true of Enron but of its wouldbe bottom fisher Dynegy run by Mr Lays Houston homeboy Chuck Watson Dynegys proposed takeover of its former nemesis was hanging by a negotiation yesterday While Enron in recent years was selling hard assets and concentrating on electronic marketmaking Mr Watson was doing the opposite His big play in the Enron deal is to get his hands on the original HNGInterNorth pipeline now known as Northern Natural Gas By having both feet planted in the real business he claims his firm will be able to make a profitable sideline out of trading despite growing competition and transparency Well see Dynegy and Enron were born at the same time and of the same motive Dynegy was originally created by six pipeline companies a Washington law firm and Morgan Stanley to take advantage of new opportunities in deregulated natural gas But the gnats are already circling Gas producers who have claimed for years that the duo control too much of their fate now insist they shouldnt be allowed to merge Dont listen to the fussbudgets If this was a business in need of trustbusting Enron wouldnt have been resorting to funny accounting to make its earnings As Merrill Lynchs Donato Eassey has pointed out wholesale margins have been steadily thinning as trading becomes more transparent and competitive Wishful accounting has time and again proved the last refuge of companies whose dearly held visions were not panning out Enron prided itself on being realistic and adaptive but it failed to see that its own beliefs about the world needed overhauling It aint what you dont know that gets you in trouble its what you know for sure that aint so Mark Twain K A I N O N G R O U P Consulting Staffing Recruiting
