<17958724.1075862050327.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lbroocks@ogwb.com,2001-10-30 12:28:02,ENA v Miller Cc Dear Michelle I just finished my conference call with Liz Miller counsel for Calpine Christina Solomon and Steve Schuler Steve is cocounsel for Miller with Christina Christina had passed along to Liz the various points I made at the meeting last week so Liz was prepared to address our primary concerns She made the following points She has talked with several different people at various levels of authority in Calpines trading area and insists that Calpine treats the power grids as completely different regions strategies for which are not shared internally among those regions She asserts that how we do it at Calpine is totally different from Enron since Calpine is trading around a portfolio of assets that we own She asserted that Enron not owning power generation assets trades differently When I replied that Enron does have power generation assets she acknowledged the fact but insisted that Enrons trading style is vastly different due to the difference in emphasis vis a vis the power generation assets Liz claims that Miller works almost exclusively in Urcot sp in Texas with some participation in Entergy in Louisiana According to Liz Calpines strategies concerning these specific regions is divorced from and not related in any way with any trading Calpine does in the East or West Liz is of the opinion that Miller is not senior enough that we would be looking for what he knows He has no role whatsoever in discussing or formulating strategy for trading Miller she insists is on the receiving end only He takes orders dispatching and scheduling solely in response to orders he receives from others Liz acknowledges that were Miller in a more senior responsible position she would have the same concerns we are expressing were the tables turned Miller is so slotted however that she believes that he is not in a position to use any Enron trade secret that he might possess though she and Millers attorneys expressed doubt that he could retain any critical information that the most critical information changes on a daytoday basis We ended the conversation with the following understandings Liz will explore whether Calpine could put Miller in a nontrading function for a period of two months or so She hastened to add however that trading is the only area for which they really have any use for Miller She then suggested that she could explore putting him instead in the West I know Enron doesnt even have a western desk here I believe that any proposal she comes back with will entail his continuing in some trading function Liz will try to determine how Calpine might provide assurances acceptable to ENA that Miller is on the receiving end only as she asserts such that we would be confident that he is indeed not in a position to use any trade secrets he may remember On this point I was clear that I did not know either what level of assurance ENA would require or whether this would even be a feasible alternative I am to explore with ENA whether this additional information about Calpines difference in trading strategy and the limitations on Millers duties alleviates ENAs concerns about protection of its trade secrets Liz seems to believe that if the business people really knew the information she is giving to me they would not be concerned about the activities of this low level person Liz has asked that we reconnect later this week to exchange answers to these inquiries I look forward to discussing with you our response Thanks for your assistance Best regards Linda Broocks
