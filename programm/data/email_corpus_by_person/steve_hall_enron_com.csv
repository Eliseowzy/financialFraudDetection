ET NEW YORK May Moodys has lowered the rating on billion of State of California General Obligation bonds to Aa from Aa In addition we have lowered the rating on billion in lease revenue bonds from Aa to A The downgrade reflects increasing financial risks associated with the continuing energy crisis as well as those related to trends in the broader US and California economies The recent setback in securing legislation to provide energy purchase bridge financing threatens to compound the risks and cost of the energy crisis In addition the newly released May Revision to the Governors Budget Submission confirms the substantial revenue deterioration that is expected to emerge over the next eighteen months due to the weak high technology sector and stock market The May Revision commences what is likely to be a difficult budget debate Delay in External Energy Financing Will Continue to Erode State Financial Position To date the states general fund cash advances for power purchases total approximately billion and these advances are likely to grow very quickly in the coming months Last week the legislature passed a bill Senate Bill authorizing the issuance of billion in revenue bonds to fund future purchases and repay the General Fund for past advances Unfortunately this law will not go into effect until late summer thereby scuttling the states planned interim loan facility which would have provided temporary funding for power purchases Importantly the bridge financing would have begun the process of shifting the source of cash from the state treasury to the credit markets and ultimately to ratepayers That process is now delayed and in the interim the state treasury will continue to serve as the source of funds for power purchases Net state power purchase advances are running at the rate of over billion per month Moodys estimates that the states ending cash position will be approximately billion at June including both General Fund cash and internal borrowable resources which represents cash that can be borrowed by the General Fund beyond the end of the fiscal year This estimate takes into account expected energy purchases through June th In July and August an additional to billion could be expended from the state treasury to purchase power until external financing is secured bringing total General Fund advances for power purchases to almost billion by midAugust As a result the states cash reserves are likely to be significantly depleted by the time longterm financing can be secured The experience of the early s indicates that a substantial portion of borrowable resources serve as a source of liquidity Nevertheless Moodys still anticipates this weakened cash position will lead the state to seek external cash flow borrowing for the General Fund in the form of Revenue Anticipation Notes during reversing the trend over the last two fiscal years in which the State has not needed to borrow externally for seasonal cash flow purposes The state is expected to release refined cash projections later this week Although the states liquidity position is clearly weakening we do not view the states current financial outlook as severe enough to lower the rating to the A range And Senate Bill protects the General Fund from future energyrelated advances by stipulating that after November the amounts required for shortterm cash flow power purchases cannot exceed million in the aggregate The enacted bill further requires that such amounts be repaid from the Department of Water Resources Electric Power Fund within days These provisions provide some assurances that DWR will seek rate increases to fund its purchases when bond proceeds have been depleted We are currently assuming the states General Fund may not be fully reimbursed by the proceeds of the longterm financing as such full reimbursement would reduce the amount of bond proceeds available for future power purchases and require DWR to seek additional rate increases during Given the lack of consensus as to how to distribute the cost of power between ratepayers and the state treasury it is unclear whether additional rate increases during will be politically feasible May Revision Quantifies Expected Deterioration in Revenue Forecast As expected the May Revision to the Governors Fiscal Budget Submission revised tax revenue forecasts downward by a substantial magnitude reflecting the economic and revenue effect of the weakening economic outlook compared to that underlying the Governors January proposal In particular the weakening US economic outlook and stock market performance particularly in the technologyoriented NASDAQ market produce major changes to the income and sales tax forecasts Over the last several years the percentage of General Fund revenues attributable to capital gains and stock options has grown from approximately in fiscal to an estimated in the current fiscal year Based primarily on the downturn in the high technology sector which relies heavily on options in compensation packages and the sluggish performance of the stock market and its adverse affect on capital gains the state has reduced its tax revenue estimate for the upcoming year by approximately billion including a downward revision in the personal income tax The drop in these sources of income will also temper growth in sales tax collections for the upcoming year In total the state now expects revenues to decline by approximately billion year over year between the current fiscal year and fiscal The state has not seen year over year tax revenue declines since A number of budgetary actions taken in recent years will aid the state in adapting to the weaker revenue forecast During fiscal as well as in the January proposal for the budget included substantial nonrecurring spending items As a result the base of recurring budget demands in fiscal and beyond is lower than it otherwise would have been The governor has proposed to cancel or defer some of these items seeking to reduce General Fund spending by approximately billion as compared to the January proposal Spending cuts however do not match the revenue decline Fiscal spending is slated to drop by million year on year a drop of less than while revenues are expected to fall by during the same period Although the revenue forecast is relatively cautious the target ending balance at billion leaves little cushion for additional bad news The proposed budgetary reductions along with proposed spending levels for recurring items such as education will likely lead to prolonged budget debate in the coming weeks While such budget negotiations would not necessarily adversely affect the timing of the issuance of the longterm power bonds delay could further weaken the states fiscal position Energy Crisis Compounds Uncertainty in Economic Outlook The energy crisis will have economic as well as financial consequences that add further uncertainty to an already complex economic outlook The Governors economic forecast calls for the economy to slow through taking a similar if not more slightly pessimistic view than other economists including UCLA Economycom and the economists surveyed by the Western Blue Chip The state posted nonfarm employment gains of nearly in but the Governors forecast expects job growth to moderate to in and grow by less than in Salary and wage income growth which drives tax revenues is expected to be even weaker than employment trends The drivers of the forecasts include the outlook for the high technology sector as well as the important housing sector None of the economic forecasts explicitly quantifies the impact of the energy crisis The California economy is not heavily dependent upon energy and ranks lowest among states in terms of per capita electricity consumption The industries that drive the California economy are not heavy users of energy and it is not a major cost factor for the California industry mix However uncertainty regarding cost and availability of energy and the threat of unreliable power going forward have already damaged the states business climate reputation and longerterm growth prospects In Moodys view the forecasting techniques of the major economic services tend to underestimate the potential impact of these difficult to quantify dimensions of the energy crisis OUTLOOK Outlook Remains Negative At the moment we expect that the substantial cash resources accumulated by the State of California during the expansion of the last decade in combination with the planned longterm energy financing will enable it to avert the degree of fiscal damage that would call for the rating to fall to the A range If a reasonably cautious balanced budget is enacted and the longterm energy financing completed the state will still have reasonable margins of bondholder protection on its balance sheet However if the state or US economic outlook weakens further or if the energy financing stalls or if the enacted budget is only narrowly balanced the rating could be adjusted further While we expect that the state will be able to structure a viable longterm energy financing over the next few months substantial obstacles must be overcome to meet that goal In addition the state will need to enact a balanced budget that leaves enough cushion to accommodate the remaining economic uncertainty not captured in its cautious revenue forecast Given the recent failure to secure the supermajority necessary to enact emergency bridge energy financing legislation we expect that the budget which also requires a twothirds majority vote will also be the subject of a difficult debate

<14826150.1075859525785.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,steve.hall@enron.com,2000-11-06 08:10:00,How FERCs proposed order will affect Enron contractsa starting point for briefing Mark I thought I would open the dialogue by listing the proposed remedies and my thoughts on whether each would impact Enrons existing contracts Keep in mind that FERCs remedies for the California market are only proposals that may or may not be adopted Below I have listed all of the proposed remedies with comments next to or below each proposed remedy Eliminating requirement that the California IOUs buysell into the Cal PX The IOUs will no longer be required to sell all generation into and buy all of their requirements from the PX This will allow the IOUs to act as their own scheduling coordinator instead of using the PX as a scheduling coordinator It is expected that the IOUs will enter into more bilateral contracts I cant think of how this would affect contacts but I would suggest that if the IOUs pull out of the PX in a big way the PX market will be more thinly tradedless liquid leading to more volatile prices at the PX Penalty Charge for Load Deviations Greater Than of Actual Load If actual load deviates from its schedule by more than the ISO will impose a penalty charge of two times the ISOs real time energy cost for balancing energy twice the inc price We should review our contracts to determine if they allocate this penalty to the appropriate party Removal of the Existing ISO and PX Governing Boards Probably a good idea but I cant see how this will affect our contracts Interconnection Procedures FERC has directed the ISO to develop standard tariff provisions to facilitate the interconnection of new and existing generators seeking to increase the rated capacity of their facility in California Will this affect any contracts that the Origination group is working on Because this proposed ISOs new tariff language has yet to be written I would suggest that its effect on contracts at this time is remote Long Term Suggestions The FERC also made the following suggestions The ISO and the load serving entities in California should develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply consider alternatives to the singleprice auction eliminate the balanced schedule requirement by intergrating PX and ISO dayahead demand and supply bids into one venue develop lessintrusive market mitigation remedies ie no price caps redesign the congestion management system develop demand response programs that would allow loads to bid into the market offers to reduce demand and conform the ISO to the requirements of RTOs under Order and Order Since these are suggestions and may never materialize I do not think we need to modify our contracts at this time in response to these proposed changes Refunds FERC has said that it will not order refunds for unjust and unreasonable rates for the period before October Going forward FERC may order refunds for unjust and unreasonable rates for the period Oct through October Should we put a provision in our confirms or contracts that would make counterparties waive their rights to assert that such prices were unjust and unreasonable for that transaction Price Caps FERC has proposed a soft price cap The market clearing price would be capped at but parties can submit higher bids If a higher bid is submitted that party would be required to submit transaction information to the ISO or PX detailing the generation cost and any legitimate opportunity cost I would echo the point below about any reviewing any contracts tied to index prices How will we provide the incremental generation cost since we are only the marketer We may have to contractually require parties to provide us the information This would also raise confidentiality

over the next two years Immediate changes include the following Eliminate requirement that three utilities Pacific Gas Electric San Diego Power and SoCal Edison must sell all of their power to and buy all their power from the state Power Exchange PX Require market participants to schedule percent of their transactions in the dayahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and generation and overreliance on the ISOs realtime imbalance market to meet supply FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in excess of percent of hourly load requirements Temporary modification of the singleprice auction so bids above MWh cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders Establish independent nonstakeholder governing boards for the California Power Exchange PX and Independent System Operator ISO Create congestion management design proposal Establish generation interconnection procedures Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load and reserve requirements FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable rates during the time it will take to adopt longerterm market remedies The following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec Singleprice auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below MWh The single price would be used for all load which clears below this amount in the auction If an auction does not clear below the MWh level suppliers who choose to bid above would be paid their price bid In other words the highest bid of the day if above per MWh would no longer be the clearing price paid by all Sellers receiving above per MWh would be required to report their bids to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such bids allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and reasonable rates Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds noncompetitive conditions The potential refund

the state being placed on credit watch Calif Pwr Bond May Be Delayed Until Aug Gov Advisor Updated Friday April PMET NEW YORK Dow JonesCalifornias planned issue of billion to billion in revenue bonds to finance the states cost of buying power could be delayed until August an advisor to Gov Gray Davis said Friday The issue for now appears to be proceeding on schedule but delays could come from regulatory appeals by Californias utilities which have objected to the details of plans to service the debt with revenue collected from their ratepayers the advisor said We hope it will be done this summer said the advisor I think the state treasurer has said June It might slip to July or August The advisor said the issues timing is ultimately up to State Treasurer Phil Angelides A formal timeline for the issue hasnt been set but a spokesperson for the treasurer said Angelides June target hasnt changed That is still our operating goal the spokesperson said We have not revised those or pushed those back because of the appeals The state plans to use the revenue from the bonds to stretch out its costs of buying power in lieu of Californias hamstrung utilities and to repay the states general fund for power already purchased The state has spent billion in general fund money on power since midJanuary a number growing by more than million a day The generalfund outlays technically are loans that carry interest charges Nevertheless delays in the bond issue may bring increased pressure from those concerned about the states exposure the advisor said Californias Department of Water Resources which is handling the states power purchases will need to cover of the million megawatthours expected to be consumed by the states largest utilities in the advisor said The DWRs longterm contracts cover just over a third of that total leaving the department to buy million megawatthours of electricty of the utilities demand in the spot market the advisor said Western power for delivery this summer is trading at MWh to MWh and power for the fourth quarter is trading at MWh to MWh The DWRs spotmarket purchases will fall to in according to the Davis teams projections the advisor said As reported Angelides has said that with power prices at MWh the planned bond issue will only cover the states power purchases through September The details of the DWRs power contracts and revenue requirements however havent been released Davis advisor said they point to a much lower cost of power one that can be managed with a bond issue in the lower end of the billion to billion range and without higher rates We project the financing mechanism will actually be in surplus by the adviser said We do have the tools to moderate this If prices rise to unreasonable levels the state may opt to turn the lights out rather than pay them the adviser said At some point a decision will be made as a policy matter whether to pay the extra price or do a rolling blackout he said Outsiders are less optimistic than the state Analysts continue to question the states projections and ratings agencies have put Californias credit ratings on watch for a downgrade in light of the mounting power costs Massive wholesale power costs have already crippled the states two largest utilities which havent been able to recover billion from customers whose rates are frozen PGE Corp PCG news msgs unit Pacific Gas Electric Co filed for bankruptcylaw protection April and Edison International EIX news msgs unit Southern California Edison is insolvent Last week Southern California Edison and the DWR reached a memorandum of understanding under which the state would buy the utilitys transmission lines and help it issue bonds to recover its uncollected power costs The governors negotiators plan to submit drafts of legislation need to implement the agreement to lawmakers next week The drafts include authorization for the utilities to recover their power costs through bonds backed by a specified portion of their rates authorization for the state to buy the utilitys transmission lines and a variety of amendments to existing laws needed to facilitate the deal We will deliver the draft legislation to the Legislature early next week one of the governors legislative advisers said The MOU requires the Legislature to act by Aug but Davis hopes to get the package through in four to six weeks That may be optimistic Republicans fiercely oppose the plan as do a number of key Democrats who see it as a bailout As reported a number of lawmakers think ratepayers might be better off with Southern California Edison in bankruptcy Davis met with lawmakers this week and is talking with the Senate leadershp to put together a small team to work through the bills the legislative advisor said The governors negotiators are also in talks with lawmakers to add the measures to existing bills namely a transmissionline buyout bill introduced months ago by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton and a broader bill introduced by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg So far however the governor hasnt found a backer We are having discussions but we havent identified the vehicle or the authors at this point the legislative advisor said Lawmakers have said the terms of the states agreement with Southern California Edison will have to be altered raising another roadblook for the deal As reported Edison has said the agreement must pass as is although the governor has expressed a willingness to negotiate The governors adviser said Friday any changes would have to maintain the balance of interests struck in the MOU If the Legislature wants to improve on it it must keep that balance he said The governor doesnt want the balance to be tipped in either direction The governors negotiators began discussions Monday with Sempra Energy SRE news msgs unit San Diego Gas Electric for a similar deal but had nothing to report The parties were to meet again Friday and next week and the governor hoped to reach agreement in the next several weeks the advisor said By Andrew Dowell Dow Jones Newswires

will take at least days before the law authorizing the bond sale become effective The bridge loan is dead because the loan was contingent on the bond salesch Crisis Democrats GOP fail to agree on a billion emergency bond putting California at risk of running out of funds this fall By MIGUEL BUSTILLO JULIE TAMAKI Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTOCalifornia will not be able to reimburse state coffers the billions spent buying electricity during the energy crisis until August at the earliest which will leave the state perilously close to running out of money this fall Democrats and Republicans failed to come to terms Monday on emergency legislation that would authorize up to billion in bonds to repay the state budget leading Democrats to push forward with a lastgasp strategy The Legislatures ruling party outflanked the minority GOP by introducing an identical nonemergency measure that required only majority approval not twothirds passage It was approved by the Assembly Monday evening on a vote and is expected to receive final Senate approval Thursday Though it guarantees California taxpayers will eventually be repaid in full for electricity purchases made to supply private utilities the Democrats action carries a series of negative consequences for the state as it seeks to escape the energy crisis The nonemergency bill will take a minimum of days to become law after the special session ends effectively leaving the general fund with a massive hole as lawmakers prepare the state budget over the next two months We cant sell the bonds as quickly and will probably need a contingency budget said Assemblyman Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Keeley said lawmakers will probably have to prepare a spending plan with different levels of fundingone from July the time the next fiscal year begins to whenever the bonds are eventually sold Lawmakers may also have to consider a worstcase scenario the possibility that the bonds will not sell If investors dont buy the bonds Keeley said the situation were in is very very dire because the general fund would be repaid very very slowly State Treasurer Phil Angelides had hoped to borrow billion to partially repay the budget until bonds could be issued but lawmakers said the new legislation will make that impossible Angelides tentative deal to borrow the money from several Wall Street firms expires today The deal required authorization on the bonds because bond proceeds were to be used to repay the loan The Assembly Republicans refusal to support emergency legislation puts the states fiscal integrity at great and continuing risk and does serious harm to essential services from education to public safety to health care Angelides said in a statement The delay also means that Gov Gray Davis will fail to keep his promise to repay the budget and take the state out of the energy buying business by the end of June That is crucial because many of the contracts to purchase electricity that the Davis administration signed contain language that may make them void if financing is not secured by July If the contracts evaporate the state will be forced to buy even more power on the expensive spot market to avoid blackouts Davis plans to replenish state coffers and stop using taxpayer money on power purchases by floating a record bond issue which would be repaid by utility ratepayers out of their monthly bills But the bonds cannot be issued until the bill in question takes effect In a statement Davis also accused Republicans of obstructing the solution to the states electricity problems saying their decision to play partisan politics with the energy crisis seriously complicates the budget process and could ultimately threaten our economy So far this year California has spent more than billion from the budget buying power for the private utilities that were too financially strapped to continue doing so Most critically the measure will leave a dangerously narrow window of time for the bond to be issued so the budget could be reimbursed before state coffers begin to run dry in early fall The billion bond is expected to be the largest in American history and experts say it will require a significant sales effort The Democrats bill authorizes a slightly larger amount in case the bond issue needs to grow Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks said he will continue working with Republicans in hopes of passing legislation to authorize the bonds sooner Im still holding out an olive branch to Republicans Hertzberg said Lastly the bills final passage will kill temporarily at least hundreds of energyrelated bills now winding their way through the Legislature That is because for the bill to become law as quickly as possible Democrats would have to adjourn the current special legislative session on the energy crisis Democrats are vowing to quickly approve a host of important bills this week before the session is closed down And Davis is expected to immediately call another special session said spokesman Steve Maviglio so most of the remaining bills could be reintroduced Nonetheless the process would slow down passage of numerous measuresespecially for Republicans who may have a harder time getting their bills through both houses a second time Republicans hold only of the Assemblys seats and of the Senates seats making them a distinct minority Without question the Democrats move represents a ratcheting up of partisan politics on the energy crisis Republicans held up the initial legislation in hopes of forcing Davis and his Democratic colleagues to alter their financial plan to get the state out of the crisiseven if it meant scaling back the next state budget Davis has proposed borrowing the billion to repay the budget and cover future power purchases over the next two years which would allow his next state budget to move forward unimpeded by the crisis GOP lawmakers who are convinced that the size of the bond will need to be increased to finance Davis plan countered last week with a proposal to essentially gobble up most of the states projected surplus by writing off billion in electricity purchases and borrowing less in bonds for future power buys But Democrats balked at the Republican proposal saying California had far too many needs in education law enforcement transportation and health care to permanently spend billion on electricity Furthermore they said using taxpayer money instead of electric rates to cover power purchases would favor big business Today we take a bitter pill to fix a problem we all know needs to be fixed Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza DMerced said Times staff writers Carl Ingram and Dan Morain contributed to this story

Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesLegislation to place a windfall profits tax on sales of electricity into California will deter investments in new generation and drive power out of the state raising the risk of blackouts wholesalemarket power suppliers said Tuesday It would be totally counterproductive and prolong Californias misery for years to come said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an industry group New plants in California wouldnt get built and existing plants would cease operating There would be blackouts all day long On Monday the Senate passed by a vote of a bill to tax at sales of electricity into California above a megawatthour A separate windfall profits tax bill with a threetiered rate system is moving through the Assemblys committees and could come up for a vote in the full house later this week Electricity priced at MWh would be taxed at sales of power over MWh would be taxed at and electricity sales over MWh would be taxed at Gov Gray Davis has said he is open to the concept of windfall profits tax on electricity sold into California but hasnt said whether he supports the bills moving through the Legislature Generators said they would seriously consider scrapping plans to build muchneeded new generation in California if the measure is signed into law We do have some concerns on how the bill would affect new generation said Mirant Corp spokesman Chuck Griffin whose company is investing about million in new power plants in Northern California We have said all along that before we are able to build this generation we need to make a good assessment of the business environment in the state and the windfall profits tax is certainly a factor Tim Thuston managing director of government relations for Williams Cos said a windfall profits tax is confiscatory and the state is trying to circumvent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission I can tell you we think its a very poor idea Thuston said Im speculating but I think any time a state starts seizing profits it would deter investment in that state Duke Energy a power supplier investing more than million in new power plants in California wouldnt comment on how the tax would affect its plans Mirant following Williams lead supports shortterm regional price controls if they would bring stability to the states wholesale power market Griffin said We have expressed that we may be comfortable with some form of temporary price mitigation in order to get through this crisis Griffin said But the base prices for electricity written into the windfalltax bills are much lower than generators actual costs Ackerman said Todays gas prices are much higher than that he said Everybody would automatically sell out of state Lawmakers Unmoved Lawmakers arent overly concerned with negative implications if the measure becomes law If the price for rolling out the welcome for generators is to times more than Californians paid for power last year then we ought to build our own plants said state Sen Debra Bowen DRedondo Beach and chairwoman of the Senate energy committee The states motto is Eureka not Welcome to California please come gouge us Paul Van Dyke press secretary to state Sen Nell Soto DOntario who is sponsoring the windfall profits tax bill in the Senate said theres no evidence that leaving things the way they are now will be better California has a limited policy chest and federal energy regulators are not moving fast enough to solve the problems Van Dyke said California needs to build up its tool chest So at the end of the day whether we solve this problem through windfall profits or a negotiated agreement with the generators the bottom line is consumers cannot be gouged Davis who told

office wouldnt comment on the substance of the meeting Wednesday Wall Street analysts said the measure could have severe effects on Californias economy if it passes and will pressure generators shares as the bills move through the Legislature We expect weakness in generators shares with California exposure Dan Ford an analyst with Lehman Brothers said in a research note Tuesday A windfall profits tax bill will motivate generation developers to remove existing and new capital to other states and potentially destroy Californias already softening economy Ultimately however Ford expects the bill to be used as a bargaining chip rather than passed The tax also raises regulatory questions several lawmakers said In essence California is attempting to set wholesale power rates which are governed

ET NEW YORK May Moodys has lowered the rating on billion of State of California General Obligation bonds to Aa from Aa In addition we have lowered the rating on billion in lease revenue bonds from Aa to A The downgrade reflects increasing financial risks associated with the continuing energy crisis as well as those related to trends in the broader US and California economies The recent setback in securing legislation to provide energy purchase bridge financing threatens to compound the risks and cost of the energy crisis In addition the newly released May Revision to the Governors Budget Submission confirms the substantial revenue deterioration that is expected to emerge over the next eighteen months due to the weak high technology sector and stock market The May Revision commences what is likely to be a difficult budget debate Delay in External Energy Financing Will Continue to Erode State Financial Position To date the states general fund cash advances for power purchases total approximately billion and these advances are likely to grow very quickly in the coming months Last week the legislature passed a bill Senate Bill authorizing the issuance of billion in revenue bonds to fund future purchases and repay the General Fund for past advances Unfortunately this law will not go into effect until late summer thereby scuttling the states planned interim loan facility which would have provided temporary funding for power purchases Importantly the bridge financing would have begun the process of shifting the source of cash from the state treasury to the credit markets and ultimately to ratepayers That process is now delayed and in the interim the state treasury will continue to serve as the source of funds for power purchases Net state power purchase advances are running at the rate of over billion per month Moodys estimates that the states ending cash position will be approximately billion at June including both General Fund cash and internal borrowable resources which represents cash that can be borrowed by the General Fund beyond the end of the fiscal year This estimate takes into account expected energy purchases through June th In July and August an additional to billion could be expended from the state treasury to purchase power until external financing is secured bringing total General Fund advances for power purchases to almost billion by midAugust As a result the states cash reserves are likely to be significantly depleted by the time longterm financing can be secured The experience of the early s indicates that a substantial portion of borrowable resources serve as a source of liquidity Nevertheless Moodys still anticipates this weakened cash position will lead the state to seek external cash flow borrowing for the General Fund in the form of Revenue Anticipation Notes during reversing the trend over the last two fiscal years in which the State has not needed to borrow externally for seasonal cash flow purposes The state is expected to release refined cash projections later this week Although the states liquidity position is clearly weakening we do not view the states current financial outlook as severe enough to lower the rating to the A range And Senate Bill protects the General Fund from future energyrelated advances by stipulating that after November the amounts required for shortterm cash flow power purchases cannot exceed million in the aggregate The enacted bill further requires that such amounts be repaid from the Department of Water Resources Electric Power Fund within days These provisions provide some assurances that DWR will seek rate increases to fund its purchases when bond proceeds have been depleted We are currently assuming the states General Fund may not be fully reimbursed by the proceeds of the longterm financing as such full reimbursement would reduce the amount of bond proceeds available for future power purchases and require DWR to seek additional rate increases during Given the lack of consensus as to how to distribute the cost of power between ratepayers and the state treasury it is unclear whether additional rate increases during will be politically feasible May Revision Quantifies Expected Deterioration in Revenue Forecast As expected the May Revision to the Governors Fiscal Budget Submission revised tax revenue forecasts downward by a substantial magnitude reflecting the economic and revenue effect of the weakening economic outlook compared to that underlying the Governors January proposal In particular the weakening US economic outlook and stock market performance particularly in the technologyoriented NASDAQ market produce major changes to the income and sales tax forecasts Over the last several years the percentage of General Fund revenues attributable to capital gains and stock options has grown from approximately in fiscal to an estimated in the current fiscal year Based primarily on the downturn in the high technology sector which relies heavily on options in compensation packages and the sluggish performance of the stock market and its adverse affect on capital gains the state has reduced its tax revenue estimate for the upcoming year by approximately billion including a downward revision in the personal income tax The drop in these sources of income will also temper growth in sales tax collections for the upcoming year In total the state now expects revenues to decline by approximately billion year over year between the current fiscal year and fiscal The state has not seen year over year tax revenue declines since A number of budgetary actions taken in recent years will aid the state in adapting to the weaker revenue forecast During fiscal as well as in the January proposal for the budget included substantial nonrecurring spending items As a result the base of recurring budget demands in fiscal and beyond is lower than it otherwise would have been The governor has proposed to cancel or defer some of these items seeking to reduce General Fund spending by approximately billion as compared to the January proposal Spending cuts however do not match the revenue decline Fiscal spending is slated to drop by million year on year a drop of less than while revenues are expected to fall by during the same period Although the revenue forecast is relatively cautious the target ending balance at billion leaves little cushion for additional bad news The proposed budgetary reductions along with proposed spending levels for recurring items such as education will likely lead to prolonged budget debate in the coming weeks While such budget negotiations would not necessarily adversely affect the timing of the issuance of the longterm power bonds delay could further weaken the states fiscal position Energy Crisis Compounds Uncertainty in Economic Outlook The energy crisis will have economic as well as financial consequences that add further uncertainty to an already complex economic outlook The Governors economic forecast calls for the economy to slow through taking a similar if not more slightly pessimistic view than other economists including UCLA Economycom and the economists surveyed by the Western Blue Chip The state posted nonfarm employment gains of nearly in but the Governors forecast expects job growth to moderate to in and grow by less than in Salary and wage income growth which drives tax revenues is expected to be even weaker than employment trends The drivers of the forecasts include the outlook for the high technology sector as well as the important housing sector None of the economic forecasts explicitly quantifies the impact of the energy crisis The California economy is not heavily dependent upon energy and ranks lowest among states in terms of per capita electricity consumption The industries that drive the California economy are not heavy users of energy and it is not a major cost factor for the California industry mix However uncertainty regarding cost and availability of energy and the threat of unreliable power going forward have already damaged the states business climate reputation and longerterm growth prospects In Moodys view the forecasting techniques of the major economic services tend to underestimate the potential impact of these difficult to quantify dimensions of the energy crisis OUTLOOK Outlook Remains Negative At the moment we expect that the substantial cash resources accumulated by the State of California during the expansion of the last decade in combination with the planned longterm energy financing will enable it to avert the degree of fiscal damage that would call for the rating to fall to the A range If a reasonably cautious balanced budget is enacted and the longterm energy financing completed the state will still have reasonable margins of bondholder protection on its balance sheet However if the state or US economic outlook weakens further or if the energy financing stalls or if the enacted budget is only narrowly balanced the rating could be adjusted further While we expect that the state will be able to structure a viable longterm energy financing over the next few months substantial obstacles must be overcome to meet that goal In addition the state will need to enact a balanced budget that leaves enough cushion to accommodate the remaining economic uncertainty not captured in its cautious revenue forecast Given the recent failure to secure the supermajority necessary to enact emergency bridge energy financing legislation we expect that the budget which also requires a twothirds majority vote will also be the subject of a difficult debate

ET NEW YORK May Moodys has lowered the rating on billion of State of California General Obligation bonds to Aa from Aa In addition we have lowered the rating on billion in lease revenue bonds from Aa to A The downgrade reflects increasing financial risks associated with the continuing energy crisis as well as those related to trends in the broader US and California economies The recent setback in securing legislation to provide energy purchase bridge financing threatens to compound the risks and cost of the energy crisis In addition the newly released May Revision to the Governors Budget Submission confirms the substantial revenue deterioration that is expected to emerge over the next eighteen months due to the weak high technology sector and stock market The May Revision commences what is likely to be a difficult budget debate Delay in External Energy Financing Will Continue to Erode State Financial Position To date the states general fund cash advances for power purchases total approximately billion and these advances are likely to grow very quickly in the coming months Last week the legislature passed a bill Senate Bill authorizing the issuance of billion in revenue bonds to fund future purchases and repay the General Fund for past advances Unfortunately this law will not go into effect until late summer thereby scuttling the states planned interim loan facility which would have provided temporary funding for power purchases Importantly the bridge financing would have begun the process of shifting the source of cash from the state treasury to the credit markets and ultimately to ratepayers That process is now delayed and in the interim the state treasury will continue to serve as the source of funds for power purchases Net state power purchase advances are running at the rate of over billion per month Moodys estimates that the states ending cash position will be approximately billion at June including both General Fund cash and internal borrowable resources which represents cash that can be borrowed by the General Fund beyond the end of the fiscal year This estimate takes into account expected energy purchases through June th In July and August an additional to billion could be expended from the state treasury to purchase power until external financing is secured bringing total General Fund advances for power purchases to almost billion by midAugust As a result the states cash reserves are likely to be significantly depleted by the time longterm financing can be secured The experience of the early s indicates that a substantial portion of borrowable resources serve as a source of liquidity Nevertheless Moodys still anticipates this weakened cash position will lead the state to seek external cash flow borrowing for the General Fund in the form of Revenue Anticipation Notes during reversing the trend over the last two fiscal years in which the State has not needed to borrow externally for seasonal cash flow purposes The state is expected to release refined cash projections later this week Although the states liquidity position is clearly weakening we do not view the states current financial outlook as severe enough to lower the rating to the A range And Senate Bill protects the General Fund from future energyrelated advances by stipulating that after November the amounts required for shortterm cash flow power purchases cannot exceed million in the aggregate The enacted bill further requires that such amounts be repaid from the Department of Water Resources Electric Power Fund within days These provisions provide some assurances that DWR will seek rate increases to fund its purchases when bond proceeds have been depleted We are currently assuming the states General Fund may not be fully reimbursed by the proceeds of the longterm financing as such full reimbursement would reduce the amount of bond proceeds available for future power purchases and require DWR to seek additional rate increases during Given the lack of consensus as to how to distribute the cost of power between ratepayers and the state treasury it is unclear whether additional rate increases during will be politically feasible May Revision Quantifies Expected Deterioration in Revenue Forecast As expected the May Revision to the Governors Fiscal Budget Submission revised tax revenue forecasts downward by a substantial magnitude reflecting the economic and revenue effect of the weakening economic outlook compared to that underlying the Governors January proposal In particular the weakening US economic outlook and stock market performance particularly in the technologyoriented NASDAQ market produce major changes to the income and sales tax forecasts Over the last several years the percentage of General Fund revenues attributable to capital gains and stock options has grown from approximately in fiscal to an estimated in the current fiscal year Based primarily on the downturn in the high technology sector which relies heavily on options in compensation packages and the sluggish performance of the stock market and its adverse affect on capital gains the state has reduced its tax revenue estimate for the upcoming year by approximately billion including a downward revision in the personal income tax The drop in these sources of income will also temper growth in sales tax collections for the upcoming year In total the state now expects revenues to decline by approximately billion year over year between the current fiscal year and fiscal The state has not seen year over year tax revenue declines since A number of budgetary actions taken in recent years will aid the state in adapting to the weaker revenue forecast During fiscal as well as in the January proposal for the budget included substantial nonrecurring spending items As a result the base of recurring budget demands in fiscal and beyond is lower than it otherwise would have been The governor has proposed to cancel or defer some of these items seeking to reduce General Fund spending by approximately billion as compared to the January proposal Spending cuts however do not match the revenue decline Fiscal spending is slated to drop by million year on year a drop of less than while revenues are expected to fall by during the same period Although the revenue forecast is relatively cautious the target ending balance at billion leaves little cushion for additional bad news The proposed budgetary reductions along with proposed spending levels for recurring items such as education will likely lead to prolonged budget debate in the coming weeks While such budget negotiations would not necessarily adversely affect the timing of the issuance of the longterm power bonds delay could further weaken the states fiscal position Energy Crisis Compounds Uncertainty in Economic Outlook The energy crisis will have economic as well as financial consequences that add further uncertainty to an already complex economic outlook The Governors economic forecast calls for the economy to slow through taking a similar if not more slightly pessimistic view than other economists including UCLA Economycom and the economists surveyed by the Western Blue Chip The state posted nonfarm employment gains of nearly in but the Governors forecast expects job growth to moderate to in and grow by less than in Salary and wage income growth which drives tax revenues is expected to be even weaker than employment trends The drivers of the forecasts include the outlook for the high technology sector as well as the important housing sector None of the economic forecasts explicitly quantifies the impact of the energy crisis The California economy is not heavily dependent upon energy and ranks lowest among states in terms of per capita electricity consumption The industries that drive the California economy are not heavy users of energy and it is not a major cost factor for the California industry mix However uncertainty regarding cost and availability of energy and the threat of unreliable power going forward have already damaged the states business climate reputation and longerterm growth prospects In Moodys view the forecasting techniques of the major economic services tend to underestimate the potential impact of these difficult to quantify dimensions of the energy crisis OUTLOOK Outlook Remains Negative At the moment we expect that the substantial cash resources accumulated by the State of California during the expansion of the last decade in combination with the planned longterm energy financing will enable it to avert the degree of fiscal damage that would call for the rating to fall to the A range If a reasonably cautious balanced budget is enacted and the longterm energy financing completed the state will still have reasonable margins of bondholder protection on its balance sheet However if the state or US economic outlook weakens further or if the energy financing stalls or if the enacted budget is only narrowly balanced the rating could be adjusted further While we expect that the state will be able to structure a viable longterm energy financing over the next few months substantial obstacles must be overcome to meet that goal In addition the state will need to enact a balanced budget that leaves enough cushion to accommodate the remaining economic uncertainty not captured in its cautious revenue forecast Given the recent failure to secure the supermajority necessary to enact emergency bridge energy financing legislation we expect that the budget which also requires a twothirds majority vote will also be the subject of a difficult debate

companies Wednesday to discuss unpaid debts credit issues and the supply of power Those generators include Mirant Williams and Duke Energy At the meeting Wednesday Davis will attempt to get the generators to take a haircut on hundreds of millions of dollars of power bills owed by PGE Corp unit Pacific Gas Electric and Edison International unit Southern California Edison In exchange a person close to Davis said the governor may promise to veto the windfall profits tax bill if it reaches his desk Generators Warn Of Blackouts If Calif OKs Windfall Tax Updated Tuesday May PM ET By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesLegislation to place a windfall profits tax on sales of electricity into California will deter investments in new generation and drive power out of the state raising the risk of blackouts wholesalemarket power suppliers said Tuesday It would be totally counterproductive and prolong Californias misery for years to come said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an industry group New plants in California wouldnt get built and existing plants would cease operating There would be blackouts all day long On Monday the Senate passed by a vote of a bill to tax at sales of electricity into California above a megawatthour A separate windfall profits tax bill with a threetiered rate system is moving through the Assemblys committees and could come up for a vote in the full house later this week Electricity priced at MWh would be taxed at sales of power over MWh would be taxed at and electricity sales over MWh would be taxed at Gov Gray Davis has said he is open to the concept of windfall profits tax on electricity sold into California but hasnt said whether he supports the bills moving through the Legislature Generators said they would seriously consider scrapping plans to build muchneeded new generation in California if the measure is signed into law We do have some concerns on how the bill would affect new generation said Mirant Corp spokesman Chuck Griffin whose company is investing about million in new power plants in Northern California We have said all along that before we are able to build this generation we need to make a good assessment of the business environment in the state and the windfall profits tax is certainly a factor Tim Thuston managing director of government relations for Williams Cos said a windfall profits tax is confiscatory and the state is trying to circumvent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission I can tell you we think its a very poor idea Thuston said Im speculating but I think any time a state starts seizing profits it would deter investment in that state Duke Energy a power supplier investing more than million in new power plants in California wouldnt comment on how the tax would affect its plans Mirant following Williams lead supports shortterm regional price controls if they would bring stability to the states wholesale power market Griffin said We have expressed that we may be comfortable with some form of temporary price mitigation in order to get through this crisis Griffin said But the base prices for electricity written into the windfalltax bills are much lower than generators actual costs Ackerman said Todays gas prices are much higher than that he said Everybody would automatically sell out of state Lawmakers Unmoved Lawmakers arent overly concerned with negative implications if the measure becomes law If the price for rolling out the welcome for generators is to times more than Californians paid for power last year then we ought to build our own plants said state Sen Debra Bowen DRedondo Beach and chairwoman of the Senate energy committee The states motto is Eureka not Welcome to California please come gouge us Paul Van Dyke press secretary to state Sen Nell Soto DOntario who is sponsoring the windfall profits tax bill in the Senate said theres no evidence that leaving things the way they are now will be better California has a limited policy chest and federal energy regulators are not moving fast enough to solve the problems Van Dyke said California needs to build up its tool chest So at the end of the day whether we solve this problem through windfall profits or a negotiated agreement with the generators the bottom line is consumers cannot be gouged Davis who told

office wouldnt comment on the substance of the meeting Wednesday Wall Street analysts said the measure could have severe effects on Californias economy if it passes and will pressure generators shares as the bills move through the Legislature We expect weakness in generators shares with California exposure Dan Ford an analyst with Lehman Brothers said in a research note Tuesday A windfall profits tax bill will motivate generation developers to remove existing and new capital to other states and potentially destroy Californias already softening economy Ultimately however Ford expects the bill to be used as a bargaining chip rather than passed The tax also raises regulatory questions several lawmakers said In essence California is attempting to set wholesale power rates which are governed

will take at least days before the law authorizing the bond sale become effective The bridge loan is dead because the loan was contingent on the bond salesch Crisis Democrats GOP fail to agree on a billion emergency bond putting California at risk of running out of funds this fall By MIGUEL BUSTILLO JULIE TAMAKI Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTOCalifornia will not be able to reimburse state coffers the billions spent buying electricity during the energy crisis until August at the earliest which will leave the state perilously close to running out of money this fall Democrats and Republicans failed to come to terms Monday on emergency legislation that would authorize up to billion in bonds to repay the state budget leading Democrats to push forward with a lastgasp strategy The Legislatures ruling party outflanked the minority GOP by introducing an identical nonemergency measure that required only majority approval not twothirds passage It was approved by the Assembly Monday evening on a vote and is expected to receive final Senate approval Thursday Though it guarantees California taxpayers will eventually be repaid in full for electricity purchases made to supply private utilities the Democrats action carries a series of negative consequences for the state as it seeks to escape the energy crisis The nonemergency bill will take a minimum of days to become law after the special session ends effectively leaving the general fund with a massive hole as lawmakers prepare the state budget over the next two months We cant sell the bonds as quickly and will probably need a contingency budget said Assemblyman Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Keeley said lawmakers will probably have to prepare a spending plan with different levels of fundingone from July the time the next fiscal year begins to whenever the bonds are eventually sold Lawmakers may also have to consider a worstcase scenario the possibility that the bonds will not sell If investors dont buy the bonds Keeley said the situation were in is very very dire because the general fund would be repaid very very slowly State Treasurer Phil Angelides had hoped to borrow billion to partially repay the budget until bonds could be issued but lawmakers said the new legislation will make that impossible Angelides tentative deal to borrow the money from several Wall Street firms expires today The deal required authorization on the bonds because bond proceeds were to be used to repay the loan The Assembly Republicans refusal to support emergency legislation puts the states fiscal integrity at great and continuing risk and does serious harm to essential services from education to public safety to health care Angelides said in a statement The delay also means that Gov Gray Davis will fail to keep his promise to repay the budget and take the state out of the energy buying business by the end of June That is crucial because many of the contracts to purchase electricity that the Davis administration signed contain language that may make them void if financing is not secured by July If the contracts evaporate the state will be forced to buy even more power on the expensive spot market to avoid blackouts Davis plans to replenish state coffers and stop using taxpayer money on power purchases by floating a record bond issue which would be repaid by utility ratepayers out of their monthly bills But the bonds cannot be issued until the bill in question takes effect In a statement Davis also accused Republicans of obstructing the solution to the states electricity problems saying their decision to play partisan politics with the energy crisis seriously complicates the budget process and could ultimately threaten our economy So far this year California has spent more than billion from the budget buying power for the private utilities that were too financially strapped to continue doing so Most critically the measure will leave a dangerously narrow window of time for the bond to be issued so the budget could be reimbursed before state coffers begin to run dry in early fall The billion bond is expected to be the largest in American history and experts say it will require a significant sales effort The Democrats bill authorizes a slightly larger amount in case the bond issue needs to grow Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks said he will continue working with Republicans in hopes of passing legislation to authorize the bonds sooner Im still holding out an olive branch to Republicans Hertzberg said Lastly the bills final passage will kill temporarily at least hundreds of energyrelated bills now winding their way through the Legislature That is because for the bill to become law as quickly as possible Democrats would have to adjourn the current special legislative session on the energy crisis Democrats are vowing to quickly approve a host of important bills this week before the session is closed down And Davis is expected to immediately call another special session said spokesman Steve Maviglio so most of the remaining bills could be reintroduced Nonetheless the process would slow down passage of numerous measuresespecially for Republicans who may have a harder time getting their bills through both houses a second time Republicans hold only of the Assemblys seats and of the Senates seats making them a distinct minority Without question the Democrats move represents a ratcheting up of partisan politics on the energy crisis Republicans held up the initial legislation in hopes of forcing Davis and his Democratic colleagues to alter their financial plan to get the state out of the crisiseven if it meant scaling back the next state budget Davis has proposed borrowing the billion to repay the budget and cover future power purchases over the next two years which would allow his next state budget to move forward unimpeded by the crisis GOP lawmakers who are convinced that the size of the bond will need to be increased to finance Davis plan countered last week with a proposal to essentially gobble up most of the states projected surplus by writing off billion in electricity purchases and borrowing less in bonds for future power buys But Democrats balked at the Republican proposal saying California had far too many needs in education law enforcement transportation and health care to permanently spend billion on electricity Furthermore they said using taxpayer money instead of electric rates to cover power purchases would favor big business Today we take a bitter pill to fix a problem we all know needs to be fixed Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza DMerced said Times staff writers Carl Ingram and Dan Morain contributed to this story

<18414773.1075859537584.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,steve.hall@enron.com,2000-11-06 08:10:00,How FERCs proposed order will affect Enron contractsa starting point for briefing Mark I thought I would open the dialogue by listing the proposed remedies and my thoughts on whether each would impact Enrons existing contracts Keep in mind that FERCs remedies for the California market are only proposals that may or may not be adopted Below I have listed all of the proposed remedies with comments next to or below each proposed remedy Eliminating requirement that the California IOUs buysell into the Cal PX The IOUs will no longer be required to sell all generation into and buy all of their requirements from the PX This will allow the IOUs to act as their own scheduling coordinator instead of using the PX as a scheduling coordinator It is expected that the IOUs will enter into more bilateral contracts I cant think of how this would affect contacts but I would suggest that if the IOUs pull out of the PX in a big way the PX market will be more thinly tradedless liquid leading to more volatile prices at the PX Penalty Charge for Load Deviations Greater Than of Actual Load If actual load deviates from its schedule by more than the ISO will impose a penalty charge of two times the ISOs real time energy cost for balancing energy twice the inc price We should review our contracts to determine if they allocate this penalty to the appropriate party Removal of the Existing ISO and PX Governing Boards Probably a good idea but I cant see how this will affect our contracts Interconnection Procedures FERC has directed the ISO to develop standard tariff provisions to facilitate the interconnection of new and existing generators seeking to increase the rated capacity of their facility in California Will this affect any contracts that the Origination group is working on Because this proposed ISOs new tariff language has yet to be written I would suggest that its effect on contracts at this time is remote Long Term Suggestions The FERC also made the following suggestions The ISO and the load serving entities in California should develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply consider alternatives to the singleprice auction eliminate the balanced schedule requirement by intergrating PX and ISO dayahead demand and supply bids into one venue develop lessintrusive market mitigation remedies ie no price caps redesign the congestion management system develop demand response programs that would allow loads to bid into the market offers to reduce demand and conform the ISO to the requirements of RTOs under Order and Order Since these are suggestions and may never materialize I do not think we need to modify our contracts at this time in response to these proposed changes Refunds FERC has said that it will not order refunds for unjust and unreasonable rates for the period before October Going forward FERC may order refunds for unjust and unreasonable rates for the period Oct through October Should we put a provision in our confirms or contracts that would make counterparties waive their rights to assert that such prices were unjust and unreasonable for that transaction Price Caps FERC has proposed a soft price cap The market clearing price would be capped at but parties can submit higher bids If a higher bid is submitted that party would be required to submit transaction information to the ISO or PX detailing the generation cost and any legitimate opportunity cost I would echo the point below about any reviewing any contracts tied to index prices How will we provide the incremental generation cost since we are only the marketer We may have to contractually require parties to provide us the information This would also raise confidentiality

power market Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited WASHINGTON Nov Reuters The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday approved several actions to revamp Californias power market over the next two years Immediate changes include the following Eliminate requirement that three utilities Pacific Gas Electric San Diego Power and SoCal Edison must sell all of their power to and buy all their power from the state Power Exchange PX Require market participants to schedule percent of their transactions in the dayahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and generation and overreliance on the ISOs realtime imbalance market to meet supply FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in excess of percent of hourly load requirements Temporary modification of the singleprice auction so bids above MWh cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders Establish independent nonstakeholder governing boards for the California Power Exchange PX and Independent System Operator ISO Create congestion management design proposal Establish generation interconnection procedures Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load and reserve requirements FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable rates during the time it will take to adopt longerterm market remedies The following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec Singleprice auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below MWh The single price would be used for all load which clears below this amount in the auction If an auction does not clear below the MWh level suppliers who choose to bid above would be paid their price bid In other words the highest bid of the day if above per MWh would no longer be the clearing price paid by all Sellers receiving above per MWh would be required to report their bids to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such bids allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and reasonable rates Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds noncompetitive conditions The potential refund liability would extend the full months it would take to implement the market reforms Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

the state being placed on credit watch Calif Pwr Bond May Be Delayed Until Aug Gov Advisor Updated Friday April PMET NEW YORK Dow JonesCalifornias planned issue of billion to billion in revenue bonds to finance the states cost of buying power could be delayed until August an advisor to Gov Gray Davis said Friday The issue for now appears to be proceeding on schedule but delays could come from regulatory appeals by Californias utilities which have objected to the details of plans to service the debt with revenue collected from their ratepayers the advisor said We hope it will be done this summer said the advisor I think the state treasurer has said June It might slip to July or August The advisor said the issues timing is ultimately up to State Treasurer Phil Angelides A formal timeline for the issue hasnt been set but a spokesperson for the treasurer said Angelides June target hasnt changed That is still our operating goal the spokesperson said We have not revised those or pushed those back because of the appeals The state plans to use the revenue from the bonds to stretch out its costs of buying power in lieu of Californias hamstrung utilities and to repay the states general fund for power already purchased The state has spent billion in general fund money on power since midJanuary a number growing by more than million a day The generalfund outlays technically are loans that carry interest charges Nevertheless delays in the bond issue may bring increased pressure from those concerned about the states exposure the advisor said Californias Department of Water Resources which is handling the states power purchases will need to cover of the million megawatthours expected to be consumed by the states largest utilities in the advisor said The DWRs longterm contracts cover just over a third of that total leaving the department to buy million megawatthours of electricty of the utilities demand in the spot market the advisor said Western power for delivery this summer is trading at MWh to MWh and power for the fourth quarter is trading at MWh to MWh The DWRs spotmarket purchases will fall to in according to the Davis teams projections the advisor said As reported Angelides has said that with power prices at MWh the planned bond issue will only cover the states power purchases through September The details of the DWRs power contracts and revenue requirements however havent been released Davis advisor said they point to a much lower cost of power one that can be managed with a bond issue in the lower end of the billion to billion range and without higher rates We project the financing mechanism will actually be in surplus by the adviser said We do have the tools to moderate this If prices rise to unreasonable levels the state may opt to turn the lights out rather than pay them the adviser said At some point a decision will be made as a policy matter whether to pay the extra price or do a rolling blackout he said Outsiders are less optimistic than the state Analysts continue to question the states projections and ratings agencies have put Californias credit ratings on watch for a downgrade in light of the mounting power costs Massive wholesale power costs have already crippled the states two largest utilities which havent been able to recover billion from customers whose rates are frozen PGE Corp PCG news msgs unit Pacific Gas Electric Co filed for bankruptcylaw protection April and Edison International EIX news msgs unit Southern California Edison is insolvent Last week Southern California Edison and the DWR reached a memorandum of understanding under which the state would buy the utilitys transmission lines and help it issue bonds to recover its uncollected power costs The governors negotiators plan to submit drafts of legislation need to implement the agreement to lawmakers next week The drafts include authorization for the utilities to recover their power costs through bonds backed by a specified portion of their rates authorization for the state to buy the utilitys transmission lines and a variety of amendments to existing laws needed to facilitate the deal We will deliver the draft legislation to the Legislature early next week one of the governors legislative advisers said The MOU requires the Legislature to act by Aug but Davis hopes to get the package through in four to six weeks That may be optimistic Republicans fiercely oppose the plan as do a number of key Democrats who see it as a bailout As reported a number of lawmakers think ratepayers might be better off with Southern California Edison in bankruptcy Davis met with lawmakers this week and is talking with the Senate leadershp to put together a small team to work through the bills the legislative advisor said The governors negotiators are also in talks with lawmakers to add the measures to existing bills namely a transmissionline buyout bill introduced months ago by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton and a broader bill introduced by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg So far however the governor hasnt found a backer We are having discussions but we havent identified the vehicle or the authors at this point the legislative advisor said Lawmakers have said the terms of the states agreement with Southern California Edison will have to be altered raising another roadblook for the deal As reported Edison has said the agreement must pass as is although the governor has expressed a willingness to negotiate The governors adviser said Friday any changes would have to maintain the balance of interests struck in the MOU If the Legislature wants to improve on it it must keep that balance he said The governor doesnt want the balance to be tipped in either direction The governors negotiators

plants built in California dont ha ve to sell electricity here state lawyers conclude By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published April California cant require builders of new power plants to sell electricity here even as a tradeoff for superfast environmental review lawyers at t he state Energy Commission have concluded Their position reached despite Gov Gray Davis vow that new megawatts wi ll stay in California emerged as part of a fasttrack approval for expanding a south state power plant It comes as the agency that oversees plant licensing is whittling away at t he presumption that emergency peaking plants installed this summer will be temporary Some of the peaking plants to be used only at times of highest energy demand are now proposed to stay in place to years Both issues have bubbled up quietly during California Energy Commission reviews sometimes addressed only indirectly in staff reports This is a major public policy issue for all of California If were buildi ng these plants on an expedited basis and were not getting any electricity ou t of it why are we doing it asked William Workman Huntington Beach assistant city administrator The answer according to the Governors Office and the Energy Commission i s twofold First the plants are needed no matter what because the entire We st is power poor And second it looks like a California sales clause would violate federal interstate commerce law Were not supposed to take protectionist action against our fellow states said Bill Chamberlain chief counsel to the Energy Commission He said numerous Supreme Court decisions have held that a state cant use its regulatory powers such as permitting processes to give its residents an economic advantage Although there is no guarantee the Governors Office power plant builders and the state Environmental Protection Agency say most of the plants being rushed to life will probably end up selling to the state Department of Wate r Resources The people who are building these power plants know very well that we expe ct it to be used in California and were confident that it will be Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said CalEPA Secretary Winston Hickox said the preponderance of new peaking plants will devote their electricity to California We will do everything that we can to encourage that the energy produced as a result of our bending over backward to be accommodating is sold to California Were not there yet but I believe well get there Hickox sai d He also said the threeweek reviews of peaking plants have cut no corners i n terms of fundamental environmental standards Two of those plants scheduled for Energy Commission votes today were praise d by environmentalists as having relatively low emissions of smogforming compounds but they still were concerned by the day review If youre having a quick review a plant shouldnt be allowed to continue for more than the summer said Gail Ruderman Feuer of the Natural Resource s Defense Counsel The first peaking plant approved by the commission the United Golden Gate Project in San Mateo County was given permission to run for three years But the next two in San Diego and Palm Springs are being recommended for indefinite approval and their builder InterGen North America said it intends to keep them running for to years Theres no way affected communities can know whats going on with the processes that are so short said Sandra Spelliscy general counsel of the Planning and Conservation League I dont want to say negative things abou t that particular peaker but I think were going to wake up in six to months and realize we did a lot of stuff that we regret In Huntington Beach city officials say they are largely pleased with the fasttrack process that protected most of their major concerns over a proposal by AES to quickly revive two mothballed steam turbines at its seaside plant But a slower review process would have offered even more Workman said It would have delayed the plant for results of studies on sea life injured or killed by cooling water intakes and potential increases in ocean pollution He worries that his citys residents gave up those protections without any certainty that California will benefit from the extra megawatts AES wil l be able to crank out Huntington Beach sought a California buyer clause in the AES permit which is scheduled for an Energy Commission vote next week but it was rejected in a cryptic report that only notes the commission staff has taken no stand on t he issue AES would have opposed such a provision because it believes the Energy Commission has no authority to tell it where to sell said Aaron Thomas a manager at AES Pacific In our case there is no need to have a shotgun to our head he said AES is negotiating to sell all megawatts to the state Meanwhile the governor acknowledged what an Energy Commission report outlined last week that his goal of more megawatts online by July will not be met We have a real challenge in the early part of the summer Davis said Tuesday We do have more than megawatts coming online by late summer Usually the challenge is in August and September This year the challenge may well be in

plants built in California dont ha ve to sell electricity here state lawyers conclude By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published April California cant require builders of new power plants to sell electricity here even as a tradeoff for superfast environmental review lawyers at t he state Energy Commission have concluded Their position reached despite Gov Gray Davis vow that new megawatts wi ll stay in California emerged as part of a fasttrack approval for expanding a south state power plant It comes as the agency that oversees plant licensing is whittling away at t he presumption that emergency peaking plants installed this summer will be temporary Some of the peaking plants to be used only at times of highest energy demand are now proposed to stay in place to years Both issues have bubbled up quietly during California Energy Commission reviews sometimes addressed only indirectly in staff reports This is a major public policy issue for all of California If were buildi ng these plants on an expedited basis and were not getting any electricity ou t of it why are we doing it asked William Workman Huntington Beach assistant city administrator The answer according to the Governors Office and the Energy Commission i s twofold First the plants are needed no matter what because the entire We st is power poor And second it looks like a California sales clause would violate federal interstate commerce law Were not supposed to take protectionist action against our fellow states said Bill Chamberlain chief counsel to the Energy Commission He said numerous Supreme Court decisions have held that a state cant use its regulatory powers such as permitting processes to give its residents an economic advantage Although there is no guarantee the Governors Office power plant builders and the state Environmental Protection Agency say most of the plants being rushed to life will probably end up selling to the state Department of Wate r Resources The people who are building these power plants know very well that we expe ct it to be used in California and were confident that it will be Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said CalEPA Secretary Winston Hickox said the preponderance of new peaking plants will devote their electricity to California We will do everything that we can to encourage that the energy produced as a result of our bending over backward to be accommodating is sold to California Were not there yet but I believe well get there Hickox sai d He also said the threeweek reviews of peaking plants have cut no corners i n terms of fundamental environmental standards Two of those plants scheduled for Energy Commission votes today were praise d by environmentalists as having relatively low emissions of smogforming compounds but they still were concerned by the day review If youre having a quick review a plant shouldnt be allowed to continue for more than the summer said Gail Ruderman Feuer of the Natural Resource s Defense Counsel The first peaking plant approved by the commission the United Golden Gate Project in San Mateo County was given permission to run for three years But the next two in San Diego and Palm Springs are being recommended for indefinite approval and their builder InterGen North America said it intends to keep them running for to years Theres no way affected communities can know whats going on with the processes that are so short said Sandra Spelliscy general counsel of the Planning and Conservation League I dont want to say negative things abou t that particular peaker but I think were going to wake up in six to months and realize we did a lot of stuff that we regret In Huntington Beach city officials say they are largely pleased with the fasttrack process that protected most of their major concerns over a proposal by AES to quickly revive two mothballed steam turbines at its seaside plant But a slower review process would have offered even more Workman said It would have delayed the plant for results of studies on sea life injured or killed by cooling water intakes and potential increases in ocean pollution He worries that his citys residents gave up those protections without any certainty that California will benefit from the extra megawatts AES wil l be able to crank out Huntington Beach sought a California buyer clause in the AES permit which is scheduled for an Energy Commission vote next week but it was rejected in a cryptic report that only notes the commission staff has taken no stand on t he issue AES would have opposed such a provision because it believes the Energy Commission has no authority to tell it where to sell said Aaron Thomas a manager at AES Pacific In our case there is no need to have a shotgun to our head he said AES is negotiating to sell all megawatts to the state Meanwhile the governor acknowledged what an Energy Commission report outlined last week that his goal of more megawatts online by July will not be met We have a real challenge in the early part of the summer Davis said Tuesday We do have more than megawatts coming online by late summer Usually the challenge is in August and September This year the challenge may well be in
