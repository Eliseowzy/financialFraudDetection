surprising end of WTO I was together with Rachel Thompson of the OECD and services trade specialist Julian Arkell who have been advising our group from a European perspective So I thought I would give you my account of the final hours of the Seattle Round By the time you read this it will have been covered in great detail by the world press but as of Saturday morning only the west coast papers seem to have gotten the full story which broke around pm Seattle time Friday night I went back to the convention center about pm and as I walked up the block still cordoned off by riot police delegates were already streaming out of the building Emotions ranged from tired to disgusted to dispirited Inside a final plenary session was underway led by WTO director general Michael Moore and US host Charlene Barshefsky I watched the final moments of the plenary session on TV in the media center where journalists laughed as Moore made lame jokes about Seattle hospitality and vowed to resist pressure to step down as DG I intend to fulfill my contract Moore said I have a background of fulfilling contracts in the labor movement This was a poor choice of language since it was probably the USinfluenced attempt to launch discussions on labor standards that killed the round more than anything else Following the plenary Moore and Barshefsky held a press conference followed by another by representatives from the European Union I sat in as an observer to the two press conferences which lasted until just after am Saturday The collapse of the launch of the Seattle round is extremely significant For one thing it means that there will be no Seattle round Although Moore has been charged to come up with suggestions about restarting the process beginning early next year it is unlikely that either the political will or interest to do so will be sufficient before the US election campaign blows everything else off the calendar Relaunching the round will depend very much on the complexion of the next US Administration how committed it is to trade how much it owes to labor whether it can stand up to the environmental and labor groups that helped to derail the launch Past experience suggests that it will take several years three to four is average to organize another attempt IF there is strong political motivation The collapse seriously undermines US credibility in international economic issues There was a strong feeling that the Administration had played the WTO meeting to domestic political interests and overplayed its hand to the extent of jeopardizing the structure of the negotiations One European journalist Guy de Jonquiere FT asked Barshefsky what she thought about the common view that this was a terrible mess the worst organized conference and that the sabotage was in part deliberate or at least that failure had been seen as a political option by the US Barshefsky angrily rejected the question and defended her failure on the grounds that issues that had been intractable remained intractable Nonetheless the question expressed a general hostility towards the US as host organization based perhaps partly on the discomfort of delegates who were beaten up on their way into the convention center locked for hours on end in their hotels and forced to hide their WTO identification tags whenever they left streets belatedly cordoned off for the event Not to mention dodging protestors chaining themselves to hotel doors boarded up stores and transportation difficulties several taxi companies went on strike on Tuesday and were thin the rest of the week The failure of the Seattle round comes at a time when the other Bretton Woods institutions the IMF and World Bank are under attack as well as the WTO All three have suffered from retrenchment of US funding relentless criticism by the US Congress and waffling support from the Administration The Seattle fiasco will put more pressure on regional organizations such as the EU NAFTA FTAA APEC and ASEAN to continue to move towards liberalization and give them more reasons to move into defensive modes We can expect to hear a lot in the next months about the possible fragmentation of the global trading system into regional blocks just as we did in the late s when the Uruguay Round nearly collapsed But a drift towards regionalism may not be all bad To the extent that regional organizations themselves have a strong stake in keeping the global trading system open or at least in preserving access to major markets they may provide the momentum to continue work in some of the areas of interest to multinationals for Enron energy services environment and trade and regulatory harmonization Rachel Thompson as an observer for the OECD was in the socalled green room where negotiations shifted on Friday afternoon after the attempt to craft a ministerial declaration through working groups was abandoned This represented a return to a more traditional GATTWTO mode of horsetrading in camera or in a relatively small room as opposed to the innovative but failed US strategy of crafting a text in pieces through five working groups on agriculture market access implementation and rules systemic and other issues including competition policy investment and the environment The idea behind the working group structure was to open up the negotiating process particularly to developing countries and make it more democratic Instead it resulted in chaos Rachel said that the green room discussions fell apart about pm Friday when it became evident that the negotiators were too far apart on too many issues A crucial element she said was the outrage felt by developing countries over Clintons statements on labor rights and sanctions in an interview en route to Seattle Rachel described this as a political miscalculation similar to Clintons bungling of the China deal during the visit to the US of Chinese vice premier Zhu Rongji last March when he played At a midnight press conference US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky defended the Administrations strategy argued that the interruption to the WTO process was merely temporary and described all the agreements reached prior to the breakdown as frozen and ready to move ahead once the round was launched Barshefsky described the collapse of the talks as a timeout along the lines of previous occasions when GATT has floundered as in failure of the US to launch a services negotiation and failure to bring Uruguay Round to a conclusion as planned the Uruguay Round ended finally in Barshefsky was immediately challenged by EU commissioner Pascal Lamy who said that the proposals submitted in Seattle were dead although some of the ideas would live on What I think happened this was the fourth in a series of this kind of episode was that the delegations came they proceeded to work exceptionally hard and in good faith but were not quite willing to make political decisions Barshefsky said Lamy agreed that the issues were complex but added that the posturing of some of the actors helped block the launch He blamed the collapse partly on faulty procedure Two days ago prospects seemed brighter before the working groups were formed This is something that we do have to reflect upon But he went on to say that the WTO itself was to blame for the problems The process has to be reassessed reinvigorated refurbished and maybe rebuilt Lamy said Efficiency and transparency are common problems in modern institutions The WTO does not have the institutional strength the culture or procedures to do this right What happens next and what are the implications for Enrons effort in energy services First nothing new will happen on energy services until a new round is launched This however gives us time to work on definitional issues If the round had started as planned in March we might still be unprepared with arguments to support the broad definition of energy services we have promoted Third we will have time to build a dialogue with the EU and Japan in particular on energy services and to cultivate programs similar to the APEC work program on energy services in other regional organizations Finally although we have viewed the proposed APEC work program on energy services as weak and a distraction from WTO work this may turn out to be the strongest available vehicle to work on basic issues of definition and best practices In terms of WTO itself two streams of activity are possible maybe three First existing working groups will continue separate from the drafting committees that were set up this week The most important of these is one on domestic regulatory issues that is not timespecific according to Julian Arkell Julian describes domestic regulation and regulatory harmonization as the biggest future area of difficulty for WTO and it is also one that is directly relevant to Enrons interest in regulatory standardization in electricity and natural gas regimes globally The domestic regulatory working group has started programs on transparency necessity equivalency including harmonization and international standards Arcane as these discussions may be they have enormous ongoing importance for the rules based global trading system A second possible stream is to push ahead with the socalled builtin agenda on agriculture and services Barshefsky seemed to be arguing that the builtin agenda could go ahead regardless of the failure to launch a comprehensive round Rachel and Julian both felt this was dubious In any event it does not help energy services because this was not among the builtin service sectors A third possible stream would be separate negotiations to complete the previous services round in along the lines of the information technology agreement and proposed ITA Two Theoretically energy services could be discussed or negotiated in terms of a reference paper indicating the unique features of the sector and advancing the agenda on domestic regulation This also seems unlikely given that the question of a broader services round now overhangs any discussion in services On electronic commerce we might expect to see some different viewpoints along the lines of the basic split between Barshefsky and Lamy However Lamy said in response to a question that nothing has been agreed on ecommerce Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed The followup is probably up to the normal WTO process Once that is settled the moratorium on ecommerce taxation wouldnt be a problem and we can take the issue rapidly I may find out more during the day depending on who is still left in Seattle The Coalition of Service Industries closed its room early this morning after doing a terrific job in terms of informing its members and corralling Administration officials to give briefings We should take heart from CSIs experience It was formed in to get services on the agenda of the Uruguay Round It took four years to launch the round in then another eight years to get the first broad services agreement in This was a setback but the meetings provided an opportunity to meet some new service industry players such as

international economic issues There was a strong feeling that the Administration had played the WTO meeting to domestic political interests and overplayed its hand to the extent of jeopardizing the structure of the negotiations One European journalist Guy de Jonquiere FT asked Barshefsky what she thought about the common view that this was a terrible mess the worst organized conference and that the sabotage was in part deliberate or at least that failure had been seen as a political option by the US Barshefsky angrily rejected the question and defended her failure on the grounds that issues that had been intractable remained intractable Nonetheless the question expressed a general hostility towards the US as host organization based perhaps partly on the discomfort of delegates who were beaten up on their way into the convention center locked for hours on end in their hotels and forced to hide their WTO identification tags whenever they left streets belatedly cordoned off for the event Not to mention dodging protestors chaining themselves to hotel doors boarded up stores and transportation difficulties several taxi companies went on strike on Tuesday and were thin the rest of the week The failure of the Seattle round comes at a time when the other Bretton Woods institutions the IMF and World Bank are under attack as well as the WTO All three have suffered from retrenchment of US funding relentless criticism by the US Congress and waffling support from the Administration The Seattle fiasco will put more pressure on regional organizations such as the EU NAFTA FTAA APEC and ASEAN to continue to move towards liberalization and give them more reasons to move into defensive modes We can expect to hear a lot in the next months about the possible fragmentation of the global trading system into regional blocks just as we did in the late s when the Uruguay Round nearly collapsed But a drift towards regionalism may not be all bad To the extent that regional organizations themselves have a strong stake in keeping the global trading system open or at least in preserving access to major markets they may provide the momentum to continue work in some of the areas of interest to multinationals for Enron energy services environment and trade and regulatory harmonization Rachel Thompson as an observer for the OECD was in the socalled green room where negotiations shifted on Friday afternoon after the attempt to craft a ministerial declaration through working groups was abandoned This represented a return to a more traditional GATTWTO mode of horsetrading in camera or in a relatively small room as opposed to the innovative but failed US strategy of crafting a text in pieces through five working groups on agriculture market access implementation and rules systemic and other issues including competition policy investment and the environment The idea behind the working group structure was to open up the negotiating process particularly to developing countries and make it more democratic Instead it resulted in chaos Rachel said that the green room discussions fell apart about pm Friday when it became evident that the negotiators were too far apart on too many issues A crucial element she said was the outrage felt by developing countries over Clintons statements on labor rights and sanctions in an interview en route to Seattle Rachel described this as a political miscalculation similar to Clintons bungling of the China deal during the visit to the US of Chinese vice premier Zhu Rongji last March when he played At a midnight press conference US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky defended the Administrations strategy argued that the interruption to the WTO process was merely temporary and described all the agreements reached prior to the breakdown as frozen and ready to move ahead once the round was launched Barshefsky described the collapse of the talks as a timeout along the lines of previous occasions when GATT has floundered as in failure of the US to launch a services negotiation and failure to bring Uruguay Round to a conclusion as planned the Uruguay Round ended finally in Barshefsky was immediately challenged by EU commissioner Pascal Lamy who said that the proposals submitted in Seattle were dead although some of the ideas would live on What I think happened this was the fourth in a series of this kind of episode was that the delegations came they proceeded to work exceptionally hard and in good faith but were not quite willing to make political decisions Barshefsky said Lamy agreed that the issues were complex but added that the posturing of some of the actors helped block the launch He blamed the collapse partly on faulty procedure Two days ago prospects seemed brighter before the working groups were formed This is something that we do have to reflect upon But he went on to say that the WTO itself was to blame for the problems The process has to be reassessed reinvigorated refurbished and maybe rebuilt Lamy said Efficiency and transparency are common problems in modern institutions The WTO does not have the institutional strength the culture or procedures to do this right What happens next and what are the implications for Enrons effort in energy services First nothing new will happen on energy services until a new round is launched This however gives us time to work on definitional issues If the round had started as planned in March we might still be unprepared with arguments to support the broad definition of energy services we have promoted Third we will have time to build a dialogue with the EU and Japan in particular on energy services and to cultivate programs similar to the APEC work program on energy services in other regional organizations Finally although we have viewed the proposed APEC work program on energy services as weak and a distraction from WTO work this may turn out to be the strongest available vehicle to work on basic issues of definition and best practices In terms of WTO itself two streams of activity are possible maybe three First existing working groups will continue separate from the drafting committees that were set up this week The most important of these is one on domestic regulatory issues that is not timespecific according to Julian Arkell Julian describes domestic regulation and regulatory harmonization as the biggest future area of difficulty for WTO and it is also one that is directly relevant to Enrons interest in regulatory standardization in electricity and natural gas regimes globally The domestic regulatory working group has started programs on transparency necessity equivalency including harmonization and international standards Arcane as these discussions may be they have enormous ongoing importance for the rules based global trading system A second possible stream is to push ahead with the socalled builtin agenda on agriculture and services Barshefsky seemed to be arguing that the builtin agenda could go ahead regardless of the failure to launch a comprehensive round Rachel and Julian both felt this was dubious In any event it does not help energy services because this was not among the builtin service sectors A third possible stream would be separate negotiations to complete the previous services round in along the lines of the information technology agreement and proposed ITA Two Theoretically energy services could be discussed or negotiated in terms of a reference paper indicating the unique features of the sector and advancing the agenda on domestic regulation This also seems unlikely given that the question of a broader services round now overhangs any discussion in services On electronic commerce we might expect to see some different viewpoints along the lines of the basic split between Barshefsky and Lamy However Lamy said in response to a question that nothing has been agreed on ecommerce Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed The followup is probably up to the normal WTO process Once that is settled the moratorium on ecommerce taxation wouldnt be a problem and we can take the issue rapidly I may find out more during the day depending on who is still left in Seattle The Coalition of Service Industries closed its room early this morning after doing a terrific job in terms of informing its members and corralling Administration officials to give briefings We should take heart from CSIs experience It was formed in to get services on the agenda of the Uruguay Round It took four years to launch the round in then another eight years to get the first broad services agreement in This was a setback but the meetings provided an opportunity to meet some new service industry players such as the brand new Japan Services Network established Oct a new services industry group in Hong Kong and the European Services Forum Back to the drawing board but the drawing board itself is much bigger

<13515452.1075846394015.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,edith.terry@enron.com,1999-12-04 07:02:00,Collapse of WTO talks Cc I think I was alone among the energy services group in staying through the bitter and surprising end of WTO I was together with Rachel Thompson of the OECD and services trade specialist Julian Arkell who have been advising our group from a European perspective So I thought I would give you my account of the final hours of the Seattle Round By the time you read this it will have been covered in great detail by the world press but as of Saturday morning only the west coast papers seem to have gotten the full story which broke around pm Seattle time Friday night I went back to the convention center about pm and as I walked up the block still cordoned off by riot police delegates were already streaming out of the building Emotions ranged from tired to disgusted to dispirited Inside a final plenary session was underway led by WTO director general Michael Moore and US host Charlene Barshefsky I watched the final moments of the plenary session on TV in the media center where journalists laughed as Moore made lame jokes about Seattle hospitality and vowed to resist pressure to step down as DG I intend to fulfill my contract Moore said I have a background of fulfilling contracts in the labor movement This was a poor choice of language since it was probably the USinfluenced attempt to launch discussions on labor standards that killed the round more than anything else Following the plenary Moore and Barshefsky held a press conference followed by another by representatives from the European Union I sat in as an observer to the two press conferences which lasted until just after am Saturday The collapse of the launch of the Seattle round is extremely significant For one thing it means that there will be no Seattle round Although Moore has been charged to come up with suggestions about restarting the process beginning early next year it is unlikely that either the political will or interest to do so will be sufficient before the US election campaign blows everything else off the calendar Relaunching the round will depend very much on the complexion of the next US Administration how committed it is to trade how much it owes to labor whether it can stand up to the environmental and labor groups that helped to derail the launch Past experience suggests that it will take several years three to four is average to organize another attempt IF there is strong political motivation The collapse seriously undermines US credibility in
