Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal UBS AG the giant Swiss financial firm emerged the apparent victor to acquire Enron Corps North American energytrading operation Enron hopes the deal will breathe new life into its dormant trading business once the generator of of the Houston companys profit But obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable as indicated by the fact there were only two serious bidders UBS and Citigroup Inc Enron wouldnt see any serious money from the UBS deal for at least a year indicating how difficult it will be for the energy companys creditors to recover what they are owed Enron filed for Chapter bankruptcycourt protection on Dec the largest such filing ever shielding the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize Under the terms of the deal which is subject to bankruptcycourt approval Enron would transfer to UBS Warburg the investment banking arm of UBS its wholesale energytrading operation including a staff of roughly people and computer systems and hardware that comprised its oncemighty EnronOnline Internetbased trading platform UBS wouldnt be acquiring any of Enrons huge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound It also wouldnt provide any cash upfront to Enron Instead UBS would pay royalties to Enron amounting to onethird of the energytrading enterprises pretax profit for a year period according to Enron UBS would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the payment to Enron of money in years three four and five UBS would pay Enron times Enrons prioryear payment for each onethird share of royalty eliminated As such it could completely eliminate Enrons royalty payments by the end of the fifth year As incentive to buy out Enron UBSs royalty payments otherwise would increase by from years five through up to a maximum of share of pretax profit Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said yesterday that he felt it was a grandslam great deal for creditors since new life is being breathed into a perishable commodity Enrons staff had been kept together largely on the basis of retention bonuses that expire at the end of February The trading operation effectively suspended operations prior to Enrons Chapter filing last month Enron had hoped to bring in a creditworthy partner to take a stake in a new trading joint venture leaving the energy company with a stake But Mr McMahon said no bidder was interested in that deal There also were no bids for the trading operation from rival energy or energytrading companies One possible reason was that resuscitating Enrons vast trading business would require a top credit rating lots of capital to back trading operations and an expert creditrisk department to keep track of what traders are doing and to constantly revalue the trading book Since the Enron debacle other energytrading firms have taken pains to show they are deemphasizing commoditylike trading of electricity which Enron pioneered and are instead concentrating on selling their own output of energy products and entering into contracts to protect themselves against price volatility Mr McMahon said he feels that by virtue of a AAplus bank purchasing this business it changes the landscape of the energymerchant business forever by putting more clout in the hands of institutions with top credit ratings UBS apparently hasnt committed to provide any set level of capital There is no determination yet for how royalty payments would be divided among Enrons thousands of creditors The largest question though is whether the trading business can truly be revived Although Enrons global wholesale division which included as its biggest component the North American energytrading operations generated about billion in pretax profit during the first nine months of it has been dormant now for more than a month Martin Bienenstock Enrons lead bankruptcy lawyer characterized the deal as the sale of something that was dead that we are trying to bring back to life Competitors say they think a certain amount of Enrons trades were conducted at very thin margins in order to build volume and that such trading practice likely will disappear Youll see the churn going away says Michael McNally chief financial officer of TXU Corp now the biggest electricity trader in Texas He thinks EnronOnline has significant value but theres only a limited number of people who would know how to use it Scaled to transact trades on hundreds of types of contracts the platform is oversized for most uses UBS Warburg which bought PaineWebber in has looked to expand its US market share and the Enron deal would provide entry into energy trading John Costas chief executive of UBS Warburg said Friday the Enron unit would be a valuable extension of our worldwide trading activities The winner of the auction held under the bankruptcy courts supervision was announced shortly after noon Friday in a packed Manhattan courtroom less than an hour after the two bidders had submitted final offers Enrons advisers and its creditors committee which endorsed the UBS deal had negotiated nonstop for more than hours In addition to Citigroup which Mr McMahon said competed neck and neck with UBS BP PLC the British oil company had submitted a million bid for the computer settlement support system of the Enron unit The proposed UBS transaction is subject to approval by Judge Arthur J Gonzalez of the US Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York who officially closed the auction to new bidders Friday A hearing is set for Thursday at which creditors will have an opportunity to voice objections Separately Friday Judge Gonzalez declined to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston denying motions from several creditors who had argued that Enrons headquarters city was a more suitable venue Anita Greil contributed to this article Journal

Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc By Ken Brown Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal When Jeffrey Skilling resigned as chief executive of Enron Corp in midAugust he said he wanted to spend more time with his three children Ive missed too many soccer games over the years he told his brother Tom soon after he quit But instead of standing on the sidelines Mr Skilling stayed in the game making a big speculative stockmarket bet against an Enron rival A spokeswoman for Mr Skilling confirms that he made the wager a short sale initiated on Aug against shares of AES Corp a big energy producer A person familiar with the matter puts the trades value at million though Mr Skillings spokeswoman says the estimate is way out of the ballpark on the high side The bet came as AESs shares were tumbling and depending on when it was closed out could have netted him a profit of more than million Mr Skillings spokeswoman Judy Leone confirms he did make a profit on the trade but wont say how much or when the trade was closed out There is a category of personal financial information that were going to respect Mr Skillings privacy on Ms Leone says As CEO of Enron which made most of its money trading in the volatile energy markets Mr Skilling was used to taking on risk He pushed the company into several unproven businesses including the trading of bandwidth or network capacity a market that ultimately didnt prove successful for the Houston company Enron itself reveled in a swashbuckling attitude that ultimately contributed to its downfall the company has been under bankruptcycourt protection since early last month But a bet of this type was exceptionally risky In short sales investors borrow shares of a stock and sell them hoping the stock will fall so they can replace the shares with cheaper ones Such trades are riskier than buying a companys shares directly because if the stock rises strongly an investor with a short position on the shares can be forced to cover the bet at a skyhigh cost As it turns out AES shares along with those of other energy companies fell steadily in the month after Mr Skillings resignation Then on Sept AES stock tanked falling by nearly when the company announced it wouldnt meet analysts earnings estimates for If Mr Skilling had maintained his short bet through that date he could have earned better than on his investment AES based in Arlington Va blamed the earnings shortfall in part on the fall in the Brazilian currency AES wouldnt comment on Mr Skillings trading Commenting on another companys nowdeparted executives behavior is not a comment I think we ought to make says Kenneth Woodcock a company spokesman Mr Skillings bet raises the question about whether he knew anything special about AESs business because of his work at Enron Ms Leone his spokeswoman says Mr Skilling shorted the AES shares based on a July pageone article in The Wall Street Journal that said AES was having trouble in its big Brazilian operations and would be hurt by the fall in the Brazilian currency Based on information in the article and his general knowledge about how business in Brazil worked he felt that the companys stock might fall in price His trading decision was absolutely not based on any nonpublic information he had obtained while an Enron executive she says AES did trade energy with Enron but only a small amount and only as a way to sell its output rather than to earn a profit according to Mr Woodcock He adds that there would be no obvious way for Mr Skilling to have gained any unique or valuable knowledge about AES through Enrons dealings with his company The trade was made through Mr Skillings account at Charles Schwab Co the big discount broker and it created a buzz inside the firms San Francisco offices After the position was taken we checked up on it a couple of days later and a couple of days after that and said oh it went down says the person familiar with the trade At the time of Mr Skillings resignation Schwab executives in their newly opened privateclient office in Houston were trying to sell Mr Skilling on a plan to hedge the value of his Enron stock the person says Schwab executives in San Francisco had created an elaborate presentation for the hedging strategy called a collar but Mr Skilling never acted on it a decision that may have cost him millions the person says Mr Skilling wouldnt comment on the collar proposal At the time of his resignation on Aug the million Enron shares that Mr Skilling owned outright were worth about million He also had vested options that were in the money meaning their exercise price was below the stocks share price at the time Mr Skilling has said he sold about of the shares he owned outright on Sept when the stock market reopened following the terrorist attacks That sale would have netted him about million based on that days volatile prices His remaining shares are worth at Enrons current share price of cents and his options are worthless Just accounting for the shares he owns outright the collar proposed by Schwab could have saved Mr Skilling more than million Interestingly professional investors often will try to hedge a big positive bet on a company in any given industry by shorting shares of a rival on the theory that if the entire industry tumbles the gains on the short sale would offset the losses on the long position But Mr Skillings spokeswoman says the trade wasnt a hedge adding that it was the first and only time he made a short sale and that right now the only stock Mr Skilling owns is Enron If he thought the stock price was going down he could have sold all his Enron shares he didnt Ms Leone says Enron and Schwab which were often paired in magazine articles touting Americas most innovative companies had at least one minor business relationship Schwab had handled a small portion of Enrons k called the brokerage window which allowed employees to buy mutual funds not offered in the companys plan as well as individual stocks for their ks The relationship ended in July when Enron made some administrative changes to the plan and Schwab was replaced Mr Skilling isnt the only member of his family to suffer because of Enrons collapse His brother Tom a Chicago television weatherman bought shares of Enron at early last year because of these incredible analyst reviews of the company He says he sold them in the fall at to buy some land Little did I know if I stuck with it I would have a cent stock he says in an interview from his vacation home in Alaska He says his father suffered more He bought shares of Enron last year and still holds them You wonder what in Gods name were the analysts doing Tom Skilling says There were a lot of people lulled into I dont know what a comatose state END DOW JONES

Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal UBS AG the giant Swiss financial firm emerged the apparent victor to acquire Enron Corps North American energytrading operation Enron hopes the deal will breathe new life into its dormant trading business once the generator of of the Houston companys profit But obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable as indicated by the fact there were only two serious bidders UBS and Citigroup Inc Enron wouldnt see any serious money from the UBS deal for at least a year indicating how difficult it will be for the energy companys creditors to recover what they are owed Enron filed for Chapter bankruptcycourt protection on Dec the largest such filing ever shielding the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize Under the terms of the deal which is subject to bankruptcycourt approval Enron would transfer to UBS Warburg the investment banking arm of UBS its wholesale energytrading operation including a staff of roughly people and computer systems and hardware that comprised its oncemighty EnronOnline Internetbased trading platform UBS wouldnt be acquiring any of Enrons huge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound It also wouldnt provide any cash upfront to Enron Instead UBS would pay royalties to Enron amounting to onethird of the energytrading enterprises pretax profit for a year period according to Enron UBS would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the payment to Enron of money in years three four and five UBS would pay Enron times Enrons prioryear payment for each onethird share of royalty eliminated As such it could completely eliminate Enrons royalty payments by the end of the fifth year As incentive to buy out Enron UBSs royalty payments otherwise would increase by from years five through up to a maximum of share of pretax profit Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said yesterday that he felt it was a grandslam great deal for creditors since new life is being breathed into a perishable commodity Enrons staff had been kept together largely on the basis of retention bonuses that expire at the end of February The trading operation effectively suspended operations prior to Enrons Chapter filing last month Enron had hoped to bring in a creditworthy partner to take a stake in a new trading joint venture leaving the energy company with a stake But Mr McMahon said no bidder was interested in that deal There also were no bids for the trading operation from rival energy or energytrading companies One possible reason was that resuscitating Enrons vast trading business would require a top credit rating lots of capital to back trading operations and an expert creditrisk department to keep track of what traders are doing and to constantly revalue the trading book Since the Enron debacle other energytrading firms have taken pains to show they are deemphasizing commoditylike trading of electricity which Enron pioneered and are instead concentrating on selling their own output of energy products and entering into contracts to protect themselves against price volatility Mr McMahon said he feels that by virtue of a AAplus bank purchasing this business it changes the landscape of the energymerchant business forever by putting more clout in the hands of institutions with top credit ratings UBS apparently hasnt committed to provide any set level of capital There is no determination yet for how royalty payments would be divided among Enrons thousands of creditors The largest question though is whether the trading business can truly be revived Although Enrons global wholesale division which included as its biggest component the North American energytrading operations generated about billion in pretax profit during the first nine months of it has been dormant now for more than a month Martin Bienenstock Enrons lead bankruptcy lawyer characterized the deal as the sale of something that was dead that we are trying to bring back to life Competitors say they think a certain amount of Enrons trades were conducted at very thin margins in order to build volume and that such trading practice likely will disappear Youll see the churn going away says Michael McNally chief financial officer of TXU Corp now the biggest electricity trader in Texas He thinks EnronOnline has significant value but theres only a limited number of people who would know how to use it Scaled to transact trades on hundreds of types of contracts the platform is oversized for most uses UBS Warburg which bought PaineWebber in has looked to expand its US market share and the Enron deal would provide entry into energy trading John Costas chief executive of UBS Warburg said Friday the Enron unit would be a valuable extension of our worldwide trading activities The winner of the auction held under the bankruptcy courts supervision was announced shortly after noon Friday in a packed Manhattan courtroom less than an hour after the two bidders had submitted final offers Enrons advisers and its creditors committee which endorsed the UBS deal had negotiated nonstop for more than hours In addition to Citigroup which Mr McMahon said competed neck and neck with UBS BP PLC the British oil company had submitted a million bid for the computer settlement support system of the Enron unit The proposed UBS transaction is subject to approval by Judge Arthur J Gonzalez of the US Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York who officially closed the auction to new bidders Friday A hearing is set for Thursday at which creditors will have an opportunity to voice objections Separately Friday Judge Gonzalez declined to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston denying motions from several creditors who had argued that Enrons headquarters city was a more suitable venue Anita Greil contributed to this article Journal
