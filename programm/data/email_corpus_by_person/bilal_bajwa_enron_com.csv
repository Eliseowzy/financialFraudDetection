<6314536.1075840576754.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bilal.bajwa@enron.com,2001-09-19 11:36:16,REPST I grew up in Lahore which is about miles from Islamabadthe capital My parents are still settled there Its not as advanced at most of the big cities here but it is pretty Parts of Pakistan in the north are actually a hikers paradise Very green very pretty and not very commercial not like the more dry rugged areas in Afghanistan The country on the whole has a very low literacy rate and that is the root cause for a lot of problems that we are currently seeing There are a lot of Europeansmainly English who are settled in Pakistan for years and infect my motheraunt and most of my family have studied in Catholic schools That side of the story often goes untold Eventhough a lot of people oppose the US led attacks you would be surprised at how many people in Pakistan support the attacks on Afghanistan Those who oppose ar ejust more militant and vocal but not the majority by any means Most are just afraid of their security Also they feel that they are already so poor that they cannot afford to go to war But i think if this goes well it would be really good for the country As for American foreign policy I think its has a lot of short term focus and can improve but then again it is always easy to criticize somebody on the top The good things achieved by Americans is often conviniently forgotten Bilal Original Message From Griffith John Sent Wednesday September PM To Bajwa Bilal Subject RE thank you so it looks like if Pakistan supports the US the US better be ready to help out in the future It is like the US is supporting whoever they think will help them best at that time Not that I am supporting the US but that is probably what most countries do anyway right anyway i hope your family is okay and that everything will work out for the best none of us want people like the terrorist running around the world free whether they be middle eastern american israeli whatever by the way what city does your parents live in did you grow up there is it a nice city sorry for the questions I am just interested in other cultures Original Message From Bajwa Bilal Sent Wednesday September AM To Griffith John Subject RE John Thanks for asking i am glad you try to get more information before forming opinions I have also posted an article of the fundy website due to requests by Hunter which you might find informative The antiwest opinion is definitely a minority opinion However as we have seen in the past even in US minorities like KKK terrorists mass murderers religious fanatics pose the biggest threat and try to get the most publicity and unfortunately they are succeeding for right now I think the educated population felt betrayed by the west in fighting fundamentalism uptil now but they support this move But you have to understand that most of the big cities in Pakistan are within the range of the Taliban Scud missiles Thats why support is a very relative term here The general does not have any political mandate he came into power through a military coup However the previously democratically elected governments were notorious for corruptionincluding the government of Benazir Bhutto the first women head of state of Pakistan who was educated in Harvard and Oxford So people by default support any other alternative and military is probably the ony institution that is relatively untouched by corruption Most of the cabinet and ministers right now are liberals and among them are some that gave up extremely lucrative jobs in US in order to try to help put the country back on track economically Let me send you an article from the TIME mag that kind of explains why the President of Pakistan is in a fix timenationarticlehtml Also below is part of an article from a Pakistani newspaper explaining how the President met with all the political and religious parties and explained to them why he supports the US In the article the PPP and PML are the two major parties in Pakistan Just like the Democrats and Republicans here and the JamatiiIslami and the other parties are the religous parties He apprised the political leaders that the US administration had demanded concrete actions as a proof of friendship The measures that Washington wanted Islamabad to take included allowing American troops to use Naval facilities and airspace and sharing of all intelligence reports about Osama bin Ladens movement inside Afghanistan Otherwise the president told the politicians Washington had warned that it would treat Pakistan as a country harbouring terrorists In that case the president said no strategic installations would have remained safe I could not take that risk the source quoted President Musharraf as having said The president said that he could risk his life but he could not put the whole country at risk The US authorities had also conveyed to President Musharraf that they had the technological capability to smoke out the Taliban or Osama out of their holes This was interpreted by the politicians as a threat to use chemical or biological weapons in Afghanistan Having received these explanations main stream political parties including the PPP and the PML likeminded backed the presidents decision and said the country should rally round the government the source said However JamaatiIslami and Jamiat UlemaiIslam both Maulana Sami and Maulana Fazl groups opposed the decision and asked the government to review its policy They insisted that the government should demand for a credible evidence of Osamas involvement in the Sept attacks on the US soil Hope this helps you understand the cuurent situation without confusing you too much Bilal Original Message From Griffith John Sent Wednesday

population think Does the general have any backing from the people themselves What is your opinion I understand that these things are very personal to you Please let me know if I am prying I just
