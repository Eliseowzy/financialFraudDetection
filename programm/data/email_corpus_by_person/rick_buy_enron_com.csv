Mark E CT cc Lance Schuler CT Subject Cypress Exploration ProgramOperatorCash Call Issue Mark I spoke briefly to Steve Pruett this past week regarding the Cypress JOA cash call issue that you had inquired about As I mentioned in my voicemail to you I was not aware of the farmout arrangement or JOA with Kelley and had not been asked to review the farmout agreement or the JOA I obtained copies of the documents and asked Steve to fill me in on how the situation developed Steve was out of the office much of last week he followed up Friday with the attached email message As Steve mentions in his email there were extenuating circumstances and timing issues but certainly it was a mistake for a rig to be moved and a well spudded without agreements in place and for documents to be signed without appropriate review and approval I understand that John Thompson and Steve made the decision to move the rig and spud the well when they had a term sheet and draft agreement that they anticipated being able to sign in short order Allen Wilhite and I frequently work together to get documentation finalized and in form for Steves execution From Steves reaction when I told him I had not reviewed or initialled the farmout which had been initialled by Allen I believe he had assumed that had been the case in this situation as well although he did not try to place responsibility on Allen Steve is one of the best and the brightest Ive worked with at Enron He is extremely busy working very hard to manage the portfolio of existing E P assets as well as working on new deals I have worked with Steve enough to know that he would never have intentionally failed to follow our procedures I think this incident was a mistake that will not be repeated I will remind the ECR group at Mondays staff meeting that review by the legal department is required before any agreements are signed Where do we go from here Would you like for me to arrange a meeting with Steve Please let me know if there is anything further you would like for me to do Steve raises the issue of staffing in his email In light of the level of activity for new ECR deals time that is required in assisting Global Finance with Condor and a funding vehicle for the VPPs and the increased legal time required as Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar are no longer managed by third parties being able to provide quality and timely legal advice is increasingly difficult and staffing is an issue that I hope can be addressed soon Teresa Teresa G Bushman Enron North America Corp Smith Street EB A Houston TX fax Forwarded by Teresa G BushmanHOUECT on PM Steve NRON PM To cc Subject Kelly Farmout Agreement Cypress Venture Teresa Thank you for approaching me directly about the issue of my failure to obtain legal review of the subject farmout agreement in Enron Energy Capital Resources ECR Cypress Venture The circumstances of the event follow to the best of my knowledge without confirming with Allen Wilhite who is presently inaccessible Rozel Energy led by Bill Rogers identified a high potential relatively low risk prospect in late August on acreage held by Kelley Oil Gas sub of Contour Energy He commissioned a lease check and found that Kelley controlled of the acreage but it was set to expire on Sept Rozel after reviewing the prospect with ECR technical personnel and receiving approval to do so sought to acquire top leases over the prospect only to find that others had already topleased a significant portion of the prospect Had the Kelley lease expired these parties would have controlled and drilled the prospect Rozel with the help of Allen Wilhite approached Kelley for a farmout Kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that Kelley would be willing to farmout approximately of its interest or farmout all of its interest retaining an ORRI convertible to a WI APO or higher ORRI at its option Kelley elected to participate for of its interest in the well before the farmout agreement was drafted Kelley agreed to general terms in a brief letter agreement Kelley sought to operate the well which ECR rejected due to Kelleys poor track record in drilling deep S Louisiana wells Rozel Energy is the operator in absence of Enron having an operating vehicle Rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in S Louisiana Stokes and Speiler who are being managed daily by Arvel Martin and Bob Devine who each have over years experience in mangement of drilling operations Inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute the negotiation of the JOA and the farmout agreement was strained and Kelley was nonresponsive to Allens efforts to finalize the agreement Allen Craig Fox Arvel Martin and I met with Kelleys Land Manager and VP of Operations and established a dialogue and rapport we thought The initial draft of the farmout agreement was put together on Sept th by Kelley and Allen Allen did not share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal provisions particularly who would operate ECR members were in dispute over the importance of operations With Kelleys consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach terms with Kelley we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior to the Sept th lease expiration Allen and I continued to be frustrated with not reaching final contract terms with Kelley after the well was spudded I pressed Allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an agreement signed by Kelley on October effective Sept Following my signature and upon his departure to Kelleys offices to deliver the document I asked him if you had reviewed JOA and he said no I asked him if it was required or customary for Legal to review JOAs and he said it was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions I did not ask specifically about farmout agreements The Kelley farmout was the first farmout in a directlyowned asset that I had encountered I failed to recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that I had seen executed by our GPs in our Juniper Bonne Terre historically and Texland ventures and a farmout with Enrons name on the line It is my job as a Vice President to know what requires Legal review I have been made aware that farmout agreements and JOAs in directly owned assets as opposed to LPs with a GP such as Juniper require Legal review and signoff The compliance meeting last week underscored that point We had outside counsel Lisa Jaubert under your direction review the TriC and Manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval I respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that I will be diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or issue The demands that our large oil gas exploration portfolio places on you is another issue that we should discuss The Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will continue Dissolution of Bonne Terre and distribution of the assets to ENA to be held in BT Exploration LLC will increase the legal and commercial activity level We have another prospect in Cypress that is being promoted and will be spudded in the next days so expect to see a farmout agreement on the S Riceville prospect late next week I would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and Mark Haedicke in person if you desire I regret my failure to obtain your review and approval of the Kelley farmout agreement and commit to preventing a repeat of the mistake I am concerned about the pace of agreements that we face in the immediate future on our directowned ventures I look forward to working with you on ways to better manage our business process in CypressAcadian Bonne Terre Vastar ventures

Mark E CT cc Lance Schuler CT Subject Cypress Exploration ProgramOperatorCash Call Issue Mark I spoke briefly to Steve Pruett this past week regarding the Cypress JOA cash call issue that you had inquired about As I mentioned in my voicemail to you I was not aware of the farmout arrangement or JOA with Kelley and had not been asked to review the farmout agreement or the JOA I obtained copies of the documents and asked Steve to fill me in on how the situation developed Steve was out of the office much of last week he followed up Friday with the attached email message As Steve mentions in his email there were extenuating circumstances and timing issues but certainly it was a mistake for a rig to be moved and a well spudded without agreements in place and for documents to be signed without appropriate review and approval I understand that John Thompson and Steve made the decision to move the rig and spud the well when they had a term sheet and draft agreement that they anticipated being able to sign in short order Allen Wilhite and I frequently work together to get documentation finalized and in form for Steves execution From Steves reaction when I told him I had not reviewed or initialled the farmout which had been initialled by Allen I believe he had assumed that had been the case in this situation as well although he did not try to place responsibility on Allen Steve is one of the best and the brightest Ive worked with at Enron He is extremely busy working very hard to manage the portfolio of existing E P assets as well as working on new deals I have worked with Steve enough to know that he would never have intentionally failed to follow our procedures I think this incident was a mistake that will not be repeated I will remind the ECR group at Mondays staff meeting that review by the legal department is required before any agreements are signed Where do we go from here Would you like for me to arrange a meeting with Steve Please let me know if there is anything further you would like for me to do Steve raises the issue of staffing in his email In light of the level of activity for new ECR deals time that is required in assisting Global Finance with Condor and a funding vehicle for the VPPs and the increased legal time required as Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar are no longer managed by third parties being able to provide quality and timely legal advice is increasingly difficult and staffing is an issue that I hope can be addressed soon Teresa Teresa G Bushman Enron North America Corp Smith Street EB A Houston TX fax Forwarded by Teresa G BushmanHOUECT on PM Steve NRON PM To cc Subject Kelly Farmout Agreement Cypress Venture Teresa Thank you for approaching me directly about the issue of my failure to obtain legal review of the subject farmout agreement in Enron Energy Capital Resources ECR Cypress Venture The circumstances of the event follow to the best of my knowledge without confirming with Allen Wilhite who is presently inaccessible Rozel Energy led by Bill Rogers identified a high potential relatively low risk prospect in late August on acreage held by Kelley Oil Gas sub of Contour Energy He commissioned a lease check and found that Kelley controlled of the acreage but it was set to expire on Sept Rozel after reviewing the prospect with ECR technical personnel and receiving approval to do so sought to acquire top leases over the prospect only to find that others had already topleased a significant portion of the prospect Had the Kelley lease expired these parties would have controlled and drilled the prospect Rozel with the help of Allen Wilhite approached Kelley for a farmout Kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that Kelley would be willing to farmout approximately of its interest or farmout all of its interest retaining an ORRI convertible to a WI APO or higher ORRI at its option Kelley elected to participate for of its interest in the well before the farmout agreement was drafted Kelley agreed to general terms in a brief letter agreement Kelley sought to operate the well which ECR rejected due to Kelleys poor track record in drilling deep S Louisiana wells Rozel Energy is the operator in absence of Enron having an operating vehicle Rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in S Louisiana Stokes and Speiler who are being managed daily by Arvel Martin and Bob Devine who each have over years experience in mangement of drilling operations Inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute the negotiation of the JOA and the farmout agreement was strained and Kelley was nonresponsive to Allens efforts to finalize the agreement Allen Craig Fox Arvel Martin and I met with Kelleys Land Manager and VP of Operations and established a dialogue and rapport we thought The initial draft of the farmout agreement was put together on Sept th by Kelley and Allen Allen did not share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal provisions particularly who would operate ECR members were in dispute over the importance of operations With Kelleys consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach terms with Kelley we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior to the Sept th lease expiration Allen and I continued to be frustrated with not reaching final contract terms with Kelley after the well was spudded I pressed Allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an agreement signed by Kelley on October effective Sept Following my signature and upon his departure to Kelleys offices to deliver the document I asked him if you had reviewed JOA and he said no I asked him if it was required or customary for Legal to review JOAs and he said it was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions I did not ask specifically about farmout agreements The Kelley farmout was the first farmout in a directlyowned asset that I had encountered I failed to recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that I had seen executed by our GPs in our Juniper Bonne Terre historically and Texland ventures and a farmout with Enrons name on the line It is my job as a Vice President to know what requires Legal review I have been made aware that farmout agreements and JOAs in directly owned assets as opposed to LPs with a GP such as Juniper require Legal review and signoff The compliance meeting last week underscored that point We had outside counsel Lisa Jaubert under your direction review the TriC and Manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval I respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that I will be diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or issue The demands that our large oil gas exploration portfolio places on you is another issue that we should discuss The Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will continue Dissolution of Bonne Terre and distribution of the assets to ENA to be held in BT Exploration LLC will increase the legal and commercial activity level We have another prospect in Cypress that is being promoted and will be spudded in the next days so expect to see a farmout agreement on the S Riceville prospect late next week I would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and Mark Haedicke in person if you desire I regret my failure to obtain your review and approval of the Kelley farmout agreement and commit to preventing a repeat of the mistake I am concerned about the pace of agreements that we face in the immediate future on our directowned ventures I look forward to working with you on ways to better manage our business process in CypressAcadian Bonne Terre Vastar ventures

This is the response I sent to Mark a couple of weeks ago after I first heard of this matter I have since learned that they expect the cost overrun to be between or net to our interest Kelley has promised orally to pay their joint interest billings promptly and the billings are being generated every two weeks Two have gone out one of which for has already been paid by Kelley Please let me know if there is anything further youd like for me to do Teresa Teresa G Bushman Enron North America Corp Smith Street EB A Houston TX fax Forwarded by Teresa G BushmanHOUECT on PM Teresa G Bushman PM To Mark E CT cc Lance Schuler CT Subject Cypress Exploration ProgramOperatorCash Call Issue Mark I spoke briefly to Steve Pruett this past week regarding the Cypress JOA cash call issue that you had inquired about As I mentioned in my voicemail to you I was not aware of the farmout arrangement or JOA with Kelley and had not been asked to review the farmout agreement or the JOA I obtained copies of the documents and asked Steve to fill me in on how the situation developed Steve was out of the office much of last week he followed up Friday with the attached email message As Steve mentions in his email there were extenuating circumstances and timing issues but certainly it was a mistake for a rig to be moved and a well spudded without agreements in place and for documents to be signed without appropriate review and approval I understand that John Thompson and Steve made the decision to move the rig and spud the well when they had a term sheet and draft agreement that they anticipated being able to sign in short order Allen Wilhite and I frequently work together to get documentation finalized and in form for Steves execution From Steves reaction when I told him I had not reviewed or initialled the farmout which had been initialled by Allen I believe he had assumed that had been the case in this situation as well although he did not try to place responsibility on Allen Steve is one of the best and the brightest Ive worked with at Enron He is extremely busy working very hard to manage the portfolio of existing E P assets as well as working on new deals I have worked with Steve enough to know that he would never have intentionally failed to follow our procedures I think this incident was a mistake that will not be repeated I will remind the ECR group at Mondays staff meeting that review by the legal department is required before any agreements are signed Where do we go from here Would you like for me to arrange a meeting with Steve Please let me know if there is anything further you would like for me to do Steve raises the issue of staffing in his email In light of the level of activity for new ECR deals time that is required in assisting Global Finance with Condor and a funding vehicle for the VPPs and the increased legal time required as Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar are no longer managed by third parties being able to provide quality and timely legal advice is increasingly difficult and staffing is an issue that I hope can be addressed soon Teresa Teresa G Bushman Enron North America Corp Smith Street EB A Houston TX fax Forwarded by Teresa G BushmanHOUECT on PM Steve NRON PM To cc Subject Kelly Farmout Agreement Cypress Venture Teresa Thank you for approaching me directly about the issue of my failure to obtain legal review of the subject farmout agreement in Enron Energy Capital Resources ECR Cypress Venture The circumstances of the event follow to the best of my knowledge without confirming with Allen Wilhite who is presently inaccessible Rozel Energy led by Bill Rogers identified a high potential relatively low risk prospect in late August on acreage held by Kelley Oil Gas sub of Contour Energy He commissioned a lease check and found that Kelley controlled of the acreage but it was set to expire on Sept Rozel after reviewing the prospect with ECR technical personnel and receiving approval to do so sought to acquire top leases over the prospect only to find that others had already topleased a significant portion of the prospect Had the Kelley lease expired these parties would have controlled and drilled the prospect Rozel with the help of Allen Wilhite approached Kelley for a farmout Kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that Kelley would be willing to farmout approximately of its interest or farmout all of its interest retaining an ORRI convertible to a WI APO or higher ORRI at its option Kelley elected to participate for of its interest in the well before the farmout agreement was drafted Kelley agreed to general terms in a brief letter agreement Kelley sought to operate the well which ECR rejected due to Kelleys poor track record in drilling deep S Louisiana wells Rozel Energy is the operator in absence of Enron having an operating vehicle Rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in S Louisiana Stokes and Speiler who are being managed daily by Arvel Martin and Bob Devine who each have over years experience in mangement of drilling operations Inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute the negotiation of the JOA and the farmout agreement was strained and Kelley was nonresponsive to Allens efforts to finalize the agreement Allen Craig Fox Arvel Martin and I met with Kelleys Land Manager and VP of Operations and established a dialogue and rapport we thought The initial draft of the farmout agreement was put together on Sept th by Kelley and Allen Allen did not share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal provisions particularly who would operate ECR members were in dispute over the importance of operations With Kelleys consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach terms with Kelley we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior to the Sept th lease expiration Allen and I continued to be frustrated with not reaching final contract terms with Kelley after the well was spudded I pressed Allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an agreement signed by Kelley on October effective Sept Following my signature and upon his departure to Kelleys offices to deliver the document I asked him if you had reviewed JOA and he said no I asked him if it was required or customary for Legal to review JOAs and he said it was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions I did not ask specifically about farmout agreements The Kelley farmout was the first farmout in a directlyowned asset that I had encountered I failed to recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that I had seen executed by our GPs in our Juniper Bonne Terre historically and Texland ventures and a farmout with Enrons name on the line It is my job as a Vice President to know what requires Legal review I have been made aware that farmout agreements and JOAs in directly owned assets as opposed to LPs with a GP such as Juniper require Legal review and signoff The compliance meeting last week underscored that point We had outside counsel Lisa Jaubert under your direction review the TriC and Manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval I respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that I will be diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or issue The demands that our large oil gas exploration portfolio places on you is another issue that we should discuss The Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will continue Dissolution of Bonne Terre and distribution of the assets to ENA to be held in BT Exploration LLC will increase the legal and commercial activity level We have another prospect in Cypress that is being promoted and will be spudded in the next days so expect to see a farmout agreement on the S Riceville prospect late next week I would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and Mark Haedicke in person if you desire I regret my failure to obtain your review and approval of the Kelley farmout agreement and commit to preventing a repeat of the mistake I am concerned about the pace of agreements that we face in the immediate future on our directowned ventures I look forward to working with you on ways to better manage our business process in CypressAcadian Bonne Terre Vastar ventures

Traffic World Page Copyright Gale Group Inc All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Journal of Commerce Inc Truckers still waiting for signs of pentup freight demand earnings shortfalls layoffs loom If you are waiting for trucking to kickstart the nations economic recovery pull up a chair and wait awhile Trucking CEOs say they havent seen this slow a first quarter in a decade Perhaps the weakest first quarter for freight demand since Swift became a public company in Phoenixbased Swift Transportation Chairman and CEO Jerry Moyes said The firstquarter trucking mantra historically has been this everybody loses money in January hopes for a breakeven February and earns whatever profit there is in the quarter in March That formula may not hold this year Gregory L Quesnel president and CEO of ConWay Transportation Services and Emery Worldwide parent CNF Inc said the current slowdown was first detected late in the third quarter last year and has become more pronounced in each successive quarter March he said has been as disappointing as the first two months this year Layoffs already are occurring at the major LTL carriers Yellow Freight System has idled as many as Teamsters and hundreds of whitecollar backoffice workers Most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls that will cause them to miss analysts firstquarter estimates But there are deeper fears too Marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy Small familyowned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years ago Swifts volume dropoff began with shipments originating on the West Coast in January and February and it is continuing in March Moyes said Coupled with reduced demand from the Southwest Moyes said Swift will not meet analysts firstquarter earnings expectations Swift is not alone We hauled less freight in February than February a year ago said Bob Hammel executive vice president of Pittsburghbased Pitt Ohio Express a leading privately held Eastern regional LTL carrier The slowdown in manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous Nobody anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off Even ConWay the most profitable LTL operation in the past five years said it would have a decline in firstquarter operating income compared with the yearago period ConWays tonnage declines were estimated in the midsingledigit percentage range Roadway Express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running to percent below those a year ago which will result in an approximately onehalf of percent percent decline in its operating ratio see sidebar Pat Hanley Overnite Transportations senior vice president and chief financial officer said freight figures were flat in February year over year but rose slightly in March Overnite is the exception to the LTL industry with as many as new terminals scheduled to be opened this year January was pretty good to us but February was flat Its coming back in March Were probably up in low single digits to percent Were picking back up The economy has hurt us If you had asked us at the start of the year wed have said wed be up doubledigits Hanley said The national economic picture is a big concern Hanley said Were not seeing pressure on prices at least not so far Were seeing customers ship pallets a day instead of The shipment size is coming down Certainly were concerned Well do OK but not as great as wed like Forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever stars align in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspans world The genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking which is always a firstin firstout industry in any economic slowdown To hear trucking industry leaders tell it get comfortable with beans and franks for dinner Its going to be awhile before its filet mignon time again Shippers see whats happening as well but say its still too early in the year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks All the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business levels definitely slower than early last year said Bill Huie assistant vice president of corporate transportation for NCH Corp Irving Texas With a couple of exceptions carriers we talk with have no plans for expansion in the next few months We are getting feelers about some possible lane adjustments to boost revenue But generally it appears a little early in the economic downturn for much price movement The national LTL carriers are seeing the same things Our business is down pretty substantially for the first quarter said Roger Dick spokesman for Yellow Corp parent of Yellow Freight System and two large regional LTL carriers Jevic Transportation Delanco NJ and Saia Motor Freight Duluth Ga USFreightways Corp citing what it called the nations serious economic slowdown said it expects firstquarter earnings to fall very substantially below current Wall Street consensus Extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating environment USF Chairman President and CEO Samuel K Skinner added Traditionally the first quarter builds momentum slowly with March being the strongest month of the period Skinner said in a statement This year the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of accelerated in January and February softening even the normal modest expectations for those two months Its not just the LTL industry thats hurting The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter truckload freight index continues to show the worst demandsupply relationship since analyst James J Valentine began tracking the data in April Two events can cause weakness in the index according to Valentine They are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak freight demand So far in we have seen the confluence of both factors but the falloff in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply Valentine wrote in his most recent Trucking Snapshot for early March Yeartodate measurement for truckload demand is down percent year over year according to Valentines index while supply is up only percent That would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was masked by the strong economy Valentine says In a more ominous note Valentine believes overcapacity will continue to plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years Only a reaccelerating national economy can bring the demandsupply back in balance for the truckload sector in the near term Valentine predicts The overproduction of new Class trucks from early through early last year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at manufacturers wholesalers and other retailers Used trucks have lost on average more than percent of their value over the past months Anecdotally one used truck dealer Music City Truck Equipment in LaVergne Tenn is holding a twoforone sale on three to fiveyearold Class Freightliners You can buy two for around less than a brand new Chevy Suburban SUV What that means is a trucker who bought a Class truck for and depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the books this year at But assuming it has lost percent of that value it may only be worth in actuality For a carrier with a truck fleet that equates to a loss of more than million on assets The glut may last for a while according to Valentines analysis Assuming a threeyear tradein cycle most of the Class tractors in the truckload sector are just now rolling over to the usedtruck market That means that overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year That will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business as did nearly carriers last year that either closed or declared bankruptcy We can see from indexes surveys and other information available to us that it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in March and freight demands will continue to be soft throughout the month Based on all of these factors we expect USFreightways profits for the first quarter to be very substantially less than published analysts forecasts Skinner said In addition severe weather conditions including an earthquake in Seattle rainstorms in California and blizzards in the Northeast have added cost and decreased efficiencies Skinner added Expectations at each of USFs operating companies have been affected some more than others The LTL logistics reverse logistics and freightforwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a similar period last year Skinner said Further job cuts at USF Worldwide its freight forwarder would be in the offing as cost controls at the unit would be accelerated in the wake of the softening economy Skinner said Late last year Skinner said the rebuilding process at USF Worldwide would be a twoyear process But the worsening economy has made that rebuilding job harder he said We are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is in fact further impeding progress in this area Skinner said During the fourth quarter of and continuing into the first quarter of the company has taken steps to increase cost efficiencies Among these actions are a substantial cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force These costcontrol efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions In

knowledgeable about the model so some of these comments may be mute points I plan to do that went I get back Since the credit risk is developed for a time period it makes sense to regularly update the commodity data and credit rating if its chaged and rerun the model for the time remaining I would expect this is done already The default probabilities seem not to change That is if the input credit rating is E then the E default probability curve is used for the contract period For annual accounting that seems OK but in MTM it seems to me that the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities That is the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period with some constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world Are all defaults created equal to us Look at OC It seems to me that the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are OK for that range of companies However we are dealing with specific types of firms where default may not mean we do not get paid Sure we still have some credit risk but its not like Montgomery Wards where the lights are being turned off for good Energy is so fundamental for a companys success and default actions can be used as a way to

least enough proactive vision to contract EES then they are more likely to improve that one that doesnt This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesnt consider This would be a useful MBA

charged the highest rates Tx Rick Original Message From Schneider Chip Sent Monday April PM To Calger Christopher Steffes James Ngo Tracy Cc Buy Rick Gorte David Subject Article on PowerEnron from the Seattle Times From the Seattle Times seattletimescom Energy costs soak City Light by Jim Brunner mailto Seattle Times staff reporter Seattle City Light spent a record million buying power on the market in March more than any month in its year history City Light officials say the cost of buying power for local residents and businesses eclipsed the previous records million set in February and nearly million in January To put that in perspective In before the current power crisis the utilitys total power bill for the entire year was million Were spending that every month now The dollars that are involved are staggering said Paula Green deputy superintendent of City Light Its a cash hemorrhage brought on by Washingtons drought which means less water in the reservoirs at cityowned dams That increases Seattles need to purchase electricity on a market where prices have zoomed to unprecedented levels Adding to the frustration for Seattle city officials is the fact that most of that money is flowing to outofstate utilities and power brokers who are profiting enormously from the energy crunch Last month alone the bill from Enron a Houstonbased corporation was million putting it well ahead of the No seller Californias Sempra Energy which sold million worth of electricity to City Light City Light still gets most of the megawatts necessary to serve its load from cityowned dams and from its contract with the Bonneville Power Administration BPA The utility buys only about percent of its power on the market But that thin slice now accounts for more than percent of its power costs Part of the explanation for Marchs record powerbuying binge was City Lights recent decision to store up extra water behind Ross Dam on the Skagit River instead of spilling it through the dams power turbines In a normal water year City Light officials would be spilling water for energy and expecting it would be replaced with spring runoff Now theyre saving the water so it can be spilled later to help salmon runs and to generate power for Seattle this summer when energy prices are expected to surge even higher to more than per megawatt hour Were insulating ourselves By putting out one eye now were avoiding cutting off our head later said Bob Royer City Light spokesman Seattle ratepayers are feeling the pain with a percent City Light rate increase so far this year More rate increases are likely on the way Higher rates have also led to plant closures and layoffs in Bellingham and Spokane Meanwhile Enrons revenues more than doubled last year to billion Its stock prices surged to end the year at a share up from the year before The stock was trading at a share last week It doesnt just feel unfair but immoral that these major companies like Enron are making billions of dollars at the expense of everyday people and businesses said City Councilwoman Heidi Wills who chairs the Councils Energy and Environmental Policy Committee Theres this enormous transfer of wealth from our ratepayers to the shareholders of these companies Wills said Northwest leaders have called for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose price caps But opponents say price caps would do nothing to encourage the construction of new power plants or energy conservation Karen Denne an Enron spokeswoman said its unfair to fault the company for selling power at prices dictated by the free market Enron is providing electricity to a market that needs it Denne said Its unfortunate when regulators are pointing fingers looking to fix blame when this is a problem of supply and demand The company hails from President George W Bushs home state of Texas and is one of the top soft money donors to political campaigns Enron and its executives gave to the Democrats and million to Republicans last year according to Common Cause Its chairman Kenneth Lay has consistently been one of the top donors to Bushs presidential and gubernatorial campaigns Enron doesnt own a lot of dams or power plants Instead the company makes money as a middleman buying power from utilities and then reselling it for a profit The company formed in from the merger of two pipeline companies has become the largest trader of wholesale electricity in North America Part of its success in the energy market stems from its groundbreaking use of the Internet to make buying electricity as easy as ordering a book online You just point click and spend Its easier than Amazon said Steve Lewis a power marketer with City Light demonstrating the companys Web site It lists available power products and the asking price for both buyers and sellers Lewis and other power marketers monitor City Lights projected power needs and then use the phone or Internet to schedule electricity for the next hour next day or months ahead They try to find the best price available but its clearly a sellers market Utilities routinely buy power that used to cost per megawatt hour for more than At times last month City Light was buying power for a megawatt hour And its not because the cost of generation has gone up This is pure profit said Green deputy superintendent of City Light There is evidence that the Northwest is in some ways being hit even harder than California whose experiment with deregulation is blamed for roiling the power markets A recent analysis found that Pacific Northwest utilities are paying the highest prices in the nation for the nextday delivery of wholesale power However regional utilities also sell power for extraordinarily high prices In fact some of the highest average prices paid by City Light last month were to neighbors Puget Sound Energy Western Washingtons largest electric utility charged City Light the highest average price of any seller last month at per megawatt hour according to City Lights preliminary billing estimates Spokanes Avista Energy charged That compares with Enrons average price of per megawatt hour and an overall average of The BPA by comparison charges City Light per megawatt hour City Light typically relies on local utilities more when it needs power delivered immediately And prices for shortterm deals can be higher depending on the time of day The city has only a longterm contract with the BPA Despite the recordsetting month city officials hope theyll be in better shape before the year is out Mayor Paul Schell has taken to calling Oct Seattles energy independence day because thats when the city will begin receiving more hydroelectric power under a new contract with the BPA The historically cheap BPA power combined with a contract with a gasfired power plant in Klamath Falls Ore should reduce the citys reliance on the open market city officials say But the BPA too has been stricken by higher market power costs and may have to increase its rates to City Light by percent The City Council has already agreed to pass those higher costs on to Seattle ratepayers although its unclear how much that would raise the bill of the average person Even at a higher rate City Light officials regard the BPA power as a good longterm strategy for getting power costs under control If they succeed the rate increases approved this year could eventually be rescinded Until then local ratepayers will have to keep writing bigger checks to City Light with the knowledge that some of their money will find its way to Texas Jim Brunner can

with New Power to serve residential load on its behalf or can pay the per MWH penalty There is an annual compliance reporting requirement and EES can demonstrate compliance if it has an agreement with New Power EES Contract For price to beat customers the utilities have by Commission rule the obl igation to allow customers to come and go without restraint for the year period conmmencing The Commission concern may be that Enron will ab use this provision by gaming the system The Enron contracts as currently w ritten are within the rules as approved by the Commission Until the utilit ies move to amend the relevant rules the Commission can only exercise its displeasure by appropriate oversight and enforcement to determine what cond uct amounts to abuse and gaming I think it will ultimately be a question o f degree and pattern of switching The onus will be on the affiliated REPs to prove abuse and gaming Fundamentally it is in the best interest of the market to allow customers to come and go Customer mobility is the best cu stomer protection in a competitive market Besides a restraint on customer mobility could have a chilling effect on competition as it will increase c

Mark E CT cc Lance Schuler CT Subject Cypress Exploration ProgramOperatorCash Call Issue Mark I spoke briefly to Steve Pruett this past week regarding the Cypress JOA cash call issue that you had inquired about As I mentioned in my voicemail to you I was not aware of the farmout arrangement or JOA with Kelley and had not been asked to review the farmout agreement or the JOA I obtained copies of the documents and asked Steve to fill me in on how the situation developed Steve was out of the office much of last week he followed up Friday with the attached email message As Steve mentions in his email there were extenuating circumstances and timing issues but certainly it was a mistake for a rig to be moved and a well spudded without agreements in place and for documents to be signed without appropriate review and approval I understand that John Thompson and Steve made the decision to move the rig and spud the well when they had a term sheet and draft agreement that they anticipated being able to sign in short order Allen Wilhite and I frequently work together to get documentation finalized and in form for Steves execution From Steves reaction when I told him I had not reviewed or initialled the farmout which had been initialled by Allen I believe he had assumed that had been the case in this situation as well although he did not try to place responsibility on Allen Steve is one of the best and the brightest Ive worked with at Enron He is extremely busy working very hard to manage the portfolio of existing E P assets as well as working on new deals I have worked with Steve enough to know that he would never have intentionally failed to follow our procedures I think this incident was a mistake that will not be repeated I will remind the ECR group at Mondays staff meeting that review by the legal department is required before any agreements are signed Where do we go from here Would you like for me to arrange a meeting with Steve Please let me know if there is anything further you would like for me to do Steve raises the issue of staffing in his email In light of the level of activity for new ECR deals time that is required in assisting Global Finance with Condor and a funding vehicle for the VPPs and the increased legal time required as Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar are no longer managed by third parties being able to provide quality and timely legal advice is increasingly difficult and staffing is an issue that I hope can be addressed soon Teresa Teresa G Bushman Enron North America Corp Smith Street EB A Houston TX fax Forwarded by Teresa G BushmanHOUECT on PM Steve NRON PM To cc Subject Kelly Farmout Agreement Cypress Venture Teresa Thank you for approaching me directly about the issue of my failure to obtain legal review of the subject farmout agreement in Enron Energy Capital Resources ECR Cypress Venture The circumstances of the event follow to the best of my knowledge without confirming with Allen Wilhite who is presently inaccessible Rozel Energy led by Bill Rogers identified a high potential relatively low risk prospect in late August on acreage held by Kelley Oil Gas sub of Contour Energy He commissioned a lease check and found that Kelley controlled of the acreage but it was set to expire on Sept Rozel after reviewing the prospect with ECR technical personnel and receiving approval to do so sought to acquire top leases over the prospect only to find that others had already topleased a significant portion of the prospect Had the Kelley lease expired these parties would have controlled and drilled the prospect Rozel with the help of Allen Wilhite approached Kelley for a farmout Kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that Kelley would be willing to farmout approximately of its interest or farmout all of its interest retaining an ORRI convertible to a WI APO or higher ORRI at its option Kelley elected to participate for of its interest in the well before the farmout agreement was drafted Kelley agreed to general terms in a brief letter agreement Kelley sought to operate the well which ECR rejected due to Kelleys poor track record in drilling deep S Louisiana wells Rozel Energy is the operator in absence of Enron having an operating vehicle Rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in S Louisiana Stokes and Speiler who are being managed daily by Arvel Martin and Bob Devine who each have over years experience in mangement of drilling operations Inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute the negotiation of the JOA and the farmout agreement was strained and Kelley was nonresponsive to Allens efforts to finalize the agreement Allen Craig Fox Arvel Martin and I met with Kelleys Land Manager and VP of Operations and established a dialogue and rapport we thought The initial draft of the farmout agreement was put together on Sept th by Kelley and Allen Allen did not share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal provisions particularly who would operate ECR members were in dispute over the importance of operations With Kelleys consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach terms with Kelley we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior to the Sept th lease expiration Allen and I continued to be frustrated with not reaching final contract terms with Kelley after the well was spudded I pressed Allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an agreement signed by Kelley on October effective Sept Following my signature and upon his departure to Kelleys offices to deliver the document I asked him if you had reviewed JOA and he said no I asked him if it was required or customary for Legal to review JOAs and he said it was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions I did not ask specifically about farmout agreements The Kelley farmout was the first farmout in a directlyowned asset that I had encountered I failed to recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that I had seen executed by our GPs in our Juniper Bonne Terre historically and Texland ventures and a farmout with Enrons name on the line It is my job as a Vice President to know what requires Legal review I have been made aware that farmout agreements and JOAs in directly owned assets as opposed to LPs with a GP such as Juniper require Legal review and signoff The compliance meeting last week underscored that point We had outside counsel Lisa Jaubert under your direction review the TriC and Manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval I respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that I will be diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or issue The demands that our large oil gas exploration portfolio places on you is another issue that we should discuss The Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will continue Dissolution of Bonne Terre and distribution of the assets to ENA to be held in BT Exploration LLC will increase the legal and commercial activity level We have another prospect in Cypress that is being promoted and will be spudded in the next days so expect to see a farmout agreement on the S Riceville prospect late next week I would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and Mark Haedicke in person if you desire I regret my failure to obtain your review and approval of the Kelley farmout agreement and commit to preventing a repeat of
