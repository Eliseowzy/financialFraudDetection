NORTHWEST AND SHIPPERS LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF MARKET MANIPULA TION Foster Natural Gas Report Page c Copyright Foster Associates Inc FERC issued an order in midmonth September that set for hearing certain co nsolidated proceedings involving several negotiated rate transactions betwe en PGE Gas Transmission Northwest Corporation RP and various ship pers The Commission believes closer scrutiny is called for because these t ransactions appear to provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiple s in excess of maximum approved tariff rates The Commission had issued a suspension order in each proceeding that among other things directed GTN to explain how it had the firm capacity ava ilable to move gas under the transactions in these proceedings and why its entering into the subject negotiated service agreements did not violat e regulations and policy regarding firm transportation service and negotiat ed rate agreements The new expedited hearing procedures are intended to fu rther explore these matters Pending the outcome GTN must revise both its tariff and capacity availability postings to provide for clear identificati on of operational capacity and must post and contract operational capacity on each day of its availability ie on a daytoday basis unless it c an demonstrate such capacity will be available for some longer period of ti me Questions Same as Those Addressed to Transwestern Earlier FERCs concerns in this case are remarkably similar to FTS deals recently arranged by Transwestern Pipeline Co RP that are now the subject of an expedited hearing and investigation Beginning in January Trans western made a series of eight filings implementing FTS negotiated transa ctions with five shippers The filings were accepted and suspended subject to conditions by orders issued March and and April Staff issued data requests to Transwestern Sempra and Richardson In the March orde r FERC also directed Transwestern to show cause why its negotiated rate tr ansactions did not violate the regulations Transwestern answered that the negotiated rate contracts at issue and any others for that matter would n ot have been any less firm or provided a lower quality of service had shipp ers elected instead to pay the recourse rate Underlying these transactio ns Transwestern said is capacity that becomes available only for a short time In July the Commissioners voted to establish the hearing to further explore Transwestern s negotiated transactions that tied rates to gas spot market price differentials between the California border and producing basins in New Mexico and West Texas For service to the border Sempra Energy Trading Corp Richardson Products Co BP Energy Co Astra Power LLC and Reliant Energy Services elected to pay Transwestern negotiated rates as high as MMBtu compared to a maximum FTS recourse rate of centsMMBtu excl uding surcharges and fuel In Transwestern s case the Commission expressed the belief that closer sc rutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many mu ltiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary Did Trans western withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available und er recourse service in order to make the capacity available under negotiate d rate charges at substantially higher rates See REPORT NO pp Background Beginning in March GTN made a series of separate filings pursuant to its rights to implement various negotiated rate transactions under its FTS Rate Schedule with Sempra Dynegy Marketing and Trade Relian t Energy Services Canada Ltd Western Gas Resources Western Ens erco Energy Inc Mirant Americas Energy Marketing LP BP Ener gy Co and CEG Energy Options Inc The filings were accepted and sus pended subject to further proceedings by orders issued on and The transactions established transportation rates ti ed to natural gas spot market price differentials between the Northwest Pip eline interconnection at Stanfield Oregon and the Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co interconnection at Malin on the Or egonCalifornia border According to the data collected by FERC the negotiated rate transactions w ould yield average daily transportation rates many multiples of the maximum FTS rate approximately MMBtu Stanfield to Malin exclusive of surcharges and fuel based on the publicly reported price differentials at the contract receipt and delivery points during the term of the contracts The Commission initiated additional review procedures to further explore qu estions regarding conditions under which operational transportation capacit y may be available on the GTN system GTN has already told the Commission that all negotiated rate shippers knew service was available at the recourse rate but that these shippers chose t o structure the pricing of their contracts in this distinct fashion anyway Further GTN insists the subject firm capacity was posted as available on the companys website and EBB consistent with the Commissions regulations Pursuant to the suspension order FERC received the following information Sempra clarified that MMBtud of its MMBtud total capacity arrangement with GTN was subscribed at the FTS rate But GTN insists Sem pra requested firm backhaul service with the intent of reversing the path Under the negotiated alternative Sempra was persuaded it would not have to pay reservation charges on the full MDQ for a secondary lower priority re verse path service In its response Sempra asserted it wanted to use the c apacity on a secondary basis and thus chose to negotiate a rate structure t hat would best reflect its price risk profile to account for the fact that the capacity may not be available every day Further Sempra stated that th e gas transported was sold into the daily markets at Malin PGEs citygate or the Southern California border market Dynegys rationale for choosing a rate formula rather than the FTS reco urse rate was to gain additional value from the capacity GTN had suggested it could enter into a negotiated agreement based on the daily indextoind ex spread because the StanfieldMalin spread less fuel did not cover the cost of the FTS recourse rate Based on GTNs information Dynegy believe d the price spread was expected to widen and thereby would give it a prici ng opportunity According to Western it initially sought MMBtud of capacity at t he FTS recourse rate but GTNs response did not allow for the total volu me to be shipped at that rate Instead GTN proposed and Western accepted a nother price option MMBtud at the FTS Recourse Rate and M MBtud at the Negotiated Gas Daily Index Rate Neither Reliant nor Enserco filed a response to the Commissions o rder Mirant cited three reasons for choosing the monthly index spread rather t han the recourse rate the index spread was easily hedged at the tim e the market spread was more desirable and reduction of market risk Mi rant believed there were no other practical options to move gas from Stanfi eld to Malin GTN established four negotiated rate agreements with two different shippe rs BP Energy and CEG Energy The BP Energy agreement was accepted as propo sed but FERC accepted and suspended the CEG Energy agreements subject to r efund and further information Similar to the other parties CEG Energy sta ted that it chose a negotiated rate rather than the recourse rate because i t believed the index spread was less expensive than the FTS recourse rate FERC Has Serious Concerns According to the September order GTNs negotiated rate transactions und er investigation present several serious concerns Even with the addition al information in hand the Commission concludes that the filings raise man y issues that need to be investigated further Accordingly an expedited he aring should explore issues including but not limited to whether the tran sportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an accurate and fair mann er consistent with GTNs tariff whether the rates negotiated by GTN were t he product of an exercise of market power ie did GTN withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service just t o make the capacity available under negotiated higher rates why the shipp ers agreed to these rates when lower recourse rates should have been availa ble and lastly whether the practice of improving a shippers standing in the scheduling process by selling firm transportation to undesirable prima ry points so an alternative point can be nominated is discriminatory agains t interruptible transportation shippers since the alternative point is als o available on a somewhat bestefforts basis Since the negotiated rate transactions also raise concerns regarding GTNs posting procedures and its use of firm service contracts for operational ca pacity the Commission also spelled out the need to require GTN to undertak e immediately certain measures to identify more clearly the operational cap acity available on the GTN system and the period for which such capacity is awarded Finally the Commission discovered discrepancies between GTN and the other negotiated parties representations regarding the capacity quantities avail able at the FTS recourse rate Specifically FERCs concerns go to the Se mpra and Western rate agreements whereby the parties initially desired MMBtud at the recourse rate but were provided with a combination of rec ourse service and a negotiated service These actions by GTN may reflect th e exercise of market power and manipulation of the capacity market the Com mission surmises Mark McConnell Transwestern Pipeline Company office cell fax

McConnell Mark Subject FWDHello from Houston Mark Godav to you too And great to hear from you again Yes certainly the world has changed since we last met As it turned out I was in the Enron building in London when it all happened on Sep And to all of us in London that moment has been as defining as it has been to you in the States With one exception We have had terrorism here for a very long time So much so that I have learned to tell the difference between the sounds of an IRA semtex bomb and a Palestinian fertiliser one And life goes on I keep reminding everybody how many people die in the traffic every day and that I shall have to go someday anyway So even though London probably is high on the hit list I have not changed my lifestyle significantly Now it looks like EBS definitively is closing down in Europe Personally if find it a shame since I rather valued the people in the group but probably it was inevitable But I am pleased that you have moved into the Oil and Gas part of Enron Whatever the current woes of Enron Corp that sector is doing fine as a whole My own stray into telecomms components did not last long I was out after months on the back of completely collapsing sales in the US Now I have ventured into Executive Search where I am working as COO for a small group with staff in countries I am not hunting myself but rather involved in corporate issues such as reporting contracts and business development We are hoping to place some Eastern European engineers into a Houston company before long but I am not expecting to have to go there for some time to come You may notice that I am sending this email from a new address I am trying to face out the old one since it has caused me endless problems So in future please use the new one heelas being my wifes maiden name I am very pleased to hear that you are well but would rather hope that you could find an excuse to come to London even if your pipelines do not reach that far All the best Martin Forwarded

NORTHWEST AND SHIPPERS LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF MARKET MANIPULA TION Foster Natural Gas Report Page c Copyright Foster Associates Inc FERC issued an order in midmonth September that set for hearing certain co nsolidated proceedings involving several negotiated rate transactions betwe en PGE Gas Transmission Northwest Corporation RP and various ship pers The Commission believes closer scrutiny is called for because these t ransactions appear to provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiple s in excess of maximum approved tariff rates The Commission had issued a suspension order in each proceeding that among other things directed GTN to explain how it had the firm capacity ava ilable to move gas under the transactions in these proceedings and why its entering into the subject negotiated service agreements did not violat e regulations and policy regarding firm transportation service and negotiat ed rate agreements The new expedited hearing procedures are intended to fu rther explore these matters Pending the outcome GTN must revise both its tariff and capacity availability postings to provide for clear identificati on of operational capacity and must post and contract operational capacity on each day of its availability ie on a daytoday basis unless it c an demonstrate such capacity will be available for some longer period of ti me Questions Same as Those Addressed to Transwestern Earlier FERCs concerns in this case are remarkably similar to FTS deals recently arranged by Transwestern Pipeline Co RP that are now the subject of an expedited hearing and investigation Beginning in January Trans western made a series of eight filings implementing FTS negotiated transa ctions with five shippers The filings were accepted and suspended subject to conditions by orders issued March and and April Staff issued data requests to Transwestern Sempra and Richardson In the March orde r FERC also directed Transwestern to show cause why its negotiated rate tr ansactions did not violate the regulations Transwestern answered that the negotiated rate contracts at issue and any others for that matter would n ot have been any less firm or provided a lower quality of service had shipp ers elected instead to pay the recourse rate Underlying these transactio ns Transwestern said is capacity that becomes available only for a short time In July the Commissioners voted to establish the hearing to further explore Transwestern s negotiated transactions that tied rates to gas spot market price differentials between the California border and producing basins in New Mexico and West Texas For service to the border Sempra Energy Trading Corp Richardson Products Co BP Energy Co Astra Power LLC and Reliant Energy Services elected to pay Transwestern negotiated rates as high as MMBtu compared to a maximum FTS recourse rate of centsMMBtu excl uding surcharges and fuel In Transwestern s case the Commission expressed the belief that closer sc rutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many mu ltiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary Did Trans western withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available und er recourse service in order to make the capacity available under negotiate d rate charges at substantially higher rates See REPORT NO pp Background Beginning in March GTN made a series of separate filings pursuant to its rights to implement various negotiated rate transactions under its FTS Rate Schedule with Sempra Dynegy Marketing and Trade Relian t Energy Services Canada Ltd Western Gas Resources Western Ens erco Energy Inc Mirant Americas Energy Marketing LP BP Ener gy Co and CEG Energy Options Inc The filings were accepted and sus pended subject to further proceedings by orders issued on and The transactions established transportation rates ti ed to natural gas spot market price differentials between the Northwest Pip eline interconnection at Stanfield Oregon and the Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co interconnection at Malin on the Or egonCalifornia border According to the data collected by FERC the negotiated rate transactions w ould yield average daily transportation rates many multiples of the maximum FTS rate approximately MMBtu Stanfield to Malin exclusive of surcharges and fuel based on the publicly reported price differentials at the contract receipt and delivery points during the term of the contracts The Commission initiated additional review procedures to further explore qu estions regarding conditions under which operational transportation capacit y may be available on the GTN system GTN has already told the Commission that all negotiated rate shippers knew service was available at the recourse rate but that these shippers chose t o structure the pricing of their contracts in this distinct fashion anyway Further GTN insists the subject firm capacity was posted as available on the companys website and EBB consistent with the Commissions regulations Pursuant to the suspension order FERC received the following information Sempra clarified that MMBtud of its MMBtud total capacity arrangement with GTN was subscribed at the FTS rate But GTN insists Sem pra requested firm backhaul service with the intent of reversing the path Under the negotiated alternative Sempra was persuaded it would not have to pay reservation charges on the full MDQ for a secondary lower priority re verse path service In its response Sempra asserted it wanted to use the c apacity on a secondary basis and thus chose to negotiate a rate structure t hat would best reflect its price risk profile to account for the fact that the capacity may not be available every day Further Sempra stated that th e gas transported was sold into the daily markets at Malin PGEs citygate or the Southern California border market Dynegys rationale for choosing a rate formula rather than the FTS reco urse rate was to gain additional value from the capacity GTN had suggested it could enter into a negotiated agreement based on the daily indextoind ex spread because the StanfieldMalin spread less fuel did not cover the cost of the FTS recourse rate Based on GTNs information Dynegy believe d the price spread was expected to widen and thereby would give it a prici ng opportunity According to Western it initially sought MMBtud of capacity at t he FTS recourse rate but GTNs response did not allow for the total volu me to be shipped at that rate Instead GTN proposed and Western accepted a nother price option MMBtud at the FTS Recourse Rate and M MBtud at the Negotiated Gas Daily Index Rate Neither Reliant nor Enserco filed a response to the Commissions o rder Mirant cited three reasons for choosing the monthly index spread rather t han the recourse rate the index spread was easily hedged at the tim e the market spread was more desirable and reduction of market risk Mi rant believed there were no other practical options to move gas from Stanfi eld to Malin GTN established four negotiated rate agreements with two different shippe rs BP Energy and CEG Energy The BP Energy agreement was accepted as propo sed but FERC accepted and suspended the CEG Energy agreements subject to r efund and further information Similar to the other parties CEG Energy sta ted that it chose a negotiated rate rather than the recourse rate because i t believed the index spread was less expensive than the FTS recourse rate FERC Has Serious Concerns According to the September order GTNs negotiated rate transactions und er investigation present several serious concerns Even with the addition al information in hand the Commission concludes that the filings raise man y issues that need to be investigated further Accordingly an expedited he aring should explore issues including but not limited to whether the tran sportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an accurate and fair mann er consistent with GTNs tariff whether the rates negotiated by GTN were t he product of an exercise of market power ie did GTN withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service just t o make the capacity available under negotiated higher rates why the shipp ers agreed to these rates when lower recourse rates should have been availa ble and lastly whether the practice of improving a shippers standing in the scheduling process by selling firm transportation to undesirable prima ry points so an alternative point can be nominated is discriminatory agains t interruptible transportation shippers since the alternative point is als o available on a somewhat bestefforts basis Since the negotiated rate transactions also raise concerns regarding GTNs posting procedures and its use of firm service contracts for operational ca pacity the Commission also spelled out the need to require GTN to undertak e immediately certain measures to identify more clearly the operational cap acity available on the GTN system and the period for which such capacity is awarded Finally the Commission discovered discrepancies between GTN and the other negotiated parties representations regarding the capacity quantities avail able at the FTS recourse rate Specifically FERCs concerns go to the Se mpra and Western rate agreements whereby the parties initially desired MMBtud at the recourse rate but were provided with a combination of rec ourse service and a negotiated service These actions by GTN may reflect th e exercise of market power and manipulation of the capacity market
