for to long Basically the regulato r is violating the terms of our license because it is not convenient for th e government to follow our license It is a case of the Government trying to fix its inflation problems on the backs of the regulated companies and in t he process there are doing further damage to the economy Impact on TGS is about mm of revenue and we have ceased to authorize ne w investments From my perspective we have clear BIT case but I prefer to wait until we have run out of more conventional options Also the BIT arbirtration on Stamp Tax is starting and I I dont want to have two cases going at the same time if I can avoid it Eduardo and I will be working with US embassy in Argentina they have indicated that push from Washington DC would help termendously I will get the the memo in the first attachment translated and send to you hopefully on monday Aslo Eduardo will be putting together some more info on TGS specific impact As the meeting between Colin Powell and Argentine ambassador is on Feb thought it would be good to get you guys up to spe ed and as I think this is going to be a bit of a drawn out process would lik e your assistance in putting together plan for getting the Argentine governme nt to correct this mistake I would like to arrange a call on Wednesday afternoon the st to discuss Can you please let me know who should be invited from the DC office Yvette please send first attachment and the SP press release out for Translation and then send directly to Linda and Joe Also please schedul e a meeting with Linda Joe and Eduardo for Wednesday afternoon if it is convenient for them otherwise anytime after that Pete Forwarded by Peter E WeidlerNAEnron on AM Eduardo GS AM To Peter E NRON cc Subject RE TGS PPI Pete Last Wednesday January I held a meeting at the US Embassy with Jim Wilson Counselor for Commercial Matters and Douglas Climan Counselor for Economic Affairs I believe that the meeting was highly positive since it gave the chance to let them know the PPI issue in detail to make them clear some points of th e process and of the PPI working and to provide them with information about t he topic They showed themselves very interested in taking action to help us with the National Government and to such end we have agreed the following a Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini the Argentine Foreign Affairs Minister will meet with Collin Powell in Washington next February They will try to include this subject in the agenda at least to cover it generally b They will send to Washington the information that I gave to them in orde r to be submitted to the Argentine Ambassador in US by an Enron officer there c They will clearly speak about this issue at the regular meetings that th ey hold at the Economy Ministry especially with Machinea where they are aske d cooperation for attracting American investments to Argentina d They will transmit this subject to the American Ambassador in Argentina and a meeting will be agreed if necessary e We will be in continuous contact to keep them informed about the process and they will inform us about the actions that they may be taking They mentioned among other subjects the meeting that would be held that afternoon between F Mezzadri CMS President and TGSshareholder an d Ambassador Welch Although the topic of the meeting was Stamp Tax they also will include the PPI issue Finally they mentioned that the US Embassy regularly organizes a meeting during the first week of April with American companies holding investments in Argentina members of the commercial areas of the Embassy and officers comi ng from US They recommended us to participate at such meeting also with someone from Enron in US since that is a good opportunity for them to know the commercial matters with the Government At the end of the meeting Climan mentioned that it would be interesting to organize a visit of Ambassador Welch to TGS facilities in the interior of t he country For that purpose we have agreed that I would prepare a tentative trip program to visit not only some facilities but also some working areas where expansion works are being performed In principle they let us to propose the date and they also mentioned the possibility of including in th e trip some visit to a Provincial Governor I am working on that and I will send you a draft of the program as soon as I have it I think that if this visit is carried out it would be good to do it with Enron and Perez Companc s officers Attached you will find the information that I gave to Doug and Jim for you send it to Washington
