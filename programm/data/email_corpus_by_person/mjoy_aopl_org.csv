NOTES NO PIPELINE NOTES FROM WASHINGTON Vol No December Association of Oil Pipe Lines fax The opinions if any expressed in these notes are the authors only and do not represent the views of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines but they should Joint Pipeline Associations Meet with Secretary Mineta On Monday December along with the natural gas transmission and distribution trade associations we met with Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta to pledge the full support of the joint pipeline associations for enactment of pipeline safety reauthorization legislation in the th Congress Joe Monroe of Unocal and Tom Miesner of Conoco represented the liquid pipeline associations The Secretary was very pleased and we think relieved to see the pipeline industry united behind a common set of proposals He committed to working with us to facilitate passage of an acceptable bill in the House which is the next step The proactive stance of the combined industry associations on reauthorization legislation is essentially CEO driven and organizing it has been largely the work of Joe Monroe Captain for GasLiquid Relations Team of the AOPLAPI Joint Environmental and Safety Initiative We also urged the Secretary to expedite issuance of the four liquid rules that AOPL and API wrote to him about on December See the letter on the AOPL website at newsMinetarulesletterpdf repair criteria for integrity management the Integrity rule of small lines the corrosion rule update and the revised incident reporting rule These four complete an impressive series of new rules for liquid pipelines begun after the Bellingham accident in June DOT hopes to have all four out by yearend This series of provides powerful evidence that OPS regulation of pipeline safety is neither lax nor inadequate Pipeline Safety Legislation Introduced in the House On Thursday December shortly before Congress recessed for the ChristmasNew Years break key House members introduced HR the Pipeline Infrastructure Protection To Enhance Security and Safety Act The bill was introduced by Rep Don Young RAK Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and cosponsored by Rep Billy Tauzin RLA Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Thomas Petri RWI Joe Barton RTX Gene Green DTX Brad Carson DOK Max Sandlin DTX and Ralph Hall DTX Rep Petri and Rep Barton chair subcommittees that will hold the hearings on the bill in these two committees It is highly significant that the sponsorship of this bill includes both of the House committees that claim jurisdiction over pipeline safety It will be very helpful to have these committees cooperating rather than fighting with each other The bipartisan cosponsorship of the bill is also significant Passage of a reasonable bill depends on cooperation across party lines and this is an excellent start If the House is to pass a pipeline safety bill in this Congress HR will be the vehicle The bill is a serious effort with new provisions not seen before The text of the bill will be posted on the Library of Congress website If you need a copy sooner let us know and well send one to you This bill is the starting point for the pipeline safety debate in the House It is significantly different from the bipartisan Senate passed pipeline safety bill S authored by Sen John McCain RAZ and others HR incorporates post security considerations and doesnt attempt to write into law desired actions on pipeline integrity management that have already taken or are in process by the Office of Pipeline Safety The task for the House the Administration and the industry now will be to review the provisions of the introduced bill improve on them where needed build a consensus in support of the basic bill and if necessary to achieve a critical mass of support for passage add additional provisions Look for hearings to begin in February probably leading off with a general oversight hearing on the issues followed by hearings on the bill itself The Transportation and Infrastructure Committees press release on introduction is at transportation Department of Energy Conference on Security of Energy Facilities On December the Department of Energy hosted a conference with representatives of state governments and the energy industry associations to discuss energy security assurance reliability and energy emergency

of publication in the Federal Register We will let you know when that occurs In the interim you can take a look at this proposed rule by going to QCIPSRULESRMRMTXT We also need to understand how much our member companies will be impacted by this rulemaking Please give us your thoughts Red Butte Depreciation Order Issued The Commission approved a depreciation rate of for Red Butte Red Butte had

and opinions Given the number of different forms in which these orders and opinions are published both electronically and in paper accurate citation to the body of Commission orders is difficult To resolve the issue the Commission has decided to adopt internal paragraph numbering with the goal of creating uniform citation that will reference these paragraphs To learn more about this initiative go to QCIPSMISCCACAATXT Commission Revises Gas Pipeline Outreach Requirements The FERC has been struggling with how to improve communications with landowners about prospective gas pipeline projects It has been come up with a number of proposals including significant prefiling communications requirements Now the Commission staff has developed a report entitled Ideas For Better Stakeholder Involvement In The Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Planning PreFiling Process The report can be downloaded from the FERC website at wwwfercgov or requested by email at gas This FERC initiative does not apply to oil pipelines but does indicate what the FERC expects of gas pipeline sponsors The Staff is also planning a series of workshops in the new year to bring interstate natural gas companies and Federal state and local agency representatives and landowners together to discuss implementation of stakeholder involvement programs For more on this initiative go to QCIPSMISCMMSMSTXT Platte
