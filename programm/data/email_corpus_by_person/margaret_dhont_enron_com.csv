moment wethey get confirmation on the nomination Try to get other bids to validate as best you can Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to asking permission is not advisable Original Message From Germany Chris Sent Wednesday March PM To McMichael Jr Ed Concannon Ruth Cc Parks Joe Garza Maria Mann Kay Olinger Kimberly S Sanchez Christina Polsky Phil Shemin V Proctor Email Dhont Margaret Subject Sonat Park Loan Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat This is what we have found out over the last days ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonats scheduling Christina Sanchez ENA Scheduler believes that under normal conditions we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it I need to know What volume to sell I assume we are talking about dth on deal which means we ignore the loaned volume of dth on deal What period do I sell the gas for All out by March st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline Or base load in April I prefer all out by March st but I would like to ask the pipeline if thats ok How many bids do I need to get I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January see items in red down below Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas I dont want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it All of my previous notes are shown below in blue Summary Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance dth per my conversation with Sonat to offset ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October According to Sonat the payment was due November but ENA did not pay Sonats motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March th History Per Dave Dyer at Sonat ENA has Park Loan PAL contracts with Sonat All PALs with Sonat are under master contract PAL Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract Deal ENA borrowed a total of dth from Nov rdth and has not paid this back ENA still owes Sonat dth The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with days notice on any days on SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA FOR THIS DEAL because Sonat needed to get gas off the system Deal ENA parked dth in August to come out in Jan Sonat let ENA withdraw on leaving a balance of dth In Jan ENA withdrew dth per day for the stth That left a balance of dth On Jan th Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset the Loaned gas on deal dth and to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October According to Sonat the remaining balance on this deal is dth parked in Aug wd in Nov wd in Jan balance on According to Sonats letter Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets According to Dave ENA is being billed x daily balance in this account ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August Other items ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October ENA purchased at an average price of According to Sonat ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy ENA also sold Sonat gas dth day at sitara in January and dth day at in May sitara ENA used dth of the parked gas on deal to supply the dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park ENA defaulted on dth of the Sonat deal in January Sonats in house legal counsel is Patti Frances I left a message for Patti to call me Patti Frances returned my call Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March th I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the dth dth per day for Jan st th that ENA did supply Patti said she didnt think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed She will check on it and call me back Per Kay Mann Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract PM Left a followup message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on Per Ruth Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal Christina Sanchez ENA Scheduler will find out if we still have access to Sonats EBB and if we can nominate the gas out of the PALs Per Christina ENAs IDs and passwords have been cancelled Christina called Barbara Gilbert ENAs account rep at Sonat Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonats legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PALs meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream PM Tammi Depaolis at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out PM Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonats legal department
