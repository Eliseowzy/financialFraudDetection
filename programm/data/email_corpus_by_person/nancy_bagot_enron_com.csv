<14592006.1075858861541.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,nancy.bagot@enron.com,2001-10-24 15:54:59,Summary of Commission MeetingAt the October FERC Sunshine meeting the following items were di scussed Kern River Firm Customers Rehearing Request Denied C C on agenda Called by Linda Breathitt these are two Kern River expansion applications CA Action Project CP Expansion CP that have received certificates The draft orders deny rehearing requests by Firm Customers w ho charge that additions will cause further pro rata allocations at Wheele r Ridge The draft order states that the benefits of the project outweigh any potential adverse impact to existing customers and that the solutio n to the problem of pro rata curtailments at Wheeler Ridge lies not with in terstate pipelines but with resolving the problems of takeaway capacity o n SoCalGas Hence the orders reason that Kern River has satisfied its o bligations to its customers and the current lack of intrastate capacity c annot be laid at Kern Rivers door Breathitt is filing concurrences to these two orders to highlight the impor tant issue of FERCs response to intervener allegations of insufficient tak eaway capacity related to interstate expansions Though Breathitt doesnt dissent from the rehearing denial she wants to underscore the importance of the Commissions acknowledgement of the role that possible degradation o f existing rights plays in the determination of the public need and necessi ty for pipeline expansions She also states that she is uneasy about FER Cs strident policies in favor of adding pipeline facilities despite poss ible inefficiencies and constraints and she reiterates that FERCs mandate under the NGA goes beyond making sure pipeline gets into the ground She notes that the Commission will revisit the takeaway capacity issue in anot her Kern River expansion application CP Expansion Project Brownell Calls for Development of Regional State Relations Panels under Aus pice of Electricity Market Design and Structure NOPR RM E on age nda Though the issuance of a NOPR is not apparently imminent under this discu ssion item Nora Brownell announced that she has sent a memo to the other th ree Commissioners recommending the development of some internal structure t o coordinate communications between FERC and state commissions The need f or such coordination emerged from obvious frustration expressed by state co mmissioners during RTO Week To get this process going Commissioner Brown ell asked staff to pursue a structure perhaps a type of regional panel wi th the mission to strengthen federalsate relationships Considering the m agnitude of RTO development FERC likely will need to have dedicated staff work on this Chairman Wood requested that Dan Larcamp Director of OMTR bring a proposal to the Commission at the next meeting on how to implement a structure While all three other Commissioners supported Brownells prop osal Commissioner Massey noted that theres already been seven years of p rocess and input on RTO formation and that any new structure should be dev eloped in a way that gets us to an endgame concretely and clearly Western Infrastructure Reports Lay Baseline for FERC Adequacy Conference in Seattle Staff presented multiple detailed reports on data and background material g athered to lay the groundwork for discussions at next months Western Infra structure Adequacy Conference in Seattle on November similar conferences will be held regionally across the country The conference is a FERC factfinding mission which will seek to answer three primary questions Is the current energy infrastructure in the West adequate What are the infrastructure needs for the region What factors inhibit investment in the development of adequate energy infrastructure While the presentations seem to focus primarily on electric transmission t he conference will cover all energy delivery systems The overriding quest ion on all fronts is what needs to be done and who needs to do it The po werpoint presentations made by Staff are already available on FERCs websit e at calendarcommissionmeetingsdiscussionpapershtm RTO Week Update Staff updated the Commissioners and public on the week of RTO panels held a t FERC last week Staff is preparing and organizing a document outlining what Staff heard which will be posted on FERCs website this week The d ocument is intended to give focus to reply comments from stakeholders Sta ff also suggested that there may be a need to hold smaller more focused St aff sessions to dig deeper According to Staff while there seemed to b e some consensus at the mile high level more specific issues emerge d which may require further discussion Lengthy Updates and Discussion on Two RTO Mediations Southeast Northeast Midwest RTO Progress In the Northeast and Southeast RTO mediation cases Staff and the mediating Judges briefed the Commissioners on where the ordered mediations left off what proposals and options are now on the table and what next steps may b e necessary These mediation reports will be available online by end of w eek What is not clear is when the Commission is going to vote on RTOs there were no votes at the meeting only discussion In the Midwest both MISO and ARTO are ready for operations and MISO and S PP are also prepared to merge While Commissioners discussed specifics of all the Midwest proposals again no vote was taken or any indication given as to when a vote may occur ETS Draft Orders Issued Northern Natural RP Northerns Limited Firm Transportation LFT tariff sheets were approved

Firm Customers Rehearing Request Denied C C on agenda Called by Linda Breathitt these are two Kern River expansion applications CA Action Project CP Expansion CP that have received certificates The draft orders deny rehearing requests by Firm Customers w ho charge that additions will cause further pro rata allocations at Wheele r Ridge The draft order states that the benefits of the project outweigh any potential adverse impact to existing customers and that the solutio n to the problem of pro rata curtailments at Wheeler Ridge lies not with in terstate pipelines but with resolving the problems of takeaway capacity o n SoCalGas Hence the orders reason that Kern River has satisfied its o bligations to its customers and the current lack of intrastate capacity c annot be laid at Kern Rivers door Breathitt is filing concurrences to these two orders to highlight the impor tant issue of FERCs response to intervener allegations of insufficient tak eaway capacity related to interstate expansions Though Breathitt doesnt dissent from the rehearing denial she wants to underscore the importance of the Commissions acknowledgement of the role that possible degradation o f existing rights plays in the determination of the public need and necessi ty for pipeline expansions She also states that she is uneasy about FER Cs strident policies in favor of adding pipeline facilities despite poss ible inefficiencies and constraints and she reiterates that FERCs mandate under the NGA goes beyond making sure pipeline gets into the ground She notes that the Commission will revisit the takeaway capacity issue in anot her Kern River expansion application CP Expansion Project Brownell Calls for Development of Regional State Relations Panels under Aus pice of Electricity Market Design and Structure NOPR RM E on age nda Though the issuance of a NOPR is not apparently imminent under this discu ssion item Nora Brownell announced that she has sent a memo to the other th ree Commissioners recommending the development of some internal structure t o coordinate communications between FERC and state commissions The need f or such coordination emerged from obvious frustration expressed by state co mmissioners during RTO Week To get this process going Commissioner Brown ell asked staff to pursue a structure perhaps a type of regional panel wi th the mission to strengthen federalsate relationships Considering the m agnitude of RTO development FERC likely will need to have dedicated staff work on this Chairman Wood requested that Dan Larcamp Director of OMTR bring a proposal to the Commission at the next meeting on how to implement a structure While all three other Commissioners supported Brownells prop osal Commissioner Massey noted that theres already been seven years of p rocess and input on RTO formation and that any new structure should be dev eloped in a way that gets us to an endgame concretely and clearly Western Infrastructure Reports Lay Baseline for FERC Adequacy Conference in Seattle Staff presented multiple detailed reports on data and background material g athered to lay the groundwork for discussions at next months Western Infra structure Adequacy Conference in Seattle on November similar conferences will be held regionally across the country The conference is a FERC factfinding mission which will seek to answer three primary questions Is the current energy infrastructure in the West adequate What are the infrastructure needs for the region What factors inhibit investment in the development of adequate energy infrastructure While the presentations seem to focus primarily on electric transmission t he conference will cover all energy delivery systems The overriding quest ion on all fronts is what needs to be done and who needs to do it The po werpoint presentations made by Staff are already available on FERCs websit e at calendarcommissionmeetingsdiscussionpapershtm RTO Week Update Staff updated the Commissioners and public on the week of RTO panels held a t FERC last week Staff is preparing and organizing a document outlining what Staff heard which will be posted on FERCs website this week The d ocument is intended to give focus to reply comments from stakeholders Sta ff also suggested that there may be a need to hold smaller more focused St aff sessions to dig deeper According to Staff while there seemed to b e some consensus at the mile high level more specific issues emerge d which may require further discussion Lengthy Updates and Discussion on Two RTO Mediations Southeast Northeast Midwest RTO Progress In the Northeast and Southeast RTO mediation cases Staff and the mediating Judges briefed the Commissioners on where the ordered mediations left off what proposals and options are now on the table and what next steps may b e necessary These mediation reports will be available online by end of w eek What is not clear is when the Commission is going to vote on RTOs there were no votes at the meeting only discussion In the Midwest both MISO and ARTO are ready for operations and MISO and S PP are also prepared to merge While Commissioners discussed specifics of all the Midwest

Meeting More detailed summaries and analysis of the attendant orders will be included in the Weekly Report next week or may be sent out as supplemental reports as the orders are issued OFO Presentation and Discussion GX Item G In a Power Point presentation Staff discussed OFOs citing past customer concerns that gave rise to Order revisions and recommending further remedies in the form of monitoring mechanisms see bullets from presentation below The crux of the discussion among the three Commissioners Commissioner Massey was absent due to illness is that FERC will monitor pipeline OFO habits proactively to look for patterns of abuse on particular systems Such a pattern could the need for additional facilities to alleviate constraint points Commissioner Breathitt agreed to the approach outlined but indicated that it would be prudent to allow Order revisions time to work She noted that the issue is and has been pipeline specific not industrywide Commissioner Brownell also clarified that though the monitoring mechanism through EBB postings and reports to Commission is new the Commission has not seen a recent pattern of abuse the mechanism is designed to anticipate future problems Presentation bullets Commissions Goals Ensure reliable service Minimize OFOs maximize market forces and customer flexibility Give shippers information needed Monitor OFO abuse to identify system constrain points Initiatives to Achieve Goals Order to enhance market design rules Market monitoring Necessary infrastructure additions OFO Definition Issued by pipelines to maintain service reliability Can be systemwide or limited to specific pipeline segments Typically restricts use for receiptdelivery points Requires shippers to stay in balance at tightened tolerance levels OFO Addressed in Order Too ill defined too large in scope Remains in effect too long Market affiliates unduly benefit Shippers not informed on timely manner Level of OFO penalties excessive Order Remedies Better define OFO Develop a continuum of emergency measures Timely inform shippers of OFO Set proper OFO penalty level and credit revenues to shippers Require OFO activity report Market Monitoring Staff will oversee OFO activity Oversight will rely on EBB postings pipeline reports and other sources Efficient and Effective Collection of DataGX Item G Chairman Wood called this item for discussion in response to queries from the American Public Gas Association APGA about what actual market data is generally available for the natural gas industry This issue came out in part due to the AGA storage data error that occurred a month or so ago APGA suggests the following information be available Production Production capability and resulting utilization rate based on and Pipeline capacity Operational capacity and resulting utilization rate based on and Enduse by customer class Because of the AGA hiccup on its data storage numbers Chairman Wood would like to see more than one data source for important market information though it may not be FERCs job to collect such data Commissioner Brownell suggested the establishment of a stakeholder group to determine what kind of information is needed if any information is collected and not used and how collected information will serve the market Staff noted that several information collection items are being developed for the FERC Business Plan and the APGA list may be incorporated into that effort East Tennessee Expansion for new generation CP Item C This case in which an East Tennessee expansion to serve a new generation load is approved was called by Chairman Wood in response to a specific issue raised by APGA APGA is concerned that the proliferation of pipeline projects to serve generation are being approved without consideration of the resultant impact on the nations gas customers that impact being the exacerbation of natural gas prices across the board Chairman Wood said he wanted to clarify publicly that as stated in the order it is not FERCs job to decide why any person needs gasthe public is best served when the market dictates price and supply He pointed out that the Commissions certificate policy is very direct and clear on risk and he is comfortable with that state of affairs Generation Interconnection EX Item E The Commission agreed to establish a Straw Man model probably using the ERCOT model to modify generation interconnection procedures service agreements and rights This process will precede a NOPR that will establish interconnection standards to alleviate complaints constrictions and delays in processes Once the Straw Man method is finalized the NOPR will have an accelerated process in which to comment reply and implement in a final rule This is Step One of the process with Step Two to be a subsequent and separate NOPR to examine and resolve the cost responsibility issues related to interconnection standards The Commissioners agreed that splitting the financial aspect out into a separate proceeding will allow for an easy win on the establishment of standards Cost issues include a allocation between generators and providers and b common costs recoverable across all users Carolina Power Light ER Item E Chairman Wood called this case for discussion to highlight a change in Commission policy In this case FERC is imposing the gas model for penalty revenue crediting to electric transmission providers Described as a market based imbalance solution the prospective change requires that revenues from imbalance penalties should be credited back to nonoffending

Firm Customers Rehearing Request Denied C C on agenda Called by Linda Breathitt these are two Kern River expansion applications CA Action Project CP Expansion CP that have received certificates The draft orders deny rehearing requests by Firm Customers w ho charge that additions will cause further pro rata allocations at Wheele r Ridge The draft order states that the benefits of the project outweigh any potential adverse impact to existing customers and that the solutio n to the problem of pro rata curtailments at Wheeler Ridge lies not with in terstate pipelines but with resolving the problems of takeaway capacity o n SoCalGas Hence the orders reason that Kern River has satisfied its o bligations to its customers and the current lack of intrastate capacity c annot be laid at Kern Rivers door Breathitt is filing concurrences to these two orders to highlight the impor tant issue of FERCs response to intervener allegations of insufficient tak eaway capacity related to interstate expansions Though Breathitt doesnt dissent from the rehearing denial she wants to underscore the importance of the Commissions acknowledgement of the role that possible degradation o f existing rights plays in the determination of the public need and necessi ty for pipeline expansions She also states that she is uneasy about FER Cs strident policies in favor of adding pipeline facilities despite poss ible inefficiencies and constraints and she reiterates that FERCs mandate under the NGA goes beyond making sure pipeline gets into the ground She notes that the Commission will revisit the takeaway capacity issue in anot her Kern River expansion application CP Expansion Project Brownell Calls for Development of Regional State Relations Panels under Aus pice of Electricity Market Design and Structure NOPR RM E on age nda Though the issuance of a NOPR is not apparently imminent under this discu ssion item Nora Brownell announced that she has sent a memo to the other th ree Commissioners recommending the development of some internal structure t o coordinate communications between FERC and state commissions The need f or such coordination emerged from obvious frustration expressed by state co mmissioners during RTO Week To get this process going Commissioner Brown ell asked staff to pursue a structure perhaps a type of regional panel wi th the mission to strengthen federalsate relationships Considering the m agnitude of RTO development FERC likely will need to have dedicated staff work on this Chairman Wood requested that Dan Larcamp Director of OMTR bring a proposal to the Commission at the next meeting on how to implement a structure While all three other Commissioners supported Brownells prop osal Commissioner Massey noted that theres already been seven years of p rocess and input on RTO formation and that any new structure should be dev eloped in a way that gets us to an endgame concretely and clearly Western Infrastructure Reports Lay Baseline for FERC Adequacy Conference in Seattle Staff presented multiple detailed reports on data and background material g athered to lay the groundwork for discussions at next months Western Infra structure Adequacy Conference in Seattle on November similar conferences will be held regionally across the country The conference is a FERC factfinding mission which will seek to answer three primary questions Is the current energy infrastructure in the West adequate What are the infrastructure needs for the region What factors inhibit investment in the development of adequate energy infrastructure While the presentations seem to focus primarily on electric transmission t he conference will cover all energy delivery systems The overriding quest ion on all fronts is what needs to be done and who needs to do it The po werpoint presentations made by Staff are already available on FERCs websit e at calendarcommissionmeetingsdiscussionpapershtm RTO Week Update Staff updated the Commissioners and public on the week of RTO panels held a t FERC last week Staff is preparing and organizing a document outlining what Staff heard which will be posted on FERCs website this week The d ocument is intended to give focus to reply comments from stakeholders Sta ff also suggested that there may be a need to hold smaller more focused St aff sessions to dig deeper According to Staff while there seemed to b e some consensus at the mile high level more specific issues emerge d which may require further discussion Lengthy Updates and Discussion on Two RTO Mediations Southeast Northeast Midwest RTO Progress In the Northeast and Southeast RTO mediation cases Staff and the mediating Judges briefed the Commissioners on where the ordered mediations left off what proposals and options are now on the table and what next steps may b e necessary These mediation reports will be available online by end of w eek What is not clear is when the Commission is going to vote on RTOs there were no votes at the meeting only discussion In the Midwest both MISO and ARTO are ready for operations and MISO and S PP are also prepared to merge While Commissioners discussed specifics of all the Midwest proposals again no vote was taken or any indication given as to when a vote may occur ETS Draft Orders Issued Northern Natural RP Northerns Limited Firm Transportation LFT tariff sheets were approved

FacilityPlanning Seminar Presentation of Staffs Findings October Washington DC Link to Ideas document gasstakeholderpdf Comments due on prefiling stakeholder Ideas document November Overriding theme to all Action Ideas is earlier is better Prefiling process has a new docket prefix PF and is underway explained in some detail Staff seems to be looking for best practices possibly even a vehicle for industrywide and public sharing Highlights Though FERCs Office of Energy Projects intends to hold more public and industry outreach seminars this sixth seminar was the last of this series OEP presented their final draft of Ideas for Better Stakeholder Involvement in the Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Planning PreFiling Process Industry Agencies Citizens and FERC Staff Following this presentation there is one last round of comments on the document due to the Outreach Team by November th The Outreach Teams goal is to release a final document by the end of this year Overall the Team wants to know if theyre findings are on target and they have asked for comments that include edits additions or omissions To note however is that The Ideas is seen as a living document by OEP and it will be changed and updated on an ongoing basis as better practices and ideas emerge Again Rich Hoffmann stated that there is no intention for any of this to be included in a rulemaking or policy statement I believed him this time Also Rich clarified that we recognize these ideas have to be customized for every project This is in fact why the document was not issued as guidelines industry argued they would become de facto requirements For comment on the document itself we will look for ETS recommendations from interested groups there is a link to the document above At the end of this memo there is also a list of general questions from the Outreach Team Please send replies or comments on those questions as well as the Ideas document to me by November th for aggregation and inclusion in informal comments to go to the Outreach team comments will not be filed with the Secretary FERC Staff Presentation The Gas Outreach Team Rich Hoffmann Lauren ODonnell Jeff Shenot Howard Wheeler presented their findings of Action Options for the four major stakeholder sectors Pipeline Industry Agency local state and resource agencies Citizen and FERC Staff There is a slide presentation that should be made available online soon There was some QA but Staff was particularly eager to hear examples of how some of these ideas have been implemented successfully and if any best practices have emerged since the Outreach Team began these discussions One worry we have with Staffs preoccupation with best practices is that at some point they may want to formalize that idea though the publication of best practices They seem to be looking for a vehicle to collect and communicate best practices from pipeline company to pipeline company and to the public Similar to the idea of publishing guidelines which then become de facto requirements best practices can evolve into requirements as well and such practices vary widely in use and effectiveness across different systems projects and regions of the country Industry may want to protect the importance of variability and customization of approach based on what we know about certain regions and populations Some points of interest from the discussion include the emphasis by FERC Staff that pipeline companies appear to be most successful when they get full management support from the top at the very beginning of project development there is a proactive companywide philosophy and the project team includes various parts of the company from the outset ie include public affairs from the beginning as well as engineering and have them communicate with each other regularly through the team NEPA PreFiling Process Attesting to the emerging role of the NEPA Prefiling Process there is a new docket prefix PF instituted to allow for public access to information on prefiled projects This process is not an expedited approach that takes less time at FERC but instead overlays the companys timeline with the FERC NEPA timeline in the development and assessment of the project This allows for a certificate sooner for the company in relation to their own project development process As an example a NEPA PreFiling process could begin before the exact route has been determined though the project must be welldefined while the company is holding public meetings and choosing the route FERC could begin the scoping process According to OEPs assessment this could shift the NEPA process back as much as seven months Under this scenario once the company files for its certificate application a final certificate could be issued in under ten months In order to use the prefiling process companies must meet certain qualifications First a company should be prepared to fund a third party contractor to help FERC Staff prepare the certificate and NEPA requirements Also there must be a real written commitment to identify and resolve issues And the company must be able to demonstrate that the other major NEPA organizations are prepared to cooperate on development of the NEPA assessment To qualify to use the NEPA prefiling the company files a formal request with the OEP Director answering any concerns FERC Staff may have about the project and the outlook for a successful prefiling process Once accepted that would trigger the PF docket assignment Currently only the NiSource Greenbriar project is utilizing this process FollowUp Questions from FERC Along with any comments we may have on the Ideas document itself FERC Staff distributed a set of three questions for consideration andor comment from industry and the public The questions follow note that Staff is particularly eager to collect positive anecdotes on how these ideas are already working on projects Part Are we on target Please let us know of any additions omissions or editorial changes you recommend for Ideas for Better Stakeholder Involvement Part Ideas for implementation Please give us your good ideas about how to put the ideas discussed here today to work This can be for projects you are involved with or for other projects of which you are aware Part Examples of successful implementation Please describe examples of how using these concepts helped make your experience or involvement with a project better
