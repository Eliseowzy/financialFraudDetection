Points Bulletin on Kevin Watlers bike was cancelled last monthand the reward went unclaimed He found the bike himself Amnesia Senility Well know soon enough But on the other hand I have had three bikes stolen in an eight week span So right now I have no bike and its pissing me off I thought I lived in a nice neighborhood obviously I was sadly mistaken Bike thieves are running rampant on the Keizersgracht Visitors Beware There has been a fair amount of drinking going on in Amsterdam this summerhere are some highlights Doug Kevin Watler and Tinhead left a club in Sweden got in a cab and ended up in Copenhagen Denmark Im pretty sure the cab driver ripped us off but I was involved so that shouldnt surprise anyone One pluswe saw a beautiful sunrise Simon left the Supper Club a few weeks ago and was later found by Watler laying on his back on a canal bridge and singing to himselfI wasnt there but the rumor is he was singing Its Raining Men But you didnt hear that from me Three weeks ago most of the German Electricity Desk took out clients to the Okura Hotel for sushi We all brought dates my date was not impressed Ill tell you whyfor starters we all got bombed on hot Sake After dinner we were started on cocktails We all decided to go to the Supper Club for some more drinks I got up to go to the bathroom before we left UnfortunatelyI walked into a wall instead So surprisingly enough I got into the cab that was going to Keizersgracht not the cab that was going to the Supper Club with Simon In hind sight I think I made the right callsee story above about Simon same night Eric Pierce has been having trouble riding his bike drunk this summer He recently has ridden into the tram tracks and flipped over his handle bars A stunt that should not be attempted stone cold sober let alone under the influence of alcoholon a another occasion he drove his bike into a wall Kathryn and I are discussing the possibility of putting training wheels on his bicycleIll let you know what we decide Speaking of bike ridingKevin and Missy were riding back from a bar and it started pouring down rain I mean pouring So they stopped by my apartment to get out of the rain I was in Corsica but Eric and Katherine were there Apparently the four of them found the my robe and the guest robes and had a Robe Party Im hoping to hear the real story before I dieIm not holding my breath Shockingly enough that was not the last party to be had at my apartment in my absence Missy and I cooked a dinner party for twelve people two weeks ago at my place Im pretty sure everyone would agree that it was a huge success Only one little slip upMissy and I forgot to serve our guests the green tea ice cream we made from scratch that afternoon But dont worry we didnt forget to meet in the kitchen between courses and eat the ice cream ourselvesoh yeah we planned that the whole time Anyway I passed out at about midnight from what I was told the party ended at about in the morning A very similar thing happened last Saturday night but then again all of last week was a little out of control Ill leave last weeks stories antics for the next update trust me they are worth the wait I have an update from

But then again I havent heard one peep out of of you on this email list so sorry to say this will be your last Update All of the dead beats are getting dropped YOU KNOW WHO I AM TALKING ABOUT Oh and dont bother emailing me with a bunch of excuses youre getting dropped and thats that Maybe I kiddingmaybe Im not Well lets get everyone caught up This is going to be a long one so get comfortablethe last two months has involved a lot of travelling Ive been to Switzerland sailing in the North Sea London twice as per usual Monaco New York twice for two weddings also no surprise and Spain Ill recap a few of my journeys for everyone Id like to start with my trip to London I went to my first real Cricket match England vs Pakistan Unfortunately I went with clients that knew much more than I did about the sport The traders of Axia Energy easily took me for A word of advice for my American friends do not bet on English sports that you dont know anything about You would have figured that I had known that Sometimes my stupidity even surprises meOkay Axia you got me this time well see what happens this weekend at the American Football match in Amsterdam The following weekend I was off to the French Riviera and the Monaco Grand Prixintense sporting event Mind numbingly loud beautiful weather and a great night in the casino Although its official my French sucks Six years of French in school and I barely know how to ask for a glass of water Im not happy about that Oh Speaking of languages I have enrolled in formal Dutch lessons with a few guys from the desk Classes begin in September twice a week two hours a night for two months I cant wait for the Update after the final Yes there is a final Any way lets continue My next weekend brought back home to New York City and Bob and Stephanies wedding Congratulations you two I think you should be back from your honeymoon by now Anyway beautiful event very happy I was asked to be a part of it Great to see a lot of old friends Andas promised I did not have to find a hidden place to take a nap Dave and Felice I still feel bad about that While on the wedding thinglast weekend I returned home for hours to attend Deirdra and Penns wedding Surprisingly enough I stayed awake for this one too In all fairness it was easy it was a day wedding Which was very helpful Anyway those two are in the Caribbean having a blast Im sure Not me its pm and Im in my office writing this stupid email I think Im going to set up a cot behind my desk I have to mention a little trip I took in between weddingsa bunch of the Prebons European managers had an offsite meeting in the South of Spain Malaga to be exact It was suppose to be in Barcelona but thats a whole different story I think Ill leave that part of the story out AnywayI have learned a few things about travelling lately especially about air travel We all know I fly a lot I mean a lot I have a new rule avoid crappy airlines like the plague Its just not worth it Airlines to avoid while in EuropeBasic Air with that name alone I should have known better Luxair actually I can take that one step further avoid Luxembourg airport and any flight that flies there Ill elaboratewhy wouldnt IFirst of all I take KLM to Luxembourg no problems there and I have to transfer to a Luxair flight that will be taking me to Malaga Well after waiting on line with a bunch of old rude people we pile into a bus We wait in the hot sweaty bus for minutes finally the bus leaves I kid you not we the bus ride was feet long I was in shock Dont worry it gets worseI squeeze into my seat I think there was nine inches centimeters of leg room Every single seat is occupied Miraculously I fall asleepbut not for long The flight attendant wakes me up from a dead sleep in order to serve me my meal Im using that term loosely So now Im awake which Im not happy about and I have the scariest pate in front of me Ive ever seen It looked so bad I had to try it For the first time in my life I almost had to employ the air sickness bag It was horrible I do have to mention there was one good thingafter the meal they did serve complimentary cognac which was nice Quick frankly I felt they owed to me but I was thankful none the less There is something else that bothered me but it nothing to do with Luxair Now that I have almost been poisoned I knew that there was no chance for me to fall back asleep So I start reading the book I brought with me The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe Well in the end I found the book entertaining but I have one major problem with it Im reading about this guy Lawrence Kramer who is on his way to the court house in the Bronx hes an Assistant District Attorney and Tom Wolfe has this guy getting on the D train at st street and Central Park West Duh Everybody knows that on the upper west side the D train and the A train are both express from th Street to th Street The only west side local train that stops at st Street and the Bronx Courthouse st Street is the B train and sometimes the C train I know Im being a little petty but give me a break the author claims to reside in New York City I read the back cover get your facts straight pal Tomorrow Im off the European World Bowl American Football with clients I have a feeling my high school team could beat either team but it should be fun none the lesswell see I would like to welcome the following people into the worldVanessa Malhame Joel Kabel and Melissa Moore my new niece who was just born on Wednesday night Thats it until next timeEnjoy your summer Douglas Pursel Moore This
