emailemailalertscfm Toppling Arafat Jan nd From The Economist Global Agenda Israels latest military actions in the West Bank have deepened the Palestinian conviction that Ariel Sharon Israels prime minister has decided to topple Yasser Arafat chairman of the Palestinian Authority and reoccupy all the areas it controls Many Israelis now share this analysis AP AP Going YASSER ARAFATS shrivelled dominion is under daily attack Early on January nd tanks entered the West Bank town of Nablus controlled by his Palestinian Authority PA Four Palestinians suspected militants from the Islamist group Hamas were killedin a gun battle according to Israel assassinated in cold blood in the Palestinian version of events At the same time the Israeli army was withdrawing from the centre of nearby Tulkarm which it had occupied the day before placing its residents under curfew arresting several people and engaging in sporadic shootouts with residents of a Palestinian refugee camp The invasion of Tulkarm was condemned by Terje RoedLarsen the UNs special coordinator for the Middle East peace process as a dangerous escalation Like the incursion into Nablus it was part of a series of Israeli reprisals for a Palestinian attack on a Bat Mitzvah reception in the town of Hadera on January th Six Israelis were killed and wounded in a suicide attack the first armed Palestinian operation inside Israel since Mr Arafat declared a ceasefire on December th On the afternoon of January nd an unidentified gunman opened fire on a rushhour crowd in central Jerusalem injuring at least people before being shot dead by police The alAqsa Brigadesa militia linked to Mr Arafats Fatah movementclaimed responsibility for both incidents calling them revenge for Israels unacknowledged assassination of Raed Karmi one of its leaders in Tulkarm on January th In response to the Hadera slaughter Israel used F jets to destroy the PAs main police station in Tulkarm on January th One Palestinian police officer was killed and people were wounded including civilians Then came the invasion Shortly after the deaths in Nablus Hamas too said it would reconsider the pause in its own suicide attacks in Israel Popular support for Hamas was shown the same day in a thousandsstrong demonstration in Nablus which led to the release of one of its members the brother of one of the dead men from a PA jail So it looks as if Israel and the Palestinians are back to the politics of the last atrocitythe endless cycle of murder and retribution that characterised the intifada in the preceasefire era But Palestinians say this time it is different Israel is now implementing its plan to topple President Arafat undermine the PA and reoccupy the PA areas says Marwan Barghouti the West Bank leader of Fatah Mr Barghouti himself could soon be a target Israel insists that he is the commander in charge of militias like the alAqsa Brigades His head will soon be on the same block as Mr Karmis predict Palestinians and several Israeli analysts but fewer and fewer of them would disagree with his prognosis On January th Israeli tanks moved to within spitting distance of Mr Arafats presidential offices in Ramallah They are digging in permanent positions suggesting the longest of stays The army also reconquered of the town Mr Arafats temporary capital and dynamited the PAs main radio station a symbolic act aimed at silencing Palestinian incitement Palestinians fought back first with stones and slingshots then with guns shooting randomly at nearby Jewish settlements and staging the occasional ambush on the tanks that now patrol Ramallahs streets Worse will almost certainly come Groups such as Hamas Islamic Jihad and radical factions of the Palestine Liberation Organisation are already vowing martyrdom in response to the invasions And Fatahaffiliated outfits like the alAqsa Brigades declared the ceasefire a hoax the moment Mr Karmi was killed Reuters Reuters The rubble in Tulkarm As for their leader Mr Arafat remains confined to his Ramallah headquarters literally under the barrels of Israeli guns He will neither flee nor resign insist his aides But all Palestinians are aware that if there is one more operation like Hadera Israel will be tempted to kick away the remaining stools on which their leader stands Palestinian fears about Mr Sharons intentions are increasingly converging with Israeli suspicions Both on the Israeli right and the left it is now widely assumed that the prime minister is determined to remove Mr Arafat from the picture The main difference between the two camps assessments is over whether Mr Sharon proposes to do away with the entire structure of the PA or rather to engineer a more palatable leadership to replace Mr Arafat Significantly this analysis of Mr Sharons intentions is provoking little outcry or even much sustained criticism within Israeli mainstream politics It is true that there was a good deal of embarrassed comment in the press over the armys largescale destruction of Palestinian homes at a refugee camp on the GazaEgypt border earlier this month Doveish voices also questioned the wisdom and timing of the assassination of Mr Karmi Even Dalia RabinPelossof the Labour Party deputy defence minister and daughter of Yitzhak Rabin an assassinated prime minister and peacemaker suggested on January st that the government of which she is a fairly central member may have missed an opportunity to move from violence to negotiations by failing to capitalise on the relative calm that prevailed between midDecember and early January But such criticism is not having big political repercussions On January th the Labour Partys central committee crushed a motion by Yossi Beilin a former minister and indefatigable peace negotiator to secede from the coalition government Speaker after speaker pointed out that to quit now would inevitably be seen as support for Mr Arafat and would be electoral suicide Green lights Reuters Reuters Tear gas for Israel Mr Barghouti the Fatah commander believes that in its plan to topple Mr Arafat Israel has received a green light from the Americans Mr Arafat has written to President George Bush asking him to send Anthony Zinni Americas Middle East envoy back to the region But the Americans say Mr Zinnis mediation efforts are presently on hold This silence worries Palestinians far more than Israeli tanks do On the Israeli side the idea that Bush has had it with Arafat has become axiomatic among aides to the prime minister These Israeli officials say the episode of the armssmuggling ship that Israel apprehended in the Red Sea three weeks ago convinced the Bush team of Mr Arafats perennial perfidy Israeli gloating over Washingtons purported or imminent dumping of Mr Arafat is probably unfounded or at any rate premature But Mr Sharon expectsand undisguisedly hopesthat the American administration will decide this week not to send Mr Zinni back to the region for the time being Briefing the leadership of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee the most important proIsraeli lobby in Washington the prime minister said the envoys return would only give the Palestinians hope that they can keep on shooting and also negotiate at the same time But if Mr Zinnis absence is indeed taken as American endorsement for a plan to oust Mr Arafat and the plan succeeds what then The forecast of Ahmed Abdul Rahman one of Mr Arafats aides may be biased but at the moment it is hard to argue with suicidal armed chaos
