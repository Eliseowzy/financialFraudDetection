last hour of trading stocks are back in the green and rising as traders seem to have shifted to a bargain hunting mode heading i nto the weekend in spite of some bad news which has dominated the session After yesterdays closing bell Gateway announced revised third quarter ex pectations that were far short of Wall Street estimates blaming a falloff in demand after the Sept th terrorist attack Combined with some downgr ades in various tech sectors that is sapping the enthusiasm we saw yesterd ay for tech stocks Reports of weak earnings and layoffs at Sun Microsyste ms from their conference call this morning are adding to the air of gloom a nd doom of todays session But foremost on traders minds today is the un employment rate announced at Eastern Time It held steady at ins tead of creeping up to as was expected but that number does not reflec t the full impact of nearly layoffs last month and analysts feel t he truth is much worse than the number indicates Nonetheless the indexes are rising and analysts speculate that this could be due to a growing con fidence among traders that the economy is in good hands and on the road to recovery MORE Breaking News IMAGE IMAGE
