mailtoJohn NRONcom Sent Friday September AM To Patti Scott Campbell Larry Schmidt Jon Cc Gadd Eric Hyatt Kevin Kilmer III Robert Cebryk Doug Subject Further Strategic Planning Environmental Jon Schmidt As one of the first steps in preparing for our early meeting with the FERC Staff I believe we need to take the State and Federal Agency list that Scott Patti has developed and select the key land managing agencies State US Forest Service BLM etc that will be impacted by the proposed right of way After the agencies are selected a meeting should be scheduled with those key agencies with the purpose of obtaining their commitment to participate in the early collaboration with the FERC on the Sun Devil Pipeline Project Your thoughtsWe should definitely meet with the federal land managing agencies as well as the Native Americans Better to meet with them individually at this point to assess their interest and willingness to work in an informal collaborative process and ID major issues with the route We should also meet with the COE FWS and major state agencies to assess the same information I also would like your input into the composition of the team that requests those meetings and participates I view the makeup of the team players for this task as very important to get this project offtheground with the right momentum Caveat I am thinking that you and I both should play a dual lead role in these early meetings with Larry Campbell andor Scott Patti setting them up for us your thoughts Then we can speak first hand to the FERC Staff about the commitment to collaborate Dont you believe we need to obtain their commitment prior to meeting with the FERC to discuss being considered for the expedited processingYes FERC requires knowing if the agencies will be willing to participate in this process As for team makeup Environmental Business Development and EngineeringDesign should attend these meetings to discuss FERC process and SunDevils envi approach to the project need for the project and routingdesign process that will be undertaken to make the project safe You and I dont both have to be at each meeting but since there will be multiple meetings we could staff dependent upon schedules and availability By the way as food for thought I have received a note from Doug Lake NRG and he stands ready to do the Third Party contractor work on the EIS if we can get the FERC to agree to let NRG do it without bidding the job out In fact since NRG has completed their work on the Kern River loop project Doug said that he has a team that could be placed on this project about the time we will need them That may work out good for everyone since the NRG team is familiar with the expedited process located in the western United States and familiar with the agencies and contacts in the area of our project NRG would have to convince not only FERC but Enron they have the resources to complete the work in your aggressive schedule This is fairly critical as you want a consultant who can keep up in this process and not put a lot of road blocks up On Gulfstream NRGs monitors representing FERC are bringing up issues and trying to make issues with things that the FERC PM doesnt even think is worth doingso we dont want someone doing things that is right in their own eyes and not looking out for Enrons best interests John Shafer Original Message From

primarily with most of the state and Federal level agencies that exist in both AZ and NM as well as the Navajo agencies I could get you a complete list of agencies weve contacted if youd like but almost every agency that would or could issue a permit in both states has been contacted Scott J Patti Senior Project Manager ENSR International Prospect Parkway Fort Collins CO Phone Fax Email

Scott Please furnish a list of who you will be talking with Caveat Scott you certainly realize that you must provide the FERC with summary notes of meetings with groups agencies etc when we make the FERC filing so keep good notes John Original Message From Hyatt Kevin Sent Thursday September PM To Shafer John Gadd Eric Cc NSRcom NSRcom Taylor Gina Cebryk Doug Subject RE Confidentiality of Sun Devil I spoke with Eric this afternoon Wed like a list of who ENSR is talking with We recognize the need to be as open as we can with stakeholders and consultees and concur with Johns comment below Were comfortable with Scott being able to show regulators a map of the preliminary route thanks kh Original Message From Shafer John Sent Wednesday September PM To Hyatt Kevin Gadd Eric Cc NSRcom NSRcom Taylor Gina Cebryk Doug Subject FW Confidentiality of Sun Devil Kevin and Eric Please read Scotts question below I have no problem with being a little more open with the regulators I would not publish anything in the paper as yet showing a route etc etc as that will only get the landowners stirred up before we are ready What are your thoughts Are you comfortable with Scott being able to show the regulators a map of a preliminary route John Original Message From Patti Scott mailto Sent Wednesday September PM To Cebryk Doug Shafer John Campbell Larry Cc Kendrick William Hyatt Kevin Schmidt Jon Alstad Jon Wade Alisa Subject Confidentiality of Sun Devil In discussions with several agency personnel it appears as though they are somewhat aware of Sun Devil Is it still to be treated as confidential or can we discuss it more freely The main benefit I see if we can discuss it more freely is that many of the regulators have said things like I would need to see a route to be able to answer your question better Let me know Thanks Scott Scott J Patti Senior Project Manager ENSR International Prospect Parkway Fort Collins CO Phone Fax Email The information contained in this
