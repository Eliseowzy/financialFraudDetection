BRUCE Subject Tennessee Energy Policy Work Group meeting September th Barbara This mornings meeting of the Reliability Availability Quality Price and Environmental Effects Committee of the Governors Energy Policy Work Group was primarily an opportunity for TVA to present their position in the current energy climate TVA had at least six representatives at the meeting Four of the TVA representatives gave presentations on the issues being considered by this committee These are the main points TVA emphasized Transmission capacity is a limited resource and TVA is near the limits of its capacity to handle further capacity TVA is very concerned about the implications of the open access rules being discussed as part of the national energy policy TVAs customers should be concerned about how changes in the energy industry will affect them TVAs presentation was loosely structured around the following questions posed by the committee prior to todays meeting How reliable is TVAs power How much available power does TVA have What is the quality of TVAs power resources What are the forecasts for energy costs What environmental concerns are involved with the location of energy facilities As you can see the questions are very broad and were essentially a vehicle to allow TVA to crow about its abilities as an electric generatorsupplier and to give subtle warnings about the dire consequences that would accompany the proliferation of private energy plants January RFP TVA was asked whether the interest in Tennessee for merchant power plants was directly related to the RFP issued by TVA in January This RFP is for MW to be sold to TVA beginning in TVA responded that it was possible that only one plant would be used to provide the MW and that the dozens of plants being planned in Tennessee would not be selling electricity to TVA This led to comments from the committee that most of these plants would not materialize once TVA awarded the RFP Incidentally TVA stated that proposals had been received in response to the RFP and the companies still on the short list of contenders for the RFP have been notified although TVA did not disclose the names of the shortlisted companies TVA added that the company chosen from the RFP would not be required to have the plant fully permitted at the time of the award Water supply TVA was asked if they had studied the impact that these facilities would have on Tennessees water supply TVA said they had not studied this situation editorial comment TVA has been the chief public critic of the disastrous amount of water these plants would use TVA did say they had years of records which they could use to project water flows Air quality considerations TVA spent a great deal of time discussing NOx emissions and admitted that they were responsible for of NOx emissions in Tennessee TVA claimed to be going forward with plans to reduce NOx emissions as required by an EPA order issued in They said their emissions would be down to tons of NOx in compared to the tons emitted in They did not mention that they are trying to get negotiate with the EPA for a more favorable level of NOx reductions TVA warned that the state should look closely and carefully consider the permitting of any new NOx sources because of the NOx reduction requirements being imposed by the EPA Transmission issues TVA has MW of transmission capacity TVA said use of their transmission capacity has skyrocketed in the last years There were transmission transactions on TVAs system in There were transmissions in TVA said they are working hard to protect their current policy requiring power plant owners to absorb the cost of upgrades and connections required when nonTVA power generators use TVAs transmission system They acknowledged that the Bush administration energy policy is moving toward a requirement that the cost be societized ie absorbed by ratepayers TVA identified the following as threats Adding generators to the their grid without adequate infrastructure Treating their system as an open market before tools to manage the system are available TVA said its transmission grid is reaching its limits and it would take a tremendous amount of time and money to build new infrastructure to handle the number of private plants now considering locating in Tennessee When asked about plans for this infrastructure TVA indicated they had done preliminary planning for potential infrastructure upgrades TVA said there are over pending requests for interconnection with TVAs transmission system Protection of Tennessee electric consumers TVA said its guidelines for electricity distribution are based on standard practices to protect TVAs native base customers They said proposed FERC rules would provide protection for other users of the transmission grid and lessen the protection for TVA customers Conclusion Future meetings At the end of the meeting Environment and Conservation Commissioner Milton Hamilton who cochairs this committee said his department needs expertise on the cutting edge environmental and production technology that is available for energy plants TVA said their Public Policy Institute that would be glad to assist the state with technology issues It was not clear whether Commissioner Hamilton accepted this offer or would seek out other disinterested parties for help Economic and Community Development Deputy Commissioner Tony Grande the committees other cochair said the committee may schedule another meeting after the September th public comment meeting to hear from the merchant power companies in a setting similar to the setting of todays meeting Gif Thornton and I would like to talk to you at your convenience on Thursday or Friday to discuss whether it would be in
