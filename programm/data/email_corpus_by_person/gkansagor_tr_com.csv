taken the TRAs Jan decision to the appeals court Walker who estimated that pay phone owners now pay per month for use of LEC lines said the figure was not cost based The TRAs Dec order which reduced the fee to per month used BellSouths own cost studies in establishing a costbased fee he added Finally we have a rate thats based on the cost of providing service Walker said If the appeals court upholds the TRAs rejection of the BellSouth petition the reduced pay phone line fee will go into effect Feb days after the original TRA order Passage of the line reduction also would force LECs to

call notification policy The Department of Public Utility Control has released an initial draft of an order that would require WorldCom Inc to provide advance notice before the company imposes a collect call block on a customers number The DPUC launched an investigation into WorldComs blocking procedures in March after receiving complaints that the company had prevented the completion of collect calls from prison facilities pm Families of inmates complained that WorldCom didnt notify them that collect calls would be blocked even though collect call charges were always paid in full Under the companys current tariffs WorldCom can block collect calls from correctional facilities without notice WorldCom places collect call blocks to prevent high toll fraud situations The company identifies end users with unusually high numbers of collect calls and then assesses the end users payment history and whether the end user has verified that the calls are legitimate The department determined that WorldComs procedures are reasonable but found that placing collect call blocks constitutes a form of termination of service The department concluded that WorldCom must revise its notification procedure to ensure that every end user subject to the imposition of collect call blocks on intrastate services shall be provided advance notification The department said it will consider

into alleged marketing abuses by GTE California Inc now Verizon California Inc As a part of the settlement Verizon paid million into the fund The fund is designed to educate nonEnglishspeaking telephone consumers in Verizons service territory about their rights as consumers to advocate safeguards of their rights Lynchs question arises from a recent opinion issued by Lockyer concluding that a settlement entered into by the former insurance commissioner establishing a private charitable foundation was illegal In his decision Lockyer said The insurance commissioner may not include a term of settlement requiring payment of funds to a private charitable foundation for the purpose of supporting activities unrelated to the regulatory enforcement responsibilities of the Department of Insurance in the proceeding Lynch said that although there may be legal and factual differences between the funds she was sufficiently concerned about the decision Lockyer based his opinion in the Department of Insurance case on a case that concluded that agencies could enter into settlements that further their purposes if those settlements dont contravene public policy Lynch said it wasnt

rejects cable TV late fee refunds The Indiana Court of Appeals has determined that Time Warner Entertainment Co LPs cable TV customers arent entitled to refunds of late fees they paid but later challenged as excessive But the court remanded to the Marion Superior Court the issue of whether Time Warner needs the late fees to cover its costs In several Time Warner subscribers filed a lawsuit against the company claiming that its late fee was excessive unreasonable and a penalty The plaintiffs sought recovery of the fees they had paid and injunctive relief to prohibit the company from continuing to charge the allegedly excessive fees Time Warner cited a study in which it had determined that the delinquent customers caused the company to incur costs of million amounting to a net monthly cost per delinquency The company therefore argued that the fee doesnt even cover its costs On July the Marion Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs claims for monetary damages But in August the court granted the plaintiffs motion to correct errors and directed late fee refunds Time Warner took that decision to the state appeals court Time Warner argued that the voluntary payment doctrine bars the plaintiffs from receiving any monetary damages Citing a case the appeals court noted that the general rule is a voluntary payment made under a mistake or in ignorance of law but with a full knowledge of all the facts and not induced by any fraud or improper conduct on the part of the payee cannot be recovered back City of Evansville v Walker Ind App NEd The appeals court found that the potential loss of cable TV service or the threat of litigation doesnt constitute the type of compulsion necessary to render the late fee payments involuntary Review of the plaintiffs complaints does not reveal the possibility of any other compulsion The appeals court said the Marion Superior Court is the appropriate venue for determining whether Time Warners late fee is costjustified This approach both allows the trial court to perform its gatekeeping function at the summary judgment stage of the proceedings and avoids placing an onerous burden upon the nonmoving party the court said

in operating areas service by Qwest Corp and Verizon Northwest Inc The commission also determined that Verizon may recover up to million and Qwest may recover up to million of their operation support system OSS transition costs In addition the commission addressed several collocation elements in its order which was issued yesterday This decision addresses Part A of a second generic proceeding to determine costs and prices for network elements During the first generic proceeding the commission set the costs and prices for unbundled network elements UNEs including the unbundled loop The first proceeding which was split into three phases set costs and established deaveraged prices for interconnection and UNEs The second proceeding addresses network elements not included in the first proceeding The WUTC rejected the proposal espoused by many of the competitive local exchange carriers CLECs for an exemption from making any contribution to the recurring costs of the loop Instead the WUTC set a flat fee for line sharing The commission also said it was premature to determine whether a nonzero price for the high frequency spectrum UNE would lead to overearning for Qwest or Verizon When the commission examined cost recovery issues related to the modifications Qwest and Verizon made to their OSSs to support a competitive environment it determined that Verizons proposed rates were just and reasonable Verizons nonrecurring charge for OSS transition cost recovery is per local service request and its nonrecurring charge for OSS transaction costs recovery is per local service request The WUTC rejected Qwests proposed OSS transition recovery costs and ordered the company to charge OSS transition and transaction rates equal to Verizons approved rates The commission noted that Qwests proposed costs were too highmore than twice the level reported by Verizonbecause the company doesnt perform its own OSS modifications Qwest relies on Telcordia Technologies Inc The commission allowed Verizon to collect a maximum of million and allowed Qwest to collect a maximum of million for OSS transition costs Multiplying Verizons proposed collection derived the value assigned to Qwests OSS recovery by the approximate ratio of Qwests access to Verizons access lines within the state The commission also took up a variety of collocation issues Verizon doesnt have to continue offering its Verizonowned splitter option beyond Dec on lines not currently using the companys splitters The commission found Qwests assumption that the average cable length is feet to be reasonable It approved Verizons estimates for planning and engineering time Other collocation issues addressed in the order include Verizons costs for cage enclosure and building modification

tells WorldCom to change collect call notification policy The Department of Public Utility Control has ordered WorldCom Inc to provide advance notice before imposing a collect call blocks on customers telephone numbers The DPUCs decision adopts a draft order released last month pm In March the DPUC launched an investigation into WorldComs blocking procedures in response to complaints that the company had prevented the completion of collect calls from prison facilities Families of inmates said WorldCom didnt notify them that collect calls would be blocked even though they always paid their collect call charges Under the companys current tariffs WorldCom can block collect calls from correctional facilities without notice WorldCom places collect call blocks to prevent hightoll fraud situations The company identifies end users with unusually high numbers of collect calls It then assesses the end users payment history and whether the end user has verified that the calls are legitimate If WorldCom is unable to verify the legitimacy of the calls it places a block on the end users line The department determined that WorldComs procedures are reasonable for most customers but concluded that the company needs to make more of an effort to notify a small segment of the end user population that is being maligned by the companys procedures The department however removed language from last months draft that said the imposition of a collect call block constituted a form of termination of service The department instead simply ordered WorldCom to revise its notification

hold technical conference on number conservation WASHINGTON WUTC sets workshop on customer notice rules FLORIDA New area code to take effect soon NEW YORK Time Warner Cable brings VoIP test to Rochester SECTION WASHINGTON WUTC sets line sharing OSS transition collocation prices The Utilities and Transportation Commission has set a flat fee for use of the highfrequency portion of the loops in operating areas service by Qwest Corp and Verizon Northwest Inc The commission also determined that Verizon may recover up to million and Qwest may recover up to million of their operation support system OSS transition costs In addition the commission addressed several collocation elements in its order which was issued yesterday This decision addresses Part A of a second generic proceeding to determine costs and prices for network elements During the first generic proceeding the commission set the costs and prices for unbundled network elements UNEs including the unbundled loop The first proceeding which was split into three phases set costs and established deaveraged prices for interconnection and UNEs The second proceeding addresses network elements not included in the first proceeding The WUTC rejected the proposal espoused by many of the competitive local exchange carriers CLECs for an exemption from making any contribution to the recurring costs of the loop Instead the WUTC set a flat fee for line sharing The commission also said it was premature to determine whether a nonzero price for the high frequency spectrum UNE would lead to overearning for Qwest or Verizon When the commission examined cost recovery issues related to the modifications Qwest and Verizon made to their OSSs to support a competitive environment it determined that Verizons proposed rates were just and reasonable Verizons nonrecurring charge for OSS transition cost recovery is per local service request and its nonrecurring charge for OSS transaction costs recovery is per local service request The WUTC rejected Qwests proposed OSS transition recovery costs and ordered the company to charge OSS transition and transaction rates equal to Verizons approved rates The commission noted that Qwests proposed costs were too highmore than twice the level reported by Verizonbecause the company doesnt perform its own OSS modifications Qwest relies on Telcordia Technologies Inc The commission allowed Verizon to collect a maximum of million and allowed Qwest to collect a maximum of million for OSS transition costs Multiplying Verizons proposed collection derived the value assigned to Qwests OSS recovery by the approximate ratio of Qwests access to Verizons access lines within the state The commission also took up a variety of collocation issues Verizon doesnt have to continue offering its Verizonowned splitter option beyond Dec on lines not currently using the companys splitters The commission found Qwests assumption that the average cable length is feet to be reasonable It approved Verizons estimates for planning and engineering time Other collocation issues addressed in the order include Verizons costs for cage enclosure and building modification efficient splitter configuration Verizons jumper costs and Verizons environmental conditioning Hearings for Part B of this proceeding are scheduled to begin March The order is available at

tells WorldCom to change collect call notification policy The Department of Public Utility Control has ordered WorldCom Inc to provide advance notice before imposing a collect call blocks on customers telephone numbers The DPUCs decision adopts a draft order released last month pm In March the DPUC launched an investigation into WorldComs blocking procedures in response to complaints that the company had prevented the completion of collect calls from prison facilities Families of inmates said WorldCom didnt notify them that collect calls would be blocked even though they always paid their collect call charges Under the companys current tariffs WorldCom can block collect calls from correctional facilities without notice WorldCom places collect call blocks to prevent hightoll fraud situations The company identifies end users with unusually high numbers of collect calls It then assesses the end users payment history and whether the end user has verified that the calls are legitimate If WorldCom is unable to verify the legitimacy of the calls it places a block on the end users line The department determined that WorldComs procedures are reasonable for most customers but concluded that the company needs to make more of an effort to notify a small segment of the end user population that is being maligned by the companys procedures The department however removed language from last months draft that said the imposition of a collect call block constituted a form of termination of service The department instead simply ordered WorldCom to revise its notification procedure to ensure that every end user subject to the imposition of collect call blocks on intrastate services shall be provided advance notification If WorldCom cant reach a customer by phone and cant provide written notice by overnight mail it must use a live agent to find the person WorldCom can initiate a collect call block without actual notice only after trying the options for three days

rejects cable TV late fee refunds The Indiana Court of Appeals has determined that Time Warner Entertainment Co LPs cable TV customers arent entitled to refunds of late fees they paid but later challenged as excessive But the court remanded to the Marion Superior Court the issue of whether Time Warner needs the late fees to cover its costs In several Time Warner subscribers filed a lawsuit against the company claiming that its late fee was excessive unreasonable and a penalty The plaintiffs sought recovery of the fees they had paid and injunctive relief to prohibit the company from continuing to charge the allegedly excessive fees Time Warner cited a study in which it had determined that the delinquent customers caused the company to incur costs of million amounting to a net monthly cost per delinquency The company therefore argued that the fee doesnt even cover its costs On July the Marion Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs claims for monetary damages But in August the court granted the plaintiffs motion to correct errors and directed late fee refunds Time Warner took that decision to the state appeals court Time Warner argued that the voluntary payment doctrine bars the plaintiffs from receiving any monetary damages Citing a case the appeals court noted that the general rule is a voluntary payment made under a mistake or in ignorance of law but with a full knowledge of all the facts and not induced by any fraud or improper conduct on the part of the payee cannot be recovered back City of Evansville v Walker Ind App NEd The appeals court found that the potential loss of cable TV service or the threat of litigation doesnt constitute the type of compulsion necessary to render the late fee payments involuntary Review of the plaintiffs complaints does not reveal the possibility of any other compulsion The appeals court said the Marion Superior Court is the appropriate venue for determining whether Time Warners late fee is costjustified This
