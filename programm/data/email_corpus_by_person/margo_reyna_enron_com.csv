CALIFORNIA PUC to mull advice letter procedures A Public Utilities Commission administrative law judge has asked interested parties to comment on whether a hearing should be held to discuss various proposals to change the advice letter process Regulated companies usually file advice letters to make routine tariff changes According to the ALJ a consequence of the proliferation of the telecom industry is that the PUCs procedures for different types of telecommunications advice letters also have proliferated rapidly sometimes even on a utilityspecific basis He said the goal of this proceeding was to unify and simplify existing procedures which are scattered over many decisions and resolutions The ALJ said some parties have asked the commission to retain certain advice letter procedures but they disagreed about which ones should be kept The ALJ has asked interested parties to respond by June to his questions about advice letter procedures that are inconsistent with the commissions general or telecom rules Commenting parties also must discuss whether and why they think a hearing would be warranted Rulemaking no Rulemaking for purposes of revising General Order A

CUB was responding to a recommendation by two hearing examiners against including any revenue reduction when renewing the companys alternative regulation plan A review of Ameritechs finances conducted by CUB and other consumer agencies found that the company has underreported its revenues and overstated its expenses to mask its true earnings and ward off any rate reduction When the companys books are adjusted for those discrepencies CUB said the study shows rates should be reduced by million a decrease that would save the typical customer a year CUB Executive Director Martin Cohen said The

CUB was responding to a recommendation by two hearing examiners against including any revenue reduction when renewing the companys alternative regulation plan A review of Ameritechs finances conducted

CALIFORNIA PUC to mull advice letter procedures A Public Utilities Commission administrative law judge has asked interested parties to comment on whether a hearing should be held to discuss various proposals to change the advice letter process Regulated companies usually file advice letters to make routine tariff changes According to the ALJ a consequence of the proliferation of the telecom industry is that the PUCs procedures for different types of telecommunications advice letters also have proliferated rapidly sometimes even on a utilityspecific basis He said the goal of this proceeding was to unify and simplify existing procedures which are scattered over many decisions and resolutions The ALJ said some parties have asked the commission to retain certain advice letter procedures but they disagreed about which ones should be kept The ALJ has asked interested parties to respond by June to his questions about advice letter procedures that are inconsistent with the commissions general or telecom rules Commenting parties also must discuss whether and why they think a hearing would be warranted Rulemaking no Rulemaking for purposes of revising General Order A regarding informal filings at the Commission ALABAMA Rule would revise reporting requirements The Public Service Commission has asked for comments by June on a proposed rule that would require long distance carriers to identify for informational purposes their interstate long distance perminute rates in their tariffs The proposed rule also would require carriers to identify the product name per minute rates minimum monthly charges and billing increments applicable to intrastate long distance calling plans within the same section under which the service is described in the tariff The new rule

be found in the same general area of the tariff as the rate schedule the PSC said Docket no NEBRASKA Gov Johanns mulls fiberoptics bill The Legislature has passed and sent to Gov Mike Johanns R

alternatives ILLINOIS CUB urges commission to order Ameritech rate cut The Citizens Utility Board yesterday renewed its call for the Commerce Commission to reduce AmeritechIllinois rates by million CUB was responding to a recommendation by two hearing examiners against including any revenue reduction when renewing the companys alternative regulation plan A review of Ameritechs finances conducted by CUB and other consumer agencies found that the company has underreported its revenues and overstated its expenses to mask its true earnings and ward off any rate reduction When the companys books are adjusted for those discrepencies CUB said the study shows rates should be reduced by million a decrease that would save the typical customer a year CUB Executive Director Martin Cohen said The hearing examines ignored all the evidence showing that Ameritechs rates are excessive But weve seen the ICC overrule their hearing examiners on many occasions We look forward to arguing our case

incorrect in asserting that the FCC only included two subloop elements as UNEs in fact the FCC requires all subloop elements to be unbundled The problem the PSC said is that there isnt a list of subloop elements Although ATT argued that the loop concentrator qualifies ATT didnt define the term or explain its function the PSC said Once parties provide a list defining each subloop element and explaining their functions the PSC will set a final list of elements Verizon will have to provide costs for those elements in its UNE cost studies Order no Formal case no In the Matter of the

POLICY Public Broadcasting Report c Copyright Warren Communications News Inc All Rights Reserved Cable operators programming networks broadcasters DBS providers consumer electronics interests Bell companies ISPs sports leagues software developers electronic program guide creators personal video recording firms and consumer groups all battled over possible interactive TV ITV regulations at FCC In comments filed in response to Commissions ITV inquiry entities debated whether federal govt should regulate nascent interactive market in wake of AOLs takeover of Time Warner TW earlier this year They also feuded over how govt should define interactive services if it chose to regulate them Pushing for technologically neutral nondiscrimination safeguards on such vertically integrated MSOs as AOL TW group of major programmers urged FCC to mandate that all broadband distributors carrying any ITV signals forward signals for all programmers on their cable systems Group consisting of Disney Univision USA Networks and ViacomCBS also called on Commission to ban discriminatory routing or caching practices that would permit cable operators to send their affiliated programming at faster speeds than rival networks Programmers contended that consumers shouldnt have to buy additional settop box to receive unaffiliated ITV services It is far easier and requires far less intrusive government regulation to prevent monopoly power from distorting a relatively new market than it is to combat monopoly power already unleashed in a more developed market group said Public interest groups ALTV APTS BellSouth EarthLink GemstarTV Guide International MSTV NAB PBS PBR March p and SBC Communications all made similar arguments in favor of FCCs adopting ITV rules For instance joint filing by Media Access Project Consumers Union Consumer Federation of America and Center for Media Education called on Commission to move expeditiously to begin a rulemaking establishing open access for providers of enhancements on all platforms whether cable DBS DTV or new technologies yet unknown They contended that agencys failure to act would allow cable MSOs to become the gatekeepers of what has thus far been a gateless online community and devastate independent content providers Without safeguards they said ITV is likely to become a digital mirror image of the current closed multichannel cable model Regulatory opponents countered that imposing ITV restrictions on cable systems would discourage them from starting new services hampering development of emerging industry Opponents including AOL TW ATT Cablevision Systems Charter Canal Plus Technologies Comcast NCTA NFL OpenTV ProgressFreedom Foundation and group of programmers declared it was too early to impose obligations on ITV providers They said early regulation would be unworkable creating administrative nightmare Calling even the threat of regulation of ITV market a major mistake NCTA for example argued that there is simply no basis for assuming a problem and proposing regulatory solutions Saying FCC deliberately had refrained from imposing similar rules on cable highspeed data services which are much further along in development NCTA said Commission should refrain from regulating ITV services for same reason It also warned that agency had very limited authority to regulate ITV services under Communications Act and easily could violate First Amendment rights of cable operators if it tried to do so Calling inquiry a peculiar and misguided proceeding NCTA said First Amendment would seem to preclude the very regulations suggested by the notice which would interfere with cable operators constitutionally protected editorial judgments Taking different tacks DBS providers EchoStar and DirecTV said in separate filings that they wanted FCC to keep close tabs on cable operators so they wouldnt use their market power to keep interactive TV services from other multichannel operators including satellite TV companies DBS companies said they were concerned that cable companies might have unfair advantage in marketplace if both industries were regulated in same way by Commission DirecTV said it was premature for agency to fully regulate ITV services but it favored continued monitoring by the FCC of the potential for anticompetitive behavior by cable operators Regulatory intervention at this nascent stage of ITV development makes little sense DirecTV said There are as yet no dominant providers of ITV services and the marketplace is still in the process of sorting out the technological standards that it will follow during future delivery EchoStar said there was absolutely no basis for imposing ITV carriage obligations on distributors lacking market power in any relevant market such as itself Such action would penalize new entrants and favor incumbent cable operators filing said FCCCAPITOL HILL In action that will significantly limit number of lowpower FM LPFM stations to be licensed FCC released decision April saying LPFM stations must meet same rd adjacent channel interference protection requirement as fullpower stations Order implements requirements of rider on FCC appropriations bill signed into law in Dec Commission expects to complete action on its LPFM licensing window in few months it said in order and then will direct Mass Media Bureau to open window to allow LPFM applicants that didnt meet rd channel requirements to try to come into compliance FCC Chmn Powell said action allowed Commission to begin granting construction permits for at least some LPFM stations and agency had begun independent testing to determine impact of LPFM stations on fullpower FM stations and translators As part of order FCC also implemented congressional mandate that denies LPFM license to former pirate radio operators FCC Comr FurchtgottRoth issued separate statement saying he supported move to implement congressional mandate but believed FCC should have delayed LPFM licensing while it went through rulemaking process in order to comply with Administrative Procedure Act Sen Cochran RMiss introduced S to reauthorize PTVs Ready to Learn and Ready to Teach programs Bill also would graduate Mathline a component of programs providing professional development models for teachers of mathematics to TeacherLine more comprehensive professional development tool for K teachers Citing research by U of Ala and U of Kan Cochran said Ready to Learn was having positive impact on children and their parents Studies showed that Ready to Learn families read books together more often and for longer periods than nonparticipants Surprisingly studies said Ready to Learn children watched less TV and were more likely to choose educational programs when they did watch he said Advent of digital broadcasting which allows broadcast of multiple video channels and data simultaneously will make it possible for instructional materials to be distributed on fulltime continuous channels when teachers and students need it Cochran said FCC regulatory fees would increase average of for FY agency said in proposed rulemaking released March Fees generally followed previous years practice of acrossboard increase to meet congressional mandate for FCC to recoup larger portion of its operating budget through regulatory fees Congress required Commission to collect million in regulatory fees this year up million from FY In early years FCC attempted to base regulatory fees on actual cost of regulation but it generally has used acrossboard increases since FY It said it hoped to have new cost accounting system in place in time for setting fees for FY Comments on fees are due April replies May MD Heads of national public broadcasting organizations and many local PTV station managers expressed appreciation at April gathering in Washington to Public Broadcasting Caucus in House which now has members Saying public broadcasting always had enjoyed strong support in Congress CPB Pres Robert Coonrod said new group would be asset in furthering that support for our mission of providing valuable education services to the American people NPR Pres Kevin Klose said he hoped caucus would serve as effective forum for discussion of complex policy issues facing public radio Pres Pat Mitchell said PBS looks forward to working with the caucus to strengthen the unique and important role that public television plays in providing nonviolent and educational programs and services to Americas children and their families New APTS Pres John Lawson said caucus came at critical time when PTV stations were bracing for transition to DTV If FCC reallocates any part of Instructional TV Fixed Service ITFS spectrum or G mobile device service the capacity usefulness and value of ITFS would be significantly reduced Miss Humanities Council said in ex parte filing on notice of proposed rulemaking on G spectrum allocations Even if only part of spectrum is taken away many educational institutions would either lose their ITFS service altogether or face new equipment costs service disruption cutbacks lower quality of service and signal interference council said In either scenario the ITFS community would be incapable of supporting advanced wireless services and promoting the development of broadband services to the educational community and to underserved communities nationwide it said FCC Chmn Powell called on Congress to bolster agencys enforcement powers measure he said was necessary to protect consumers as Commission executed streamlined business plan thats aligned with the realities of a dynamic and converging marketplace He also told House Telecom Subcommittee at hearing March that legislative approval was necessary to carry out his bureau restructuring plan which still was being formulated and his policy vision of making FCC more efficient effective and responsive Powell said FCC if given sufficient enforcement capabilities would guarantee fairness to all and allegiance to none but warned potential regulatory violators that Commission likewise would levy severe penalties If you cheat Im going to hurt you and hurt you hard he said Ability to impose heavier fines and having fewer time constraints to carry out enforcement action via changes in statute of limitations are tools Congress could give FCC Powell said If Commission can fine a company only when companies earn millions or even billions of dollars annually then they will view fines just as the cost of business and have less incentive to comply he said Commerce Committee Chmn Tauzin RLa said Powell spent years as commissioner watching how not to run the FCC and expressed confidence that under his leadership it would become an agency that fosters innovation and investment rather than one that inhibits the deployment of new services He told Powell he would work with him to rationalize the structure of agency so services rather than service providers are subject to regulatory or deregulatory framework Communications lawyers on Washington Legal Foundation panel on FCC and Communications Policy split on whether major revamp of FCC was needed immediately Its hard to disagree about the need to overhaul the FCC said attorney Nick Allard of LathamWatkins Moderator and former FCC Chmn Richard Wiley did disagree sharply with Allard who called for abolishing of commission seats and actively involving Commerce Dept and NTIA in regulation of various communications industries What FCC needs countered Wiley is more delegation of authority to staff and more rapid decisions something that can be accomplished with present structure and Chmn Powell can get it done Because of congressional respect for Powell any agency reform is going to come first from the FCC itself rather than from Hill Wiley predicted Panelist Charles Kennedy of MorrisonFoerster generally agreed with Allard while David Poe of LeBoeuf Lamb GreeneMacRae partly sided with Wiley Commission doesnt need revamping for short term Poe said but major overhaul may be necessary in long term Kennedy said FCC operations were outmoded We are going to have to make some fundamental changes if things dont turn around Allard listed questions that must be answered on FCCs future including whether competition was prerequisite for deregulation or was it other way around and did Commissions current organizational structure make sense Poe said Powell had shown hes not afraid to grapple with tough issues and that there were many ambiguities and contradictions in Telecom Act Statutory reform of FCC is needed he said but it will be very hard to get Congress to pass legislation on issue On digital TV Poe said FCC had tried to push broadcasters into new technology but you cant make a market if the market isnt there FCC set deadlines March for comment on its proposed rulemaking on DTV mustcarry issue following publication of notice in Federal Register Commission tentatively concluded in Jan against imposing dualcarriage obligations on cable operators during current digital broadcasting transition but left issue open for final determination

POLICY Public Broadcasting Report c Copyright Warren Communications News Inc All Rights Reserved Cable operators programming networks broadcasters DBS providers consumer electronics interests Bell companies ISPs sports leagues software developers electronic program guide creators personal video recording firms and consumer groups all battled over possible interactive TV ITV regulations at FCC In comments filed in response to Commissions ITV inquiry entities debated whether federal govt should regulate nascent interactive market in wake of AOLs takeover of Time Warner TW earlier this year They also feuded over how govt should define interactive services if it chose to regulate them Pushing for technologically neutral nondiscrimination safeguards on such vertically integrated MSOs as AOL TW group of major programmers urged FCC to mandate that all broadband distributors carrying any ITV signals forward signals for all programmers on their cable systems Group consisting of Disney Univision USA Networks and ViacomCBS also called on Commission to ban discriminatory routing or caching practices that would permit cable operators to send their affiliated programming at faster speeds than rival networks Programmers contended that consumers shouldnt have to buy additional settop box to receive unaffiliated ITV services It is far easier and requires far less intrusive government regulation to prevent monopoly power from distorting a relatively new market than it is to combat monopoly power already unleashed in a more developed market group said Public interest groups ALTV APTS BellSouth EarthLink GemstarTV Guide International MSTV NAB PBS PBR March p and SBC Communications all made similar arguments in favor of FCCs adopting ITV rules For instance joint filing by Media Access Project Consumers Union Consumer Federation of America and Center for Media Education called on Commission to move expeditiously to begin a rulemaking establishing open access for providers of enhancements on all platforms whether cable DBS DTV or new technologies yet unknown They contended that agencys failure to act would allow cable MSOs to become the gatekeepers of what has thus far been a gateless online community and devastate independent content providers Without safeguards they said ITV is likely to become a digital mirror image of the current closed multichannel cable model Regulatory opponents countered that imposing ITV restrictions on cable systems would discourage them from starting new services hampering development of emerging industry Opponents including AOL TW ATT Cablevision Systems Charter Canal Plus Technologies Comcast NCTA NFL OpenTV ProgressFreedom Foundation and group of programmers declared it was too early to impose obligations on ITV providers They said early regulation would be unworkable creating administrative nightmare Calling even the threat of regulation of ITV market a major mistake NCTA for example argued that there is simply no basis for assuming a problem and proposing regulatory solutions Saying FCC deliberately had refrained from imposing similar rules on cable highspeed data services which are much further along in development NCTA said Commission should refrain from regulating ITV services for same reason It also warned that agency had very limited authority to regulate ITV services under Communications Act and easily could violate First Amendment rights of cable operators if it tried to do so Calling inquiry a peculiar and misguided proceeding NCTA said First Amendment would seem to preclude the very regulations suggested by the notice which would interfere with cable operators constitutionally protected editorial judgments Taking different tacks DBS providers EchoStar and DirecTV said in separate filings that they wanted FCC to keep close tabs on cable operators so they wouldnt use their market power to keep interactive TV services from other multichannel operators including satellite TV companies DBS companies said they were concerned that cable companies might have unfair advantage in marketplace if both industries were regulated in same way by Commission DirecTV said it was premature for agency to fully regulate ITV services but it favored continued monitoring by the FCC of the potential for anticompetitive behavior by cable operators Regulatory intervention at this nascent stage of ITV development makes little sense DirecTV said There are as yet no dominant providers of ITV services and the marketplace is still in the process of sorting out the technological standards that it will follow during future delivery EchoStar said there was absolutely no basis for imposing ITV carriage obligations on distributors lacking market power in any relevant market such as itself Such action would penalize new entrants and favor incumbent cable operators filing said FCCCAPITOL HILL In action that will significantly limit number of lowpower FM LPFM stations to be licensed FCC released decision April saying LPFM stations must meet same rd adjacent channel interference protection requirement as fullpower stations Order implements requirements of rider on FCC appropriations bill signed into law in Dec Commission expects to complete action on its LPFM licensing window in few months it said in order and then will direct Mass Media Bureau to open window to allow LPFM applicants that didnt meet rd channel requirements to try to come into compliance FCC Chmn Powell said action allowed Commission to begin granting construction permits for at least some LPFM stations and agency had begun independent testing to determine impact of LPFM stations on fullpower FM stations and translators As part of order FCC also implemented congressional mandate that denies LPFM license to former pirate radio operators FCC Comr FurchtgottRoth issued separate statement saying he supported move to implement congressional mandate but believed FCC should have delayed LPFM licensing while it went through rulemaking process in order to comply with Administrative Procedure Act Sen Cochran RMiss introduced S to reauthorize PTVs Ready to Learn and Ready to Teach programs Bill also would graduate Mathline a component of programs providing professional development models for teachers of mathematics to TeacherLine more comprehensive professional development tool for K teachers Citing research by U of Ala and U of Kan Cochran said Ready to Learn was having positive impact on children and their parents Studies showed that Ready to Learn families read books together more often and for longer periods than nonparticipants Surprisingly studies said Ready to Learn children watched less TV and were more likely to choose educational programs when they did watch he said Advent of digital broadcasting which allows broadcast of multiple video channels and data simultaneously will make it possible for instructional materials to be distributed on fulltime continuous channels when teachers and students need it Cochran said FCC regulatory fees would increase average of for FY agency said in proposed rulemaking released March Fees generally followed previous years practice of acrossboard increase to meet congressional mandate for FCC to recoup larger portion of its operating budget through regulatory fees Congress required Commission to collect million in regulatory fees this year up million from FY In early years FCC attempted to base regulatory fees on actual cost of regulation but it generally has used acrossboard increases since FY It said it hoped to have new cost accounting system in place in time for setting fees for FY Comments on fees are due April replies May MD Heads of national public broadcasting organizations and many local PTV station managers expressed appreciation at April gathering in Washington to Public Broadcasting Caucus in House which now has members Saying public broadcasting always had enjoyed strong support in Congress CPB Pres Robert Coonrod said new group would be asset in furthering that support for our mission of providing valuable education services to the American people NPR Pres Kevin Klose said he hoped caucus would serve as effective forum for discussion of complex policy issues facing public radio Pres Pat Mitchell said PBS looks forward to working with the caucus to strengthen the unique and important role that public television plays in providing nonviolent and educational programs and services to Americas children and their families New APTS Pres John Lawson said caucus came at critical time when PTV stations were bracing for transition to DTV If FCC reallocates any part of Instructional TV Fixed Service ITFS spectrum or G mobile device service the capacity usefulness and value of ITFS would be significantly reduced Miss Humanities Council said in ex parte filing on notice of proposed rulemaking on G spectrum allocations Even if only part of spectrum is taken away many educational institutions would either lose their ITFS service altogether or face new equipment costs service disruption cutbacks lower quality of service and signal interference council said In either scenario the ITFS community would be incapable of supporting advanced wireless services and promoting the development of broadband services to the educational community and to underserved communities nationwide it said FCC Chmn Powell called on Congress to bolster agencys enforcement powers measure he said was necessary to protect consumers as Commission executed streamlined business plan thats aligned with the realities of a dynamic and converging marketplace He also told House Telecom Subcommittee at hearing March that legislative approval was necessary to carry out his bureau restructuring plan which still was being formulated and his policy vision of making FCC more efficient effective and responsive Powell said FCC if given sufficient enforcement capabilities would guarantee fairness to all and allegiance to none but warned potential regulatory violators that Commission likewise would levy severe penalties If you cheat Im going to hurt you and hurt you hard he said Ability to impose heavier fines and having fewer time constraints to carry out enforcement action via changes in statute of limitations are tools Congress could give FCC Powell said If Commission can fine a company only when companies earn millions or even billions of dollars annually then they will view fines just as the cost of business and have less incentive to comply he said Commerce Committee Chmn Tauzin RLa said Powell spent years as commissioner watching how not to run the FCC and expressed confidence that under his leadership it would become an agency that fosters innovation and investment rather than one that inhibits the deployment of new services He told Powell he would work with him to rationalize the structure of agency so services rather than service providers are subject to regulatory or deregulatory framework Communications lawyers on Washington Legal Foundation panel on FCC and Communications Policy split on whether major revamp of FCC was needed immediately Its hard to disagree about the need to overhaul the FCC said attorney Nick Allard of LathamWatkins Moderator and former FCC Chmn Richard Wiley did disagree sharply with Allard who called for abolishing of commission seats and actively involving Commerce Dept and NTIA in regulation of various communications industries What FCC needs countered Wiley is more delegation of authority to staff and more rapid decisions something that can be accomplished with present structure and Chmn Powell can get it done Because of congressional respect for Powell any agency reform is going to come first from the FCC itself rather than from Hill Wiley predicted Panelist Charles Kennedy of MorrisonFoerster generally agreed with Allard while David Poe of LeBoeuf Lamb GreeneMacRae partly sided with Wiley Commission doesnt need revamping for short term Poe said but major overhaul may be necessary in long term Kennedy said FCC operations were outmoded We are going to have to make some fundamental changes if things dont turn around Allard listed questions that must be answered on FCCs future including whether competition was prerequisite for deregulation or was it other way around and did Commissions current organizational structure make sense Poe said Powell had shown hes not afraid to grapple with tough issues and that there were many ambiguities and contradictions in Telecom Act Statutory reform of FCC is needed he said but it will be very hard to get Congress to pass legislation on issue On digital TV Poe said FCC had tried to push broadcasters into new technology but you cant make a market if the market isnt there FCC set deadlines March for comment on its proposed rulemaking on DTV mustcarry issue following publication of notice in Federal Register Commission tentatively concluded in Jan against imposing dualcarriage obligations on cable operators during current digital broadcasting transition but left issue open for final determination
