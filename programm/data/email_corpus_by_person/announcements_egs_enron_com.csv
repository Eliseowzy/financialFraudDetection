<27868053.1075860944617.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,announcements.egs@enron.com,2002-02-12 13:30:00,Transcripts of Steve Coopers voicemailsOn January Enron named Stephen F Cooper interim CEO and chief restructuring officer To keep employees informed about developments Mr Cooper left voicemail messages to employees on January and February Since some employees do not have access to voicemail we are providing the following transcripts of those messages STEPHEN F COOPER VOICEMAIL Friday February Hi everybody This is Steve Cooper Its about or oclock Houston time Friday afternoon Its been a pretty hectic week but Id like to take just a moment to bring everybody up to date so that everybody is fully in the loop with whats gone on this last week Beginning last weekend the Boards special investigative committee released a fairly lengthy report in fact its about odd pages and its fairly pointed and blunt The report was troubling and as Im sure any number of you has seen from the various investigatory committees this week its findings have further dented our corporate history Nonetheless I just wanted to let you know that my role and the job Im paid to do and hopefully the job all of you are getting paid to do is to look forward and proceed that way at percent full speed I continue to believe we really have a lot to look forward to The committee and the report didnt offer any specific recommendations Rather it just compiled what they believed to be a series of facts about transactions that have been undertaken over the last several years Enrons board management and Creditors Committee are now working together to evaluate the reports findings and take whatever action is required I like many of you am looking forward to management changes that result from these actions because to successfully to restructure the company were going to have to have a management team in place that is credible thats committed to moving forward for the future that is trusted by our outside constituents and are firmly committed to make a new Enron work Next week after the Board meeting I hope to be able to share with you the management changes that are being contemplated and outline a team that Jeffrey and myself are compiling to rebuild the company The Washington hearings this week heated up considerably and made for some either very dull or very expected or pretty interesting television viewing And obviously this has been translated into the daily headlines Hopefully these investigatory processes will continue to help uncover and address any past misconduct or negligence surrounding Enron And with this Im sure well be able to establish appropriate safeguards for employees and shareholders going forward not only for Enron but for other corporations This situation I believe will have a national impact Its going to force the big five accounting firms to change the way they do business in fact it already has Its going to bring in new and more effective reporting rules Its going to put more teeth into the SEC ARISA is going to be modified Theres not a doubt in my mind that Congress or these Committees are eventually going to look at Wall Street and the commercial banks and put them in their sites During the last week Ive spent almost all my time dealing with the companys Creditors Committee and chatting with individual members of the committee to understand their current thinking concerns and issues so we can begin to construct with them an absolutely open agenda a free flow of information a free flow of communications and begin to work with them to develop a plan to reorganize Enron As I continue to look at our various businesses Im as optimistic as I was a week ago that there is a reorganizable platform here that ought to allow us if everybody is reasonable and responsible and we can begin to put some of our emotions aside to create a viable strong company that ought to be able to be successfully reorganized In any event Ill continue to keep you updated as we move forward In the meantime if you have any specific questions or comments about Enron or its restructuring or anything else thats on your mind dont hesitate to either send me an email or give me a buzz and I will do the best I can to respond as quickly as possible If my response isnt satisfactory the first time around just buzz me again Listen everyone have a wonderful weekend and I hope to see you next week in Houston Byebye STEPHEN F COOPER VOICEMAIL Tuesday January Good morning everyone this is Steve Cooper its the morning of January th and I wanted to take an opportunity to introduce myself and tell you how pleased I am to have been selected as Enrons interim CEO My firm Zolfo Cooper my partners and I have assisted hundreds of companies as they have worked their way through the restructuring and reorganization process I just wanted to give you some of my thoughts about it as we move forward I cant imagine what the past few months have been like for all of you Im sure its been incredibly difficult particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched In that environment Ive got to believe its difficult if not impossible for you to focus on what lies ahead for Enron and for the organization Im not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning however Id like to tell you how we typically approach situations like this Its been the experience of myself my firm my partners that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings Those metrics are typically the organization the asset base that the company has to bring to bear customer base and liquidity From what Ive been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here Enron has a very very bright very capable very committed hardworking and dedicated organization All of the people I have met are committed to reorganize restructure and bring Enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcy Number the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here The regulated assets the pipelines the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure around Third loyal customers Most of Enrons customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basis And fourth liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand the cash it expects to generate in the near term and with the backstop of the DIP financing it doesnt appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forward With those four resources nicely in place Im very confident that we can successfully restructure this company I dont want to leave the impression that it will be easy Its going to be an enormous amount of work There will be upsets issues and concerns along the way But I can tell you that Ive seen companies in bankruptcy that dont have nearly as strong a position as this company They were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy and Im certain Enron will also Im looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and Im very pleased to be here Jeff Ray and I will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward If there are any thoughts concerns issues that you would like to bring to my attention please dont hesitate to drop me a note or give me a call Thanks so much and I look forward to working with all of you

hectic week but Id like to take just a moment to bring everybody up to date so that everybody is fully in the loop with whats gone on this last week Beginning last weekend the Boards special investigative committee released a fairly lengthy report in fact its about odd pages and its fairly pointed and blunt The report was troubling and as Im sure any number of you has seen from the various investigatory committees this week its findings have further dented our corporate history Nonetheless I just wanted to let you know that my role and the job Im paid to do and hopefully the job all of you are getting paid to do is to look forward and proceed that way at percent full speed I continue to believe we really have a lot to look forward to The committee and the report didnt offer any specific recommendations Rather it just compiled what they believed to be a series of facts about transactions that have been undertaken over the last several years Enrons board management and Creditors Committee are now working together to evaluate the reports findings and take whatever action is required I like many of you am looking forward to management changes that result from these actions because to successfully to restructure the company were going to have to have a management team in place that is credible thats committed to moving forward for the future that is trusted by our outside constituents and are firmly committed to make a new Enron work Next week after the Board meeting I hope to be able to share with you the management changes that are being contemplated and outline a team that Jeffrey and myself are compiling to rebuild the company The Washington hearings this week heated up considerably and made for some either very dull or very expected or pretty

the commercial banks and put them in their sites During the last week Ive spent almost all my time dealing with the companys Creditors Committee and chatting with individual members of the committee to understand their current thinking concerns and issues so we can begin to construct with them an absolutely open agenda a free flow of information a free flow of communications and begin to work

restructuring officer To keep employees informed about developments Mr Cooper left voicemail messages to employees on January and February Since some employees do not have access to voicemail we are providing the following transcripts of those messages STEPHEN F COOPER VOICEMAIL Friday February Hi everybody This is Steve Cooper Its about or oclock Houston time Friday afternoon Its been a pretty hectic week but Id like to take just a moment to bring everybody up to date so that everybody is fully in the loop with whats gone on this last week Beginning last weekend the Boards special investigative committee released a fairly lengthy report in fact its about odd pages and its fairly pointed and blunt The report was troubling and as Im sure any number of you has seen from the various investigatory committees this week its findings have further dented our corporate history Nonetheless I just wanted to let you know that my role and the job Im paid to do and hopefully the job all of you are getting paid to do is to look forward and proceed that way at percent full speed I continue to believe we really have a lot to look forward to The committee and the report didnt offer any specific recommendations Rather it just compiled what they believed to be a series of facts about transactions that have been undertaken over the last several years Enrons board management and Creditors Committee are now working together to evaluate the reports findings and take whatever action is required I like many of you am looking forward to management changes that result from these actions because to successfully to restructure the company were going to have to have a management team in place that is credible thats committed to moving forward for the future that is trusted by our outside constituents and are firmly committed to make a new Enron work Next week after the Board meeting I hope to be able to share with you the management changes that are being contemplated and outline a team that Jeffrey and myself are compiling to rebuild the company The Washington hearings this week heated up considerably and made for some either very dull or very expected or pretty interesting television viewing And obviously this has been translated into the daily headlines Hopefully these investigatory processes will continue to help uncover and address any past misconduct or negligence surrounding Enron And with this Im sure well be able to establish appropriate safeguards for employees and shareholders going forward not only for Enron but for other corporations This situation I believe will have a national impact Its going to force the big five accounting firms to change the way they do business in fact it already has Its going to bring in new and more effective reporting rules Its going to put more teeth into the SEC ARISA is going to be modified Theres not a doubt in my mind that Congress or these Committees are eventually going to look at Wall Street and the commercial banks and put them in their sites During the last week Ive spent almost all my time dealing with the companys Creditors Committee and chatting with individual members of the committee to understand their current thinking concerns and issues so we can begin to construct with them an absolutely open agenda a free flow of information a free flow of communications and begin to work with them to develop a plan to reorganize Enron As I continue to look at our various businesses Im as optimistic as I was a week ago that there is a reorganizable platform here that ought to allow us if everybody is reasonable and responsible and we can begin to put some of our emotions aside to create a viable strong company that ought to be able to be successfully reorganized In any event Ill continue to keep you updated as we move forward In the meantime if you have any specific questions or comments about Enron or its restructuring or anything else thats on your mind dont hesitate to either send me an email or give me a buzz and I will do the best I can to respond as quickly as possible If my response isnt satisfactory the first time around just buzz me again Listen everyone have a wonderful weekend and I hope to see you next week in Houston Byebye STEPHEN F COOPER VOICEMAIL Tuesday January Good morning everyone this is Steve Cooper its the morning of January th and I wanted to take an opportunity to introduce myself and tell you how pleased I am to have been selected as Enrons interim CEO My firm Zolfo Cooper my partners and I have assisted hundreds of companies as they have worked their way through the restructuring and reorganization process I just wanted to give you some of my thoughts about it as we move forward I cant imagine what the past few months have been like for all of you Im sure its been incredibly difficult particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched In that environment Ive got to believe its difficult if not impossible for you to focus on what lies ahead for Enron and for the organization Im not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning however Id like to tell you how we typically approach situations like this Its been the experience of myself my firm my partners that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings Those metrics are typically the organization the asset base that the company has to bring to bear customer base and liquidity From what Ive been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here Enron has a very very bright very capable very committed hardworking and dedicated organization All of the people I have met are committed to reorganize restructure and bring Enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcy Number the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here The regulated assets the pipelines the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure around Third loyal customers Most of Enrons customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basis And fourth liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand the cash it expects to generate in the near term and with the backstop of the DIP financing it doesnt appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forward With those four resources nicely in place Im very confident that we can successfully restructure this company I dont want to leave the impression that it will be easy Its going to be an enormous amount of work There will be upsets issues and concerns along the way But I can tell you that Ive seen companies in bankruptcy that dont have nearly as strong a position as this company They were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy and Im certain Enron will also Im looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and Im very pleased to be here Jeff Ray and I will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward If there are any thoughts concerns issues that you would like to bring to my attention please dont hesitate to drop me a note or give me a call Thanks so much and I look forward to working with all of you

providing the following transcripts of those messages STEPHEN F COOPER VOICEMAIL Friday February Hi everybody This is Steve Cooper Its about or oclock Houston time Friday afternoon Its been a pretty hectic week but Id like to take just a moment to bring everybody up to date so that everybody is fully in the loop with whats gone on this last week Beginning last weekend the Boards special investigative committee released a fairly lengthy report in fact its about odd pages and its fairly pointed and blunt The report was troubling and as Im sure any number of you has seen from the various investigatory committees this week its findings have further dented our corporate history Nonetheless I just wanted to let you know that my role and the job Im paid to do and hopefully the job all of you are getting paid to do is to look forward and proceed that way at percent full speed I continue to believe we really have a lot to look forward to The committee and the report didnt offer any specific recommendations Rather it just compiled what they believed to be a series of facts about transactions that have been undertaken over the last several years Enrons board management and Creditors Committee are now working together to evaluate the reports findings and take whatever action is required I like many of you am looking forward to management changes that result from these actions because to successfully to restructure the company were going to have to have a management team in place that is credible thats committed to moving forward for the future that is trusted by our outside constituents and are firmly committed to make a new Enron work Next week after the Board meeting I hope to be able to share with you the management changes that are being contemplated and outline a team that Jeffrey and myself are compiling to rebuild the company The Washington hearings this week heated up considerably and made for some either very dull or very expected or pretty interesting television viewing And obviously this has been translated into the daily headlines Hopefully these investigatory processes will continue to help uncover and address any past misconduct or negligence surrounding Enron And with this Im sure well be able to establish appropriate safeguards for employees and shareholders going forward not only for Enron but for other corporations This situation I believe will have a national impact Its going to force the big five accounting firms to change the way they do business in fact it already has Its going to bring in new and more effective reporting rules Its going to put more teeth into the SEC ARISA is going to be modified Theres not a doubt in my mind that Congress or these Committees are eventually going to look at Wall Street and the commercial banks and put them in their sites During the last week Ive spent almost all my time dealing with the companys Creditors Committee and chatting with individual members of the committee to understand their current thinking concerns and issues so we can begin to construct with them an absolutely open agenda a free flow of information a free flow of communications and begin to work with them to develop a plan to reorganize Enron As I continue to look at our various businesses Im as optimistic as I was a week ago that there is a reorganizable platform here that ought to allow us if everybody is reasonable and responsible and we can begin to put some of our emotions aside to create a viable strong company that ought to be able to be successfully reorganized In any event Ill continue to keep you updated as we move forward In the meantime if you have any specific questions or comments about Enron or its restructuring or anything else thats on your mind dont hesitate to either send me an email or give me a buzz and I will do the best I can to respond as quickly as possible If my response isnt satisfactory the first time around just buzz me again Listen everyone have a wonderful weekend and I hope to see you next week in Houston Byebye STEPHEN F COOPER VOICEMAIL Tuesday January Good morning everyone this is Steve Cooper its the morning of January th and I wanted to take an opportunity to introduce myself and tell you how pleased I am to have been selected as Enrons interim CEO My firm Zolfo Cooper my partners and I have assisted hundreds of companies as they have worked their way through the restructuring and reorganization process I just wanted to give you some of my thoughts about it as we move forward I cant imagine what the past few months have been like for all of you Im sure its been incredibly difficult particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched In that environment Ive got to believe its difficult if not impossible for you to focus on what lies ahead for Enron and for the organization Im not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning however Id like to tell you how we typically approach situations like this Its been the experience of myself my firm my partners that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings Those metrics are typically the organization the asset base that the company has to bring to bear customer base and liquidity From what Ive been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here Enron has a very very bright very capable very committed hardworking and dedicated organization All of the people I have met are committed to reorganize restructure and bring Enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcy Number the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here The regulated assets the pipelines the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure around Third loyal customers Most of Enrons customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basis And fourth liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand the cash it expects to generate in the near term and with the backstop of the DIP financing it doesnt appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forward With those four resources nicely in place Im very confident that we can successfully restructure this company I dont want to leave the impression that it will be easy Its going to be an enormous amount of work There will be upsets issues and concerns along the way But I can tell you that Ive seen companies in bankruptcy that dont have nearly as strong a position as this company They were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy and Im certain Enron will also Im looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and Im very pleased to be here Jeff Ray and I will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward If there are any thoughts concerns issues that you would like to bring to my attention please dont hesitate to drop me a note or give me a call Thanks so much and I look forward to working with all of you
