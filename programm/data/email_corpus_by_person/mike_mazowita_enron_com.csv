McMichael Jr Ed Barbe Robin Subjectponderosa plant service events for gas days june Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days I hope we dont need Events of June Gas service to the plant has been challenging Lonestar Pipeline is runnin g a pig for June Lonestar told us that roughly would be cut A pparently Friday May Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti es the maintenance information He also indicated that our Lonestarrep said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system was LonestarCarthage and LonestarKaty Plant Neither of the plants supp liers ApacheCinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day June Cuts did occur as we were warned Of the total nomination of M M MM flowed for todays gas flow The supplier breakout is ApacheCi nergy MM and WilliamsMM Yesterday Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for todays flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June I also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a backup The plant ca n burn No low sulfur fuel oil Mike indicated that the plant would not w ant to do that and hadnt burned oil in quite some time I told Mike that I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera ge with the suppliers He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t he plant I told him that I wasnt familiar with Lonestar specifically but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a plant of its size they probably have remote control capabilities If not they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language Th e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right to choose the supply pointpoints into Lonestars system from a list of pri mary or secondary points in Exhibit A If the plants transportation contr act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in to Lonestars system at a location that will flow on the plants transporta tion agreement If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels Yeste rday I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy T om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didnt have a copy of the amendment Sounds like the amendment may have changed some of the delivery points I told Tom at Cinergy that my primary concern w as flowing gas supply to the plant Tom was suggesting that this may be a force majuere event I told him I didnt interpretthe force majuere lan guage that way The force majuere language addresses freezeoffs and line breaks but not maintenance I also told him that the contract has a provis ion for transportation interruption In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op erational issues and not monetary issues I told him we could address the financial resolution per the contract after the event was over I told him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th e pipe cutting back their gas supply Events of June This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy They are supplying MM at AquilaKaty into Lonestar for June Williams is buying MM at Carthage and MM at HLPL for June Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju ne Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June after the pigging was completed They will pay back the volume ratably fo r the remainder or in a day Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around to say the plant needed to cut back to the MM flowing gas volume for today The plants burn rate was causing the pig to run to fast Russ is the manager of the transp ortation administration department at Lonestar I called Russ back at pm to inquire about the problem I asked him to call gas control and see w hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem I also called Mike to inform him of the new events Russ called back and said the run would b e over at pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul d help was El Paso Field ServicesEnnis He also indicated that the pressu re had stabilized and the plant may be able to make it through the run without the incremental gas I called Cinergy a nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou ld let me know At Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and the cost would be to more than the contract price She said t hat they didnt think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract They would buy the gas if we would agree to pay the price I called Mike at White Pines a nd ask him what he wanted to do He indicated that he wanted us me to buy the gas I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the n om Russ said the plant was burning more Now they were burning MM and requested they cut back to their nominated volume of MM I told Russ I d idnt think that they could be I would call Mike confirmed that they coul d not He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off eve n to MW He said Brazos is playing chicken and are requesting ever ything they have I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the co ntract after the pigging event is completed I called Michelle with my pro posal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back We agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after the event was over Michelle called back and said the gas was going to com e from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered Events of June The plant made it through the June gas day on gas I spoke with Michelle and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June the sa me as June She said that Apache didnt think they were liable to make u p the gas they shorted us for June She said I could talk with Pat Green at Apache regarding the issue Williams moved their gas from Carthage to HPL for June I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the poin t I requested that Kevin do the same with his Lonestar contact Neith er of us has had a return call from our corresponding Lonestar counterparti es We will have to address the issue intraday if necessary I will keep everyone posted of any new developments
