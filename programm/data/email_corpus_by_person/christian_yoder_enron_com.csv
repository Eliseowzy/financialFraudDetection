considering one of these deals Difficult as it is to predict things in California because of continual reversals it appears for now that history is continuing to smile on our decision not to take the regulatory risk by entering into one of these infamous contracts That very risk which we sought to imagine and draft contractual language to deal with now looms up before everybodys incredulous eyes cgy Original Message From Hall Steve C Legal Sent Monday October AM To Yoder Christian Subject FW Pacificorp Power Marketing under fire This could have been us Original Message From Hall Steve C Legal Sent Monday October AM To Subject Pacificorp Power Marketing under fire State PUC seeks to void Davis power contracts Deals gouge consumers agency tells federal regulators Bernadette Tansey Chronicle Staff Writer mailto Monday October San Francisco Chronicle chronicleinfocopyright URL cgibinarticlecgifcaMNDTL In a move that could undermine Californias hardwon control of the power market state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov Gray Davis The state Public Utilities Commission in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governors power strategy is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the states power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices and it wants some of those prices cut The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if theyre not renegotiated Commissioner Richard Bilas said I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Its definitely not something thats a favorable thing to have happen to us said Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources which negotiated the contracts Hidalgo said the longterm contracts even though more expensive than current market prices are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out Hidalgo said If thats the goal then were back to square one Prices would start to creep up The state is paying an average of a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators Peak prices for electricity last week were less than Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases Over the past three months lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc Alliance Colton LLC Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp subsidiary said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher SEMPRA CALPINE CONTRACTS Taken together Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of agreements some of which last years In all California has committed to spending at least billion for electricity The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the billion contract one of Davis energy consultants owned stock in the power suppliers parent company Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldnt comment until it had studied the PUC submissions The PUCs challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five member commission which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governors three appointees The commission has rebuffed Davis attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the longterm power contracts and pay off the planned billion bond issue STATE TREASURERS WARNING State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUCs actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a billion hole in the state budget next year PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubberstamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer We should not through the instrument of the bonds lock down the policy choices for the state for years Lynch said last week We should stay as flexible as possible Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commissions challenges to the contracts Commissioner Jeff Brown Lynchs fellow Davis appointee said the filings dont rule out Davis bond financing deal Nor do they threaten a state default on the longterm contracts he said But federal action could help the state improve the deals he said The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract he said Even if we renegotiate well renegotiate within the confines of the contract Hidalgo however said he doubted the state could modify the contracts Under power granted by the Legislature he said the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable Jan Mitchell a spokeswoman for ScottishPower parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations Now another California agency is disputing it Mitchell said We obviously disagree and well continue to work with FERC making sure the contracts are honored PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its year billion deal with the company July That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts the PUC says News reports suggest that the water department paid substantially over the thencurrent market prices for this contract prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers the PUC said An energy consultant to Davis Vikram Budhraja admitted in August that he owned as much as worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out Budhraja sold the stock July and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the states energy picture While the issue has slipped from the public eye Davis solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edisons finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing While officials fight among themselves the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation PGES PLANT PROPOSAL PGE Corp has proposed to emerge from bankruptcy protection by transferring all the power plants it still owns as well as its natural gas and power transmission lines into subsidiaries free of state regulation PGE says it will protect consumers from a replay of this years price spikes by selling the power from its new freemarket plants at a stable rate through contracts that phase out in nine to years Consumer advocates and state regulators say that stable rate cents a kilowatt hour is more than percent higher than PGE now gets under state regulation Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Santa Cruz County warned that the state could be heading into a second wave of the energy crisis The problem with this new phase were going into is that the concepts are more theoretical and the impacts are very much delayed Keeley said There wont be the same urgency to wrestle this energy monster to the ground Email Bernadette Tansey at mailto San Francisco Chronicle chronicleinfocopyright Page A

way through the Market Monitoring investigation Please keep forwarding everything like it that you come upon Elizabeth said by voice mail Thursday that she is going to be lining up our outside counsel to wor k on this and would be calling you soon I am going to be out of the office from June July Some of what is expressed in the conversation about the incident is consistent with one of my own instincts about the matter which is that nobody including the PX Compliance folks should be surprised to learn that the competitive market forces that everybody seems to agree are ver y positive are going to be applied directly to the electronic system qua system Dynamic electronic commerce is going to include a rigorous testing of the very media by which it is conducted The politicians whose supposed wisdom created this mode of commerce and imposed it upon the California energy market cant expect to channel the enormous brawling competitive energy of a big sector of the American economy into a computer software system and then throw up their hands and interpret certain kind of commercial results from the perspective of the good old days of preelectronic commerce Certain kinds of distortions are going to happen in electronic commerce which would not happen in the absence of this mode o f conducting business and these new kinds of distortions are going to warp and twist the system Presumably those devoted to keeping the system will try to repair it and improve it but in doing so they need to procede ve ry carefully down any path that might lead to pointing an accusing

fascinating week in Burrito land I spent the better part of this week learning something new which at my age is not easy In fact just about everything at my age is getting more difficult But I wont bore you with the details The new thing I learned was how to be an Examiner on the Board of Examiners for this yearFs California GovernorFs Quality Education and Development Award CalQED Its an annual shindig for companies health care institutions and schools to compete for the honor of shaking the GovFs hand and hearing that your pick one company nonprofit school health care institution are world class Being an examiner of the written applications and working with a team of peer examiners is all pro bono on my part I am wondering what the hell I got myself into IFll tell you more about it some other time Speaking of world class I got two top notch letters this week that I want to share with you One from Ken Lackey of Edison Mission Marketing and Trading regarding the May overscheduling on the Silver Peak intertie by MW see Lori EckmanFs note to me in last weekFs Burrito and a reply to KenFs letter from George Sladoje CEO of the PX Ken who I have known for several years is a person who doesnFt speak out unless something really bothers him Ken wrote FSince Day Ive always wondered what mechanism was in place to protect against this scenario overscheduling on an intertie or if this scenario would be regarded as a market implementation flaw or feature I always figured it was a feature simply because I didnt think that a hole this large would be unintentionally overlooked I also figured that this feature was available for use by market participants and that if it became overused that it would eventually come under scrutiny by the market compliance police I also wondered if people could use this to change spreads in such a way as to improve their overall positions I also figured that for the most part there is no such thing as artificially high prices since in my opinion the market design itself is somewhat artificial But now I know the truthits a flaw it was overlooked and there is no protectionamazing FI certainly do not agree with George Sladojes interpretation of the PX tariff that overscheduling across a path constitutes improper implementation of a generator schedule which therefore constitutes a violation of the tariff Also I believe that it is completely inappropriate for the burden of proper functioning of the market to rest on the shoulders of the market participants ie if someone types in an incorrect schedule in their PX Trade Application the market should not blowup The responsibility of a properly functioning market lies with the market operator PX itself PX software should validate that the proper mechanics have been used by the market participants FBy the way it wasnt us who caused this situation and of course we would prefer to pay low PX energy prices rather than high but if we review this situation and retroactively recreate prices then perhaps all other cases in which congestion at tiepoints caused high prices should also be reviewed to see if they are real FBy the way typically I would not respond to this sort of thing due to time constraints however some of our recent involvement in other ISOPXs has highlighted the contrasts between California and other ISOPXs Each of them including California has its strengths and weaknesses however its in California where the unusual is the normF I sent KenFs letter to George and his staff at the PX and George wrote back the following FBecause the incident of May is the subject of an official investigation by the PX Compliance unit I cannot comment on the specifics of this matter at this time It is likely that the CalPX Market Monitoring Committee will be involved in the investigation and the results will likely be presented to the CalPX Board of Governors As to the issue of a design flow in the overall California marketplace we are currently reviewing this issue and have requested that the ISO do the same FI disagree with the assertion that CalPX Tariff provision does not apply here In all major exchange operations the institution not only provides a forum for trading but also monitors the activities of its members both currently and after the fact The participants are expected to follow the rules At one of my previous employers as an example the Chicago Board of Trade a suspected abuse or a compliant from another member or customer results in an investigation by the Office of Investigations and Audits the counterpart of CalPXFs Compliance unit Depending on the nature of the issue the investigation results are presented to the Floor Governors Committee Business Conduct Committee or the Financial Compliance Committee These bodies then determine if additional investigation is warranted and if the issue requires Board of Director action FSimilarly the CalPX has the obligation to investigate and take actions against participants who violate tariff provisions Our recently filed sanctionFs protocol formalizes the process further and describes a series of penalties which can be imposed Therefore we believe our tariff does provide adequate protection FFinally as to whether a comparable event has occurred in the past this will be part of the investigation process and a review of market design Obviously impact schedule submissions above ATC limits have happened as a result of free and open markets Congestion has become an almost regular occurrence The real issues under investigation in this incident are magnitude intent and materiality of impact on our marketplaceF Thank you both Ken and George for those comments I am sure we will hear from other members on the issue Lori donFt be silent You started this thing DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDD Speaking of market design segues I am very big on segues this week old warrior dear friend and defender of the just Carl Imparato had a few things to say about the ISOFs proposed utilization of ex post GMMs Carl wrote FYesterday the ISO Market Analysis Unit stated that not implementing afterthefact GMMs would be a departure from the original vision of the California market structure FEx post GMMs were NOT a part of the market structure When I was at PGE and we were developing the tariff in early no one not at PGE SCE or any other market participant to my knowledge ever advocated ex post GMMs and they were NOT included in the tariff I dont recall the words state estimator for calculation such GMMs ever being uttered by anyone in a WEPEX stakeholder meeting FIt was only somewhere in mid when Alex was working on UFE equations that Alex I believe suddenly came up with the proposal for ex post GMMs and the proposal was taken by ISO very quickly before it had ANY discussion in SCUG or any other forum and was adopted by the ISO Board or whatever group passed for the Board at that time Immediately thereafter virtually everyone in SCUG We were ignored FBut even in early we informally agreed that in light of the facts that afterthefact GMMs were not part of the original deal afterthefact GMM implementation would be given low priority and we would be given opportunity to discuss this issue before ISO moved forwardF I remember those discussions Carl I wonder if deals made in have any meaning today DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD The SCE Pilot Forwards Program a continuing saga for WPTF popped up again this week I visited with Commissioner Bilas on Monday to encourage him to stay the course and support the ALJFs preliminary decision to reject SCEFs Application and cancel the hearings on legal and procedural grounds Dick said that he supported that notion but he couldnFt guarantee that all his colleagues would Alas two days later Commissioner Joe Neeper who clearly had too much time on his hands this week issued a public statement which is long but here is a taste FALJ HaleFs Proposed Decision PD is structured so that a Yes vote will terminate the proceeding and a No vote will continue the proceeding to hearings and ultimate resolution I have concerns wit h the PD However I do not intend to issue an alternate because should my concerns not be addressed I have the option to vote No which would have the same effect as the alternate I otherwise would have written FIf we vote to allow this application to move to hearings we can later determine whether the Application should be approved on overall policy grounds The PD dismisses the Application on the grounds that does not comply with what is known as the buysell requirement for utilities to sell all of their generation into and purchase all of their energy needs for their bundled customers out of the PX I agree with the ALJ and the Assigned Commissioner that the Application also must be compatible with the buysell requirement in order to be approved and that this threshold decision is therefore necessary FThe PD concludes that the Application makes SCEFs customers more vulnerable to market power abuseIn viewing the comments of parties I find the concern about market power abuse to be expressed best by Western Power Trading Forum WPTF in its opening brief WPTF states on page that under SCEFs proposal ESPs will no longer be able to compete with utilities on the basis of shortrun incremental costs in an open setting as envisioned by the PPDThus ESPs would find it increasingly more difficult to compete with an Edison price which was neither derived from a transparent PX price nor reflective of the retail market in which ESPs must participate The PX price is determined in an open setting and would continue to be determined in an open setting under SCEFs proposalI cannot find that the proposal would violate the PPD by necessarily leading to abuse of market power Market power concerns should be considered and weighed against consumer and other interests These issues certainly can be explored in greater depth as policy matters in hearings FI do not believe the Application by SCE is in violation of the CommissionFs Preferred Policy Decision The merits of the Applicatio n should be considered through the hearing process and voted upon by the Commissioners F Well Mr Neeper justice isnFt free A hearing is expensive and what your are doing is raising the ante of staying in the gameunnecessarily That supports the incumbents UDCs and hurts us At the time I am writing this Burrito I do not know if the Commission took action on this matter today or punted it to the July meeting IFll keep you posted next week DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD I am sure most of you have seen the press releases which came out last week First Dynegy and Illinova are merging and second NEV is being purchased by AES Both Dynegy and NEV are Voting members of WPTF I was going to send Illinova a solicitation letter to join WPTF but now I think IFll take that off my Fto doFlist In the NEV deal the AES Corporation announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire New Energy Ventures in a transaction valued at approximately million AES will acquire all of the outstanding shares of New Energy Ventures from its current owners UniSource Energy Corporation and New Energy Holdings LLC which is owned by senior management of New Energy Ventures This is an incredible coincidence I was just telling someone I think it was Dan Douglass that we ought to give a special award to Nancy Day of NEV who is a big fan of the Burrito and quite possibly although I am not certain one of the senior managers of that lucky corporation Well heck she has been at NEV from the beginning so she deserves all the financial success in the world and we wish her well I just want to share with all our Burrito readers that WPTF a taxexempt nonprofit corporation Tax ID right here in the State of California soon to be a CalQED award winner is looking for donors for the soontobeannounced Executive DirectorFs fund Some of you might not know about this new slush fund It is intended to provide all the necessary tools and ancillary needs of late night policy pow wows attended by the usual wonks and otherwise homeless lobbyists who invade my private hotel room during the WPTF general meeting and who want to discuss high level stuff all through the night WhatFs an executive director to do So Nancy I was just thinking we could launch this program in your honor with your name all over the thing and get this very important and much needed program in place At least it will pay for a hotel room for Curtis who consistently falls asleep during these meetings on my hotelroom couch while Beth Emery is lecturing him By the way if God forbid the deal falls through then forget I wrote all this Have a great weekend Think quality gba

Subject Seattle City Utility Racks Up Million in Power Purchases in March MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetusascii ContentDisposition inline FYI Seattle City Utility Racks Up Million in Power Purchases in March Jim Brunner The Seattle Times April Apr Seattle City Light spent a record million buying power on the market in March more than any month in its year history City Light officials say the cost of buying power for local residents and businesses eclipsed the previous records million set in February and nearly million in January To put that in perspective In before the current power crisis the utilitys total power bill for the entire year was million Were spending that every month now The dollars that are involved are staggering said Paula Green deputy superintendent of City Light Its a cash hemorrhage brought on by Washingtons drought which means less water in the reservoirs at cityowned dams That increases Seattles need to purchase electricity on a market where prices have zoomed to unprecedented levels Adding to the frustration for Seattle city officials is the fact that most of that money is flowing to outofstate utilities and power brokers who are profiting enormously from the energy crunch Last month alone the bill from Enron a Houstonbased corporation was million putting it well ahead of the No seller Californias Sempra Energy which sold million worth of electricity to City Light City Light still gets most of the megawatts necessary to serve its load from cityowned dams and from its contract with the Bonneville Power Administration BPA The utility buys only about percent of its power on the market But that thin slice now accounts for more than percent of its power costs Part of the explanation for Marchs record powerbuying binge was City Lights recent decision to store up extra water behind Ross Dam on the Skagit River instead of spilling it through the dams power turbines In a normal water year City Light officials would be spilling water for energy and expecting it would be replaced with spring runoff Now theyre saving the water so it can be spilled later to help salmon runs and to generate power for Seattle this summer when energy prices are expected to surge even higher to more than per megawatt hour Were insulating ourselves By putting out one eye now were avoiding cutting off our head later said Bob Royer City Light spokesman Seattle ratepayers are feeling the pain with a percent City Light rate increase so far this year More rate increases are likely on the way Higher rates have also led to plant closures and layoffs in Bellingham and Spokane Meanwhile Enrons revenues more than doubled last year to billion Its stock prices surged to end the year at a share up from the year before The stock was trading at a share last week It doesnt just feel unfair but immoral that these major companies like Enron are making billions of dollars at the expense of everyday people and businesses said City Councilwoman Heidi Wills who chairs the Councils Energy and Environmental Policy Committee Theres this enormous transfer of wealth from our ratepayers to the shareholders of these companies Wills said Northwest leaders have called for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose price caps But opponents say price caps would do nothing to encourage the construction of new power plants or energy conservation Karen Denne an Enron spokeswoman said its unfair to fault the company for selling power at prices dictated by the free market Enron is providing electricity to a market that needs it Denne said Its unfortunate when regulators are pointing fingers looking to fix blame when this is a problem of supply and demand The company hails from President George W Bushs home state of Texas and is one of the top soft money donors to political campaigns Enron and its executives gave to the Democrats and million to Republicans last year according to Common Cause Its chairman Kenneth Lay has consistently been one of the top donors to Bushs presidential and gubernatorial campaigns Enron doesnt own a lot of dams or power plants Instead the company makes money as a middleman buying power from utilities and then reselling it for a profit The company formed in from the merger of two pipeline companies has become the largest trader of wholesale electricity in North America Part of its success in the energy market stems from its groundbreaking use of the Internet to make buying electricity as easy as ordering a book online You just point click and spend Its easier than Amazon said Steve Lewis a power marketer with City Light demonstrating the companys Web site It lists available power products and the asking price for both buyers and sellers Lewis and other power marketers monitor City Lights projected power needs and then use the phone or Internet to schedule electricity for the next hour next day or months ahead They try to find the best price available but its clearly a sellers market Utilities routinely buy power that used to cost per megawatt hour for more than At times last month City Light was buying power for a megawatt hour And its not because the cost of generation has gone up This is pure profit said Green deputy superintendent of City Light There is evidence that the Northwest is in some ways being hit even harder than California whose experiment with deregulation is blamed for roiling the power markets A recent analysis found that Pacific Northwest utilities are paying the highest prices in the nation for the nextday delivery of wholesale power However regional utilities also sell power for extraordinarily high prices In fact some of the highest average prices paid by City Light last month were to neighbors Puget Sound Energy Western Washingtons largest electric utility charged City Light the highest average price of any seller last month at per megawatt hour according to City Lights preliminary billing estimates Spokanes Avista Energy charged That compares with Enrons average price of per megawatt hour and an overall average of The BPA by comparison charges City Light per megawatt hour City Light typically relies on local utilities more when it needs power delivered immediately And prices for shortterm deals can be higher depending on the time of day The city has only a longterm contract with the BPA D espite the recordsetting month city officials hope theyll be in better shape before the year is out Mayor Paul Schell has taken to calling Oct Seattles energy independence day because thats when the city will begin receiving more hydroelectric power under a new contract with the BPA The historically cheap BPA power combined with a contract with a gasfired power plant in Klamath Falls Ore should reduce the citys reliance on the open market city officials say But the BPA too has been stricken by higher market power costs and may have to increase its rates to City Light by percent The City Council has already agreed to pass those higher costs on to Seattle ratepayers although its unclear how much that would raise the bill of the average person Even at a higher rate City Light officials regard the BPA power as a good longterm strategy for getting power costs under control If they succeed the rate increases approved this year could eventually be rescinded Until then local ratepayers will have to keep writing bigger checks to City Light with the knowledge that some of their money will find its way to Texas To see more of The Seattle Times or to subscribe to the newspaper go to

cgy Original Message From Hall Steve C Legal Sent Monday October AM To Yoder Christian Subject FW Pacificorp Power Marketing under fire This could have been us Original Message From Hall Steve C Legal Sent Monday October AM To Subject Pacificorp Power Marketing under fire State PUC seeks to void Davis power contracts Deals gouge consumers agency tells federal regulators Bernadette Tansey Chronicle Staff Writer mailto Monday October San Francisco Chronicle chronicleinfocopyright URL cgibinarticlecgifcaMNDTL In a move that could undermine Californias hardwon control of the power market state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov Gray Davis The state Public Utilities Commission in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governors power strategy is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the states power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices and it wants some of those prices cut The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if theyre not renegotiated Commissioner Richard Bilas said I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Its definitely not something thats a favorable thing to have happen to us said Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources which negotiated the contracts Hidalgo said the longterm contracts even though more expensive than current market prices are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out Hidalgo said If thats the goal then were back to square one Prices would start to creep up The state is paying an average of a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators Peak prices for electricity last week were less than Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases Over the past three months lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc Alliance Colton LLC Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp subsidiary said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher SEMPRA CALPINE CONTRACTS Taken together Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of agreements some of which last years In all California has committed to spending at least billion for electricity The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the billion contract one of Davis energy consultants owned stock in the power suppliers parent company Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldnt comment until it had studied the PUC submissions The PUCs challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five member commission which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governors three appointees The commission has rebuffed Davis attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the longterm power contracts and pay off the planned billion bond issue STATE TREASURERS WARNING State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUCs actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a billion hole in the state budget next year PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubberstamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer We should not through the instrument of the bonds lock down the policy choices for the state for years Lynch said last week We should stay as flexible as possible Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commissions challenges to the contracts Commissioner Jeff Brown Lynchs fellow Davis appointee said the filings dont rule out Davis bond financing deal Nor do they threaten a state default on the longterm contracts he said But federal action could help the state improve the deals he said The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract he said Even if we renegotiate well renegotiate within the confines of the contract Hidalgo however said he doubted the state could modify the contracts Under power granted by the Legislature he said the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable Jan Mitchell a spokeswoman for ScottishPower parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations Now another California agency is disputing it Mitchell said We obviously disagree and well continue to work with FERC making sure the contracts are honored PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its year billion deal with the company July That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts the PUC says News reports suggest that the water department paid substantially over the thencurrent market prices for this contract prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers the PUC said An energy consultant to Davis Vikram Budhraja admitted in August that he owned as much as worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out Budhraja sold the stock July and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the states energy picture While the issue has slipped from the public eye Davis solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edisons finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing While officials fight among themselves the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation PGES PLANT PROPOSAL PGE Corp has proposed to emerge from bankruptcy protection by transferring all the power plants it still owns as well as its natural gas and power transmission lines into subsidiaries free of state regulation PGE says it will protect consumers from a replay of this years price spikes by selling the power from its new freemarket plants at a stable rate through contracts that phase out in nine to years Consumer advocates and state regulators say that stable rate cents a kilowatt hour is more than percent higher than PGE now gets under state regulation Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Santa Cruz County warned that the state could be heading into a second wave of the energy crisis The problem with this new phase were going into is that the concepts are more theoretical and the impacts are very much delayed Keeley said There wont be the same

agree with Christian that we cannot win over the WSPP folks simply by telling them that their contract is not as good as ours Everytime I venture out to the larger NW community of IOUs munis and federal PMAs I realize that the WSPP is more than a contract its almost a religion One cannot convince a Muslim that the Bible is better written than the Koran Whether its assimilation or merger or the hint that the WSPP might be destined for a larger role in advocacy and education we need to give Mike Small a facesaving way of relinquishing the WSPP contract Modifying the WSPP to look like the

and the other is going to be a technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of scary war stories I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron policy on WSPP approach Unless you agree with and support this kind of How Enron views the WSPP policy I shouldnt be advocating it at the meeting Enrons view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI should be coming to an end It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI experts to merge the agreements Everybody is wasting too much time comparing the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other Every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements one that is almost like the other one Valuable resource time is being wasted Enron believes that a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best provide an extremely useful industry formum kind of function The WSPP should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for RTO West dealing with the emerging California changes and open access in Oregon and Nevada Right now the highly talented regional organization is spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center This unfortunate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions The WSPP organization is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ever narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because our marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondoggles Sales people do not want to feel alone and different They are all about the slimy intimacy of sales It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cour dLane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult questions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such He wants to feel loved Therefore this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP for being a great organization but at the same time advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects Rosman should say Enron loves the WSPP it has done a great job with the contract reformation that task is done we now should move on to bigger and better tasks Lets get the contract stuff wrapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agenda Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess Otherwise we pit Enrons clearmindedness against a stubborn mass of inert resistance and much toxic upheaval is the only result The world including our little western power world is not made up of people sitting around trying to be rational It is full of all of the conflicts of history ambitious tirades irrational idiocyncracies and strong personalities The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon They are not going to go away Enron needs to be more subtle in its regional diplomacy Praise them as we bury them on the contract front As our headquarters commander I beg you to let Steve and me as field operatives pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months We can wind these guys up to talk this kind of talk next Wednesday One

wraps In secret a Capitol panel is deposing key p layers in the lifting of a power price cap By John Hill Bee Capitol Bureau Published Oct A legislative committee is taking secret depositions of energy officials in a highly unusual effort to shed light on events that some believe triggere d Californias energy crisis almost a year ago The depositions whose format was spelled out in a Senate resolution in Jul y represent a first for any state Legislature in the United States accord ing to Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana Dunn a lawyer who chairs the Senate Sel ect Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Mar ket is taking most of the depositions Dunn said the secrecy is meant to prevent unfounded rumors from becoming pu blic Were trying to do this investigation in a thorough and professional fashi on he said Im not interested in tarnishing anybody or any company with information that doesnt turn out to be true But some think the secrecy is unwarranted and makes the testimony prone to manipulation My concern is that if we have secret depositions and the committee starts issuing reports the full context of what was said or talked about does not come to true light said Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Inde pendent Energy Producers a trade association representing independent ener gy facilities and power marketers SmutnyJones the former board chairman of the states electrical grid operator is scheduled to testify in early N ovember Sen Ray Haynes RRiverside voted against the July resolution that laid t he groundwork for the depositions and still has misgivings about the proces s Whenever you have politicians doing an investigation like that theres a risk that the investigation turns into a circus especially when its done in secret Haynes said Secrecy could allow people to play hide and seek with the testimony he s aid releasing only those parts that support one theory It could also allo w the witnesses to attack the committees findings by arguing that the whol e story wasnt told Over time it hurts them Haynes said All subpoenas issued by Dunns committee went to current or former board members or staff of the Independent System Operator If those called on to give testimony want it public Dunn said he would gr ant the request So far no one has asked What some energy officials really want Dunn said is access to other depos itions Were not going to give folks the opportunity to compare stories he said Theres no reason they need to see what other people said The grid operator would prefer the testimony to be open said spokeswoman S tephanie McCorkle As of Monday Dunn had not informed the Independent Syst em Operator officials that they can choose to make their testimony public she said We think it would be a great opportunity to explain some of the complex is sues the grid operator faced last December McCorkle said The committee is focusing on events in early December when Terry Wint er president and chief executive officer of the Independent System Operato r asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to lift a price cap on po wer The cap of per megawatthour was replaced with a soft cap in w hich power sellers could charge more as long as they justified the higher c osts Winter and other managers at the grid operator had a good relationship with the board and were in the habit of consulting with it Dunn said But on Dec Winter submitted the emergency filing without letting the bo ard know The ISO board was shocked at that filing Dunn said In response to Winters request the normally slowmoving FERC issued an or der within an hour and a half The series of events caused a lot of people to be very suspicious of what led up to that filing Dunn said The committee is investigating whether Winter and electrical generators eng aged in a concerted effort to bring about the lifting of the price cap It has subpoenaed documents personal calendars emails and phone records Th ree or four depositions have been done with the rest scheduled in the next three weeks Some energy officials say that the theory being investigated by the Dunn co mmittee is fatally flawed If thats where its directed I dont think its going anywhere Smutny Jones said Terry was empowered to take action independently which he did do and it kept the lights on Im very troubled at someone trying to turn Terry Winter into a scapegoat The ISO board at the time was close to totally dysfunctional SmutnyJone s said making it reasonable for Winter to act alone Winters filing and the FERC response are all welldocumented There was no conspiracy no smoking guns there he said The FERC order in fact kept electricity flowing into the state and allowe d the grid operator to seek refunds later McCorkle said Before the order there were literally no bids in our realtime market s he said But Dunn said the FERC had other options such as ordering generators to se ll into the California market Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said ISO officials failed to notify the governor of the emergency filing despite the fact they met w ith him on other matters that day They clearly didnt want the governor to know Maviglio said The Senate resolution says that no one can be present for the depositions e xcept members and staff of Dunns committee the person taking the depositi on an official reporter the person being deposed and his or her counsel Many of the ISO officials have retained private attorneys whose bills will be paid by the grid operator as required by the nonprofit corporations b ylaws The California Constitution allows closed sessions of the Legislature and i ts committees only in certain cases such as party caucuses or to discuss p ending litigation

Saturday November PM To Russo Dianne H Stack Shari Yoder Christian Subject Re Summary of WSPP Nov and meetings I was severely disappointed over being shut out of the WSPP exec committee meeting Apparently when the guy came in to set up the phone for the call Small told him not to do it and sent him out I also agree that there seems to be little regard for the bylaws informality is being used to run roughshod over dissent Since we had a representative present without me his attorney we probably lack standing to make a formal demand that the votes be rescinded until reintroduced under required conditions Otherwise this email would be asking you to join us However as many involved on our end were quite upset disenfranchisement could well become a matter for judicial review if it happens again to PacifiCorp I remain amazed that Small would push for revisions such as those to knowing there was substantial question over their legal effect If indeed Smalls wrong on the law wed be fully prepared to demand undoing these changes due to flawed legal advice from Small and passage out of compliance with the bylaws and to do so jointly with others In fact if I get management okay Id be willing to write a joint objection to file with FERC in response to the introduced amendments There may even be some corporate doctrine under Utah law that prevents a nonprofit from paying for Smalls defense in an internecine dispute Although you are right that now is not the time for a joint WSPPEEI drafting committee I very much like the idea of proposing one under cover of a memo that picks out the highlights of convergence after the EEI process started against the type of amendments that were made before the EEI was on the table as a dramatic way to make the point that Smalls agenda is to drive WSPP towards competition in a niche filled by the EEI and hammer on the other points youve made with which we fully agree I dont know that theres a need to do the convergence analysis exhaustively and academically as opposed to persuasively unless if you think you can convince a law stude nt on a local law review that it would make a good note I also note from the minutes that a Board of Trustees was elected I do not recall being provided with a copy of the slate of nominees in advance of the meeting I admit I didnt spend a lot of time puzzling over it but I dont see from the website or the bylaws the authority under which Small conducts the committee meetings Its interesting how the notes on the first day of the meeting appear to be written by someone who wasnt following the legal issues involved Let me know what you think on the FERC objection idea and whether youd be prepared to join us Original Message From Yoder Christian To Stack Shari Russo Dianne H Sent Wednesday November PM Subject RE Summary of WSPP Nov and meetings Shari Im not sure of what to do about the informal irregularity of the WSPP process I agree with you that there seems to be a lack of basic due process going on but it has always been difficult to understand how and why they do things the way they do History and personality seem to explain it best Right near the end of the Thursday session I believe it was Jeremy Weinstein of PacifiCorp tried to focus Mike on what to me seems to be a crucial and potentially fruitful question Is the WSPP becoming more and more like the EEI and if so does anybody care Mike seemed to feel that there was a vast difference between the two agreements and that this vast difference mattered a lot I think if anybody would take the time to dispassionately examine the steady stream of changes that have been made to the WSPP over the past couple of years the result would be that the two agreements would be seen to be converging rather than diverging I would even take a further step and argue that the convergence has been so steady and effective that the time has now arrived for a Joint EEIWSPP Drafting Committee to harmonize the agreements However I think my suggestion is still premature At this moment in the process it would seem that a comparative document painstakingly showing each amendment of the WSPP agreement and what it looked like in comparison to the EEI needs to be created If convergence is what this objective study shows then at some point the question fairly becomes why not get it over with and merge the documents Is a Joint Drafting Committee a good idea I may be wrong and an academic look at my thesis is certainly required but my instinct is that Mikes notion that a groupadopted agreement is fundamentally different than multiple bilateral agreements is a classic distinction without a difference Why does how the agreement is derived matter if the two agreements are becoming inexorably more and more alike Why should I fly up and down the west coast attending a steady stream of meetings and pay K a year to use one agreement when it is steadily becoming more and more like the other agreement which involves neither inconvenience The creeping imitation of the WSPP process needs to be recognized for what it is I would argue that this approach might bear more fruit than wrangling over process although that too is probably going to be an enduring necessity cgy Original Message From Stack Shari mailto Sent Wednesday November PM To Russo Dianne H Subject FW Summary of WSPP Nov

Committee meeting in Idaho Mike Small again proposed this change but said that there did not need to be a vote since it was going to be part of the operating procedures Now it appears that he has snuck it into the WSPP Agreement and took advantage of the fact that many did not attend the meeting in San Diego in reliance on being able to attend via conference call As we all know Mike Small arbitrarily canceled the call that would have allowed us to participate in the Executive Committee meeting I suspect he did so because he knew we would object to this clause and therefore the would not have been achieved Any thoughts on what to do about this S A new Section to limit changes to the WSPP Agreement that may be made automatically through the confirmation process after the five day was adopted Under this new provision nonstandard confirmation provisions eg changes to the basic terms of the WSPP Agreement may be adopted only if there is explicit agreement to those changes and not by operation of the five day rule The modification adopted at the Executive Committee was to limit the oral agreements allowing such modifications to transactions of less than one week This provision as modified was adopted with only one dissenting vote Original Message From WINNIE HOWARD mailto Sent Wednesday November AM To Russo Dianne Stack Shari Subject Summary of WSPP Nov and meetings WSPP

Utility Racks Up Million in Power Purchases in March Please note the attention paid to Enron ContentTransferEncoding quotedprintable Date Wed Apr From Tracey Bradley To Paul Fox Cc Ronald Carroll Subject Seattle City Utility Racks Up Million in Power Purchases in March MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetusascii ContentDisposition inline FYI Seattle City Utility Racks Up Million in Power Purchases in March Jim Brunner The Seattle Times April Apr Seattle City Light spent a record million buying power on the market in March more than any month in its year history City Light officials say the cost of buying power for local residents and businesses eclipsed the previous records million set in February and nearly million in January To put that in perspective In before the current power crisis the utilitys total power bill for the entire year was million Were spending that every month now The dollars that are involved are staggering said Paula Green deputy superintendent of City Light Its a cash hemorrhage brought on by Washingtons drought which means less water in the reservoirs at cityowned dams That increases Seattles need to purchase electricity on a market where prices have zoomed to unprecedented levels Adding to the frustration for Seattle city officials is the fact that most of that money is flowing to outofstate utilities and power brokers who are profiting enormously from the energy crunch Last month alone the bill from Enron a Houstonbased corporation was million putting it well ahead of the No seller Californias Sempra Energy which sold million worth of electricity to City Light City Light still gets most of the megawatts necessary to serve its load from cityowned dams and from its contract with the Bonneville Power Administration BPA The utility buys only about percent of its power on the market But that thin slice now accounts for more than percent of its power costs Part of the explanation for Marchs record powerbuying binge was City Lights recent decision to store up extra water behind Ross Dam on the Skagit River instead of spilling it through the dams power turbines In a normal water year City Light officials would be spilling water for energy and expecting it would be replaced with spring runoff Now theyre saving the water so it can be spilled later to help salmon runs and to generate power for Seattle this summer when energy prices are expected to surge even higher to more than per megawatt hour Were insulating ourselves By putting out one eye now were avoiding cutting off our head later said Bob Royer City Light spokesman Seattle ratepayers are feeling the pain with a percent City Light rate increase so far this year More rate increases are likely on the way Higher rates have also led to plant closures and layoffs in Bellingham and Spokane Meanwhile Enrons revenues more than doubled last year to billion Its stock prices surged to end the year at a share up from the year before The stock was trading at a share last week It doesnt just feel unfair but immoral that these major companies like Enron are making billions of dollars at the expense of everyday people and businesses said City Councilwoman Heidi Wills who chairs the Councils Energy and Environmental Policy Committee Theres this enormous transfer of wealth from our ratepayers to the shareholders of these companies Wills said Northwest leaders have called for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose price caps But opponents say price caps would do nothing to encourage the construction of new power plants or energy conservation Karen Denne an Enron spokeswoman said its unfair to fault the company for selling power at prices dictated by the free market Enron is providing electricity to a market that needs it Denne said Its unfortunate when regulators are pointing fingers looking to fix blame when this is a problem of supply and demand The company hails from President George W Bushs home state of Texas and is one of the top soft money donors to political campaigns Enron and its executives gave to the Democrats and million to Republicans last year according to Common Cause Its chairman Kenneth Lay has consistently been one of the top donors to Bushs presidential and gubernatorial campaigns Enron doesnt own a lot of dams or power plants Instead the company makes money as a middleman buying power from utilities and then reselling it for a profit The company formed in from the merger of two pipeline companies has become the largest trader of wholesale electricity in North America Part of its success in the energy market stems from its groundbreaking use of the Internet to make buying electricity as easy as ordering a book online You just point click and spend Its easier than Amazon said Steve Lewis a power marketer with City Light demonstrating the companys Web site It lists available power products and the asking price for both buyers and sellers Lewis and other power marketers monitor City Lights projected power needs and then use the phone or Internet to schedule electricity for the next hour next day or months ahead They try to find the best price available but its clearly a sellers market Utilities routinely buy power that used to cost per megawatt hour for more than At times last month City Light was buying power for a megawatt hour And its not because the cost of generation has gone up This is pure profit said Green deputy superintendent of City Light There is evidence that the Northwest is in some ways being hit even harder than California whose experiment with deregulation is blamed for roiling the power markets A recent analysis found that Pacific Northwest utilities are paying the highest prices in the nation for the nextday delivery of wholesale power However regional utilities also sell power for extraordinarily high prices In fact some of the highest average prices paid by City Light last month were to neighbors Puget Sound Energy Western Washingtons largest electric utility charged City Light the highest average price of any seller last month at per megawatt hour according to City Lights preliminary billing estimates Spokanes Avista Energy charged That compares with Enrons average price of per megawatt hour and an overall average of The BPA by comparison charges City Light per megawatt hour City Light typically relies on local utilities more when it needs power delivered immediately And prices for shortterm deals can be higher depending on the time of day The city has only a longterm contract with the BPA D espite the recordsetting month city officials hope theyll be in better shape before the year is out Mayor Paul Schell has taken to calling Oct Seattles energy independence day because thats when the city will begin receiving more hydroelectric power under a new contract with the BPA The historically cheap BPA power combined with a contract with a gasfired power plant in Klamath Falls Ore should reduce the citys reliance on the open market city officials say But the BPA too has been stricken by higher market power costs and may have to increase its rates to City Light by percent The City Council has already agreed to pass those higher costs on to Seattle ratepayers although its unclear how much that would raise the bill of the average person Even at a higher rate City Light officials regard the BPA power as a good longterm strategy for getting power costs under control If they succeed the rate increases approved this year could eventually be rescinded Until then local ratepayers will have to keep writing bigger checks to City Light with the knowledge that some of their money will find its way to Texas To see more of The Seattle Times or to subscribe to the newspaper go to

up the street says for all the help with the naval history It gets to swirling around from time to time Nelson Jacks great idol smote the hated Spanish and French at Trafalgar in the th century long after the Armada had been wrecked at the mouth of the Thames an event that Shakespeare must have been aware of I am working through Spanish history by reading a book by the art critic Robert Hughes about Barcelona and did not realize the unique maritime power of that City At one time it dominated the Mediterranean in its time of glory which was back in the Middle Ages I want to say in the or hundreds They have an outstanding Maritime Museum containing examples of those wierd sounding boats like xebecs and lateens and the prize I want to see is the big ship that some Austrian hero sailed at the famous battle of Lepanto which battle is referred to by Cervantes in Don Quixote as the time when Christianity dealt the hated Turks a heavy blow Cervantes was wounded in the battle and languished in a Turkish prison in north Africa some of which comes out in his immortal tale I will not be near Trafalgar because we are going to go from Madrid to Granada to Barcelona in a triangle but will at some point be able to gaze out across the Mediterranean in the direction of some of those little islands that OBrien mentions I think one of them is called Minorca and there is a Belarazic or something like that And we will see some of the Pyrennes sp where Stephen had his family castle and through which he dragged Jack in that bear costume which always amuses me so much to recall If you could obtain from Ted Murphy and send me the current Risk Management Policy I would be forever grateful I like to go back to the text from time to time cgy To Christian CT cc Subject Re Trading Limits Christian Im afraid you may have your centuries confused relative to Nelson and the Armada The Spanish Armada of fame was a fleet dispatched by Philip II of Spain to invade England in the late th century it was during Elizabeth Is reign and I have some vague recollection that Mary Queen of Scots had something to do with encouraging Philip before she was executed The Armada was defeated in a series of battles and by some very bad weather around the English Channel Nelson didnt sail til the th century Of course the English and the Spanish had been going at it off and on the entire time and youd have to say on in the early s when Nelson broke the enemy line at the battle of Trafalgar I believe that was during a time when the Spanish were allies of Napoleon whether by choice or under duress I couldnt say and the enemy fleet was a combined FrenchSpanish fleet The battle is named after Cape Trafalgar in southern Spain Im pretty sure its somewhere between Cadiz and Gibraltar so your gut feeling is right I dont see it on the map either wonder if it has a different name in Spanish Will you be going to that part of SpainAndalusia The English victory has in common with the Armada battle of a bit over years earlier that it ended any hopes held by the enemy of imminent invasion of Britain As far as the policy question goes you are remembering what I always referred to as the trading policy but is officially referred to as the Risk Management Policy It most definitely covers Portland trading operations I havent been as involved in that policy for the last couple of years as I was back when MEH was chief control officer Ted Murphy now has responsibility for maintaining and enforcing the policy I dont have a current version but will ask Ted for one Mark Christian Yoder

War of Spanish Succession the Spanish Inquisition and of course the Spanish Aramada I have never read a definitive account of that great moment in English naval history Did Nelson fight in the Armada battle at Trafalgar Is that the battle Jack Aubrey is always talking about Where the hell is Trafalgar I have the idea it is down there by Gibraltar but cant find it on the map On the other hand I have a vague fantasy of these little row boats coming out at the mouth of the Thames to battle the mighty Armada When one considers what the panic must have been like in the Spanish fleet when they realized that in spite of their size and assumed invincibility they were actually vulnerable to that old maritime risk of sinking one is involuntarily caused to cast ones badly jaundiced

warming up to it slowly Not sure I want to know a lot about the guy not because it isnt interesting but because I feel I already know more about him than I can really handle even if that quantity is but a small part of the best of what he was the size of that part being directly proportional to my ability to plumb the depths of what he was writing This whole notion of a remarkable turning point a place where a guy just looks at his sordid past and say it didnt happen I am somebody else is fascinating I wonder if that is what happened to the old Apostle Paul when he was struck by that light and just got up and took off in a completely different way I have struggled in perhaps an analagous way with making sense of how I have ended up toiling in a giant Casino What the hell is a Mennonite farm boy drop out doing working at the very core of the economy which all of his history has required his people to remain on the very fringes of I find myself telling myself that when I enter the doors to the Casino in the morning I am another person Clyde Durham itinerant journeyman energy attorney Thinking of myself in the third person really helps OBrian interests me biographically for this reason He didnt like his first run at life as Mr Russ and so he just created a different one for himself through his art Mr Obrian All of this fascinates one enormously Ill probably start my second run through his books before too long How are you doing within the nautical analogy lately Thanks again for sharing the article cgy From Mark Taylor on PM CDT To Christian CT cc Subject OBrian article I found this on a sailing magazine web page An acquaintance who is a professor of literature at Stanford brought Patrick OBrian to my attention claiming him to be the finest living author writing in the English language Being an avid reader who had consumed about everything including of course all of Forsters Hornblower books I had my doubts But after an increasingly mesmerizing reading of all of the sixteen OBrian AubreyMaturin novels then in print with ever mounting captivation and awe I wholeheartedly concurred After a second reading of the entire series which revealed to me previously undiscovered depths and glories I felt compelled to pay down the debt I owed this author for the wonderful lifeenriching experience he had given me Since OBrian obviously loved the sea it occurred to me to write offering him a fortnights cruse aboard my Perini ketch the foot Andromeda la Dea for himself and his friends without any interfering presence from myself I asked Danielle Steel if she thought OBrian would be offended by receiving such a letter and her interesting reply was I get about letters per year from readers and I have yet to receive a single one offering to do anything for me he will be delighted even if age and circumstances prevent him from accepting So I wrote via his publisher having literally no idea where in the world he lived and after some forwarding delay I received his handwritten reply in his fine and precise penmanship saying I accept your kind offer with perhaps obscene haste As Mr OBrian was to give a lecture tour of the United States in early that included San Francisco I invited him to dinner the week of his visit and I first saw him in person when I attended his lecture in Herbst Hall His host was the poet laureate of America Robert Haas I was both charmed and alarmed when introduced to OBrians lightening quick wit and rather acerbic manner The following evening he and his wife Mary came to my house in Belvedere for a literary dinner with admirers and one or two other authors Mr OBrian was utterly charming if perhaps a little aloof He took tremendous interest in an Admiralty Board dockyard model I have of an English First Rater of He understood everything about that ship and greatly augmented my own knowledge After the other guests departed we settled into a series of brandies by the fire and I discovered his capacity for serious drinking greatly exceeded my own his reserve only eased very slightly in the presence of this unknown American me and his knowledge of the practical aspects of sailing seemed amazingly almost nil After a half liter of cognac had vanished and we were still calling each other Mr OBrian and Mr Perkins I produced a chart of the Mediterranean and we began to discuss the agenda for his cruise I had learned that the OBrians home was in Collioure a village on the Mediterranean coast of France just north of the Spanish border in Basque country The harbor of Port Vendres lies nearby where Andromeda could pick all of them up OBrian then suggested a cruise circumnavigating Sicily a stop in Greece dropping by Beirut and winding up with a comprehensive tour of the Balearic islands I was stunned How I wondered could this old salt possibly comprehend a tour of over nautical miles with numerous port calls in only days in a yacht capable of only about knots As I began to explain the physical limitations of time and space he added a desire to drop the hook in Naples Capri and Tangiers as well While I could not reconcile this plan with reality I assumed it was the wine in control and then I was both startled and pleased when he added at the evenings end that he had a major nonnegotiable condition to accepting my offer namely that I personally would join him Mary and their guests aboard my yacht In May as the departure date appoached I had a rough time getting Andromeda to the tiny and picturesque Port Vendres in time to pick them up Every time I have been in the Gulf of Lions I have been pasted and this was one of the worst Andromeda broke her inner forestay and lost all telecommunication as well but after a real dusting we made it and OBrian and Mary showed me around the village and offered a lunch at their modest and charming home He took tremendous pride in his wine made from his own grapes pressed and fermented in barrels in his cellar I was fascinated by his office where the books were written It was lined floor to ceiling with reference works on an array of subjects botany geography zoology medicine etc in several languages but not a single volume dated later than He was literally immersed in the period of his work The following morning we were joined by his close friend the scholar and foremost authority on Peeps Richard Ollard his publisher Stuart Proffit and his agent Vivien Green We finalized our itinerary with the decision to visit all the Balearic islands and OBrian somewhat wistfully asked if an additional stop in Istanbul would not be possible Told it was not he boarded radiating the impression that I was something of an Indian giver shortchanging him on his yachting holiday Underway to Menorca beneath a sunny sky with a twenty knot following wind the sailing was marvelous and OBrian was delighted I introduced him to the helm but he seemed to have no feeling for the wind and the course and frequently I had to intervene to prevent a full standing gybe I began to suspect that his autobiographical references to his months at sea as a youth were fanciful He had no idea of the limitations of even a big yacht like Andromeda in terms of the handling and actual distance we could cover in a day However he and Mary adapted quickly to the yacht with no trace of seasickness Mary quiet kind interesting and interested was wonderful to have aboard However she was very frail They were both nearly and I constantly feared she would take a tumble with the ships motion but thankfully this never occurred Before dinner OBrian asked me if I was familiar with an American drink called the martini and he tested my composition of two such killers with relish All the conversations at the table were spirited and he was the center of the talk and controlled its direction totally I found the level of sophistication and erudition of these people to be greater than any I had ever experienced and when they turned to literary or historical contexts I was left far behind My MIT engineers degree had alas not prepared me for cultivated discourse at such a level It was literally exhausting but a marvel to follow The weather continued to be fine and the next morning we were off Menorca OBrian suggested that we sail sail not motor into the long narrow channel leading to the port of Mahon the location of the first meeting between Aubrey and Maturin This was pretty tricky for a boat of Andromedas size but I carried it off happily without mishap We had an interesting afternoon ashore with OBrian showing us about the old city with intense enthusiasm while also demonstrating his fluency in Catalan the local tongue That evening while at dinner back aboard the yacht he suggested for the first time that I call him Patrick and he would use Tom for me And so our cruise continued with Patrick showing keen interest in everything we fished with some success we sailed every day we visited the port of Ciudadela on Menorca and we sailed past the majestic Cape Formentor on the northeast tip of Mallorca where Patrick was entranced by the thousands of sea birds Ornithology was his true passion as it was for his character Stephen Maturin who is clearly modeled on Patricks physique and personality One evening there was an extremely heated discussion around the table which led to hurt feelings requiring overnight to heal It started with Patrick asking me if I had heard of a place Indiana and a school the University of Indiana and did I think the school financially responsible The Universitys English department had purchased and not yet paid for two or three of Patricks manuscripts and had a professor offering a course on OBrian which Patrick found intensely offensive Patrick then mentioned that he was destroying all of his diaries his journals and all of his correspondence so that no trace of his existence would remain save his novels Richard Ollard was aghast and Ms Green was very upset with this quite startling revelation Ollard said that it was a crime against the future and reminded Patrick that he himself had relied heavily on Pablo Picassos letters when he had written a wellreceived biography of the artist Patrick heatedly countered that Picasso had trusted him but that he Patrick could not rely upon the goodwill of some postdoctoral American fool So the tensionfilled discussion continued The analogy of an artist framing his painting was raised it was then complete and should not require either the support nor deserve the distraction of knowing the artists frame of mind at the time of creation Now after Patricks death we understand some of his thinking He was his own construct born Patrick Russ English not Irish not university educated not a sailor a father who abandoned his family and altogether a piece of his own fiction But that night aboard Andromeda only Mary knew the truth and understood his deep motives The following day the unpleasantness passed with more superb sailing in fine Mediterranean weather While under full sail with the huge MPS drawing in light wind with our centerboard keel raised and guided by as it turned out an inaccurate Spanish chart we decided to sail between the coast and a small island and we ran firmly aground in shallow water In the Med one cant simply wait for a higher tide so we emptied all our fresh water tanks and tried to back off No luck I blew out the water in our centerboard trunk with compressed air over ten tons Still no luck Finally we tied a long hawser to a rock astern and using our anchor windlass to bartight tension we slowly worked our way off waggling to and fro with our bow thruster Patrick was delighted with all these nautical operations He nearly believed I thought that we had arranged the event for his entertainment One morning at breakfast after our friendship had become more firmly established Patrick said Tom I wish to ask you an embarrassing question which will reveal my utter and total ignorance of all things in this modern world What is software My answer The piano is the hardware and the sheet music is the software satisfied him and upon reflection myself as well Every afternoon between two and five Patrick retired to my onboard office to work on his novel The Yellow Admiral then in progress He borrowed the yachts charts of France particularly the area around Brest to incorporate detail of the blockade of Brest which is featured in that book Very much to Marys surprise he showed me each days progress She said that he had never shared his work with anyone before completion Later Patrick sent me the original manuscript for this volume which I still keep aboard and which I treasure Thus we cruised for ten days arriving in Palma where the demands of business required that all of Patricks guests and I depart He and Mary continued on to Ibiza with the yachts crew for three further days mostly to study that islands renowned bird colonies Then they sailed uneventfully back to Port Vendres My friendship with Patrick continued until his death in January of this year We corresponded He and Mary stayed in my home They were aboard my schooner Mariette We

Western Power Market Stands Poised on the Precipice According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting Groups Bulk Power Outlook FAIRFAX Va June PRNewswire Power markets in the Western System Coordinating Council are poised on the precipice of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer and next according to a new study of the regional market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group The West stands at least a one in three chance of experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during the summer of said Judah Rose a Senior Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study ICFs analysis of the West points to a number of key nearterm implications Regional Capacity Deficits The region is in a delicate supplydemand balance with most subregions of the West relying on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet nearterm peak capacity requirements Because demand growth is outpacing new supply additions those deficits will only become more extreme over the next two years Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence A fifth consecutive year of aboveaverage hydroelectric generation the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus will again mask the Wests precarious supplydemand balance in However if the drought conditions of the early s resurface the West will find itself at an even greater risk of price spikes Upward Pressure on Prices Prices are on an upward trend for and the result of both higher regional spot natural gas prices and the increasing value of pure capacity the value of ensuring reliability for consumers The study also evaluates the longterm future of the Western market and highlights the following key results Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily The regions underlying demand growth is strong creating a longterm regional capacity need totaling more than MW by unless there is a serious economic downturn in the region Energy Prices Trending Downward The trend for longterm energy prices is for negative real growth through but the region will remain susceptible to nearterm volatility while market institutions continue to evolve and new supply is slowly added over the next few years Capacity Prices Rising Slowly Current low capacity values will continue to rise but still remain below many other regions as new more efficient generation is added Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices Gas demand for power generation is poised to more than double by with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest subregions Even so the West regions vast gas supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little if any real price appreciation through The Western US Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook along with the other five

warming up to it slowly Not sure I want to know a lot about the guy not because it isnt interesting but because I feel I already know more about him than I can really handle even if that quantity is but a small part of the best of what he was the size of that part being directly proportional to my ability to plumb the depths of what he was writing This whole notion of a remarkable turning point a place where a guy just looks at his sordid past and say it didnt happen I am somebody else is fascinating I wonder if that is what happened to the old Apostle Paul when he was struck by that light and just got up and took off in a completely different way I have struggled in perhaps an analagous way with making sense of how I have ended up toiling in a giant Casino What the hell is a Mennonite farm boy drop out doing working at the very core of the economy which all of his history has required his people to remain on the very fringes of I find myself telling myself that when I enter the doors to the Casino in the morning I am another person Clyde Durham itinerant journeyman energy attorney Thinking of myself in the third person really helps OBrian interests me biographically for this reason He didnt like his first run at life as Mr Russ and so he just created a different one for himself through his art Mr Obrian All of this fascinates one enormously Ill probably start my second run through his books before too long How are you doing within the nautical analogy lately Thanks again for sharing the article cgy From Mark Taylor on PM CDT To Christian CT cc Subject OBrian article I found this on a sailing magazine web page An acquaintance who is a professor of literature at Stanford brought Patrick OBrian to my attention claiming him to be the finest living author writing in the English language Being an avid reader who had consumed about everything including of course all of Forsters Hornblower books I had my doubts But after an increasingly mesmerizing reading of all of the sixteen OBrian AubreyMaturin novels then in print with ever mounting captivation and awe I wholeheartedly concurred After a second reading of the entire series which revealed to me previously undiscovered depths and glories I felt compelled to pay down the debt I owed this author for the wonderful lifeenriching experience he had given me Since OBrian obviously loved the sea it occurred to me to write offering him a fortnights cruse aboard my Perini ketch the foot Andromeda la Dea for himself and his friends without any interfering presence from myself I asked Danielle Steel if she thought OBrian would be offended by receiving such a letter and her interesting reply was I get about letters per year from readers and I have yet to receive a single one offering to do anything for me he will be delighted even if age and circumstances prevent him from accepting So I wrote via his publisher having literally no idea where in the world he lived and after some forwarding delay I received his handwritten reply in his fine and precise penmanship saying I accept your kind offer with perhaps obscene haste As Mr OBrian was to give a lecture tour of the United States in early that included San Francisco I invited him to dinner the week of his visit and I first saw him in person when I attended his lecture in Herbst Hall His host was the poet laureate of America Robert Haas I was both charmed and alarmed when introduced to OBrians lightening quick wit and rather acerbic manner The following evening he and his wife Mary came to my house in Belvedere for a literary dinner with admirers and one or two other authors Mr OBrian was utterly charming if perhaps a little aloof He took tremendous interest in an Admiralty Board dockyard model I have of an English First Rater of He understood everything about that ship and greatly augmented my own knowledge After the other guests departed we settled into a series of brandies by the fire and I discovered his capacity for serious drinking greatly exceeded my own his reserve only eased very slightly in the presence of this unknown American me and his knowledge of the practical aspects of sailing seemed amazingly almost nil After a half liter of cognac had vanished and we were still calling each other Mr OBrian and Mr Perkins I produced a chart of the Mediterranean and we began to discuss the agenda for his cruise I had learned that the OBrians home was in Collioure a village on the Mediterranean coast of France just north of the Spanish border in Basque country The harbor of Port Vendres lies nearby where Andromeda could pick all of them up OBrian then suggested a cruise circumnavigating Sicily a stop in Greece dropping by Beirut and winding up with a comprehensive tour of the Balearic islands I was stunned How I wondered could this old salt possibly comprehend a tour of over nautical miles with numerous port calls in only days in a yacht capable of only about knots As I began to explain the physical limitations of time and space he added a desire to drop the hook in Naples Capri and Tangiers as well While I could not reconcile this plan with reality I assumed it was the wine in control and then I was both startled and pleased when he added at the evenings end that he had a major nonnegotiable condition to accepting my offer namely that I personally would join him Mary and their guests aboard my yacht In May as the departure date appoached I had a rough time getting Andromeda to the tiny and picturesque Port Vendres in time to pick them up Every time I have been in the Gulf of Lions I have been pasted and this was one of the worst Andromeda broke her inner forestay and lost all telecommunication as well but after a real dusting we made it and OBrian and Mary showed me around the village and offered a lunch at their modest and charming home He took tremendous pride in his wine made from his own grapes pressed and fermented in barrels in his cellar I was fascinated by his office where the books were written It was lined floor to ceiling with reference works on an array of subjects botany geography zoology medicine etc in several languages but not a single volume dated later than He was literally immersed in the period of his work The following morning we were joined by his close friend the scholar and foremost authority on Peeps Richard Ollard his publisher Stuart Proffit and his agent Vivien Green We finalized our itinerary with the decision to visit all the Balearic islands and OBrian somewhat wistfully asked if an additional stop in Istanbul would not be possible Told it was not he boarded radiating the impression that I was something of an Indian giver shortchanging him on his yachting holiday Underway to Menorca beneath a sunny sky with a twenty knot following wind the sailing was marvelous and OBrian was delighted I introduced him to the helm but he seemed to have no feeling for the wind and the course and frequently I had to intervene to prevent a full standing gybe I began to suspect that his autobiographical references to his months at sea as a youth were fanciful He had no idea of the limitations of even a big yacht like Andromeda in terms of the handling and actual distance we could cover in a day However he and Mary adapted quickly to the yacht with no trace of seasickness Mary quiet kind interesting and interested was wonderful to have aboard However she was very frail They were both nearly and I constantly feared she would take a tumble with the ships motion but thankfully this never occurred Before dinner OBrian asked me if I was familiar with an American drink called the martini and he tested my composition of two such killers with relish All the conversations at the table were spirited and he was the center of the talk and controlled its direction totally I found the level of sophistication and erudition of these people to be greater than any I had ever experienced and when they turned to literary or historical contexts I was left far behind My MIT engineers degree had alas not prepared me for cultivated discourse at such a level It was literally exhausting but a marvel to follow The weather continued to be fine and the next morning we were off Menorca OBrian suggested that we sail sail not motor into the long narrow channel leading to the port of Mahon the location of the first meeting between Aubrey and Maturin This was pretty tricky for a boat of Andromedas size but I carried it off happily without mishap We had an interesting afternoon ashore with OBrian showing us about the old city with intense enthusiasm while also demonstrating his fluency in Catalan the local tongue That evening while at dinner back aboard the yacht he suggested for the first time that I call him Patrick and he would use Tom for me And so our cruise continued with Patrick showing keen interest in everything we fished with some success we sailed every day we visited the port of Ciudadela on Menorca and we sailed past the majestic Cape Formentor on the northeast tip of Mallorca where Patrick was entranced by the thousands of sea birds Ornithology was his true passion as it was for his character Stephen Maturin who is clearly modeled on Patricks physique and personality One evening there was an extremely heated discussion around the table which led to hurt feelings requiring overnight to heal It started with Patrick asking me if I had heard of a place Indiana and a school the University of Indiana and did I think the school financially responsible The Universitys English department had purchased and not yet paid for two or three of Patricks manuscripts and had a professor offering a course on OBrian which Patrick found intensely offensive Patrick then mentioned that he was destroying all of his diaries his journals and all of his correspondence so that no trace of his existence would remain save his novels Richard Ollard was aghast and Ms Green was very upset with this quite startling revelation Ollard said that it was a crime against the future and reminded Patrick that he himself had relied heavily on Pablo Picassos letters when he had written a wellreceived biography of the artist Patrick heatedly countered that Picasso had trusted him but that he Patrick could not rely upon the goodwill of some postdoctoral American fool So the tensionfilled discussion continued The analogy of an artist framing his painting was raised it was then complete and should not require either the support nor deserve the distraction of knowing the artists frame of mind at the time of creation Now after Patricks death we understand some of his thinking He was his own construct born Patrick Russ English not Irish not university educated not a sailor a father who

event for his entertainment One morning at breakfast after our friendship had become more firmly established Patrick said Tom I wish to ask you an embarrassing question which will reveal my utter and total ignorance of all things in this modern world What is software My answer The piano is the hardware and the sheet music is the software satisfied him and upon reflection myself as well Every afternoon between two and five Patrick retired to my onboard office to work on his novel The Yellow Admiral then in progress He borrowed the yachts charts of France particularly the area around Brest

completion Later Patrick sent me the original manuscript for this volume which I still keep aboard and which I treasure Thus we cruised for ten days arriving in Palma where the demands of business required that all of Patricks guests and I depart He and Mary continued on to Ibiza with the yachts crew for three further days mostly to study that islands renowned bird colonies Then they sailed

Western Power Market Stands Poised on the Precipice According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting Groups Bulk Power Outlook FAIRFAX Va June PRNewswire Power markets in the Western System Coordinating Council are poised on the precipice of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer and next according to a new study of the regional market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group The West stands at least a one in three chance of experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during the summer of said Judah Rose a Senior Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study ICFs analysis of the West points to a number of key nearterm implications Regional Capacity Deficits The region is in a delicate supplydemand balance with most subregions of the West relying on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet nearterm peak capacity requirements Because demand growth is outpacing new supply additions those deficits will only become more extreme over the next two years Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence A fifth consecutive year of aboveaverage hydroelectric generation the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus will again mask the Wests precarious supplydemand balance in However if the drought conditions of the early s resurface the West will find itself at an even greater risk of price spikes Upward Pressure on Prices Prices are on an upward trend for and the result of both higher regional spot natural gas prices and the increasing value of pure capacity the value of ensuring reliability for consumers The study also evaluates the longterm future of the Western market and highlights the following key results Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily The regions underlying demand growth is strong creating a longterm regional capacity need totaling more than MW by unless there is a serious economic downturn in the region Energy Prices Trending Downward The trend for longterm energy prices is for negative real growth through but the region will remain susceptible to nearterm volatility while market institutions continue to evolve and new supply is slowly added over the next few years Capacity Prices Rising Slowly Current low capacity values will continue to rise but still remain below many other regions as new more efficient generation is added Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices Gas demand for power generation is poised to more than double by with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest subregions Even so the West regions vast gas supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little if any real price appreciation through The Western US Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook along with the other five

the street says for all the help with the naval history It gets to swirling around from time to time Nelson Jacks great idol smote the hated Spanish and French at Trafalgar in the th century long after the Armada had been wrecked at the mouth of the Thames an event that Shakespeare must have been aware of I am working through Spanish history by reading a book by the art critic Robert Hughes about Barcelona and did not realize the unique maritime power of that City At one time it dominated the Mediterranean in its time of glory which was back in the Middle Ages I want to say in the or hundreds They have an outstanding Maritime Museum containing examples of those wierd sounding boats like xebecs and lateens and the prize I want to see is the big ship that some Austrian hero sailed at the famous battle of Lepanto which battle is referred to by Cervantes in Don Quixote as the time when Christianity dealt the hated Turks a heavy blow Cervantes was wounded in the battle and languished in a Turkish prison in north Africa some of which comes out in his immortal tale I will not be near Trafalgar because we are going to go from Madrid to Granada to Barcelona in a triangle but will at some point be able to gaze out across the Mediterranean in the direction of some of those little islands that OBrien mentions I think one of them is called Minorca and there is a Belarazic or something like that And we will see some of the Pyrennes sp where Stephen had his family castle and through which he dragged Jack in that bear costume which always amuses me so much to recall If you could obtain from Ted Murphy and send me the current Risk Management Policy I would be forever grateful I like to go back to the text from time to time cgy To Christian CT cc Subject Re Trading Limits Christian Im afraid you may have your centuries confused relative to Nelson and the Armada The Spanish Armada of fame was a fleet dispatched by Philip II of Spain to invade England in the late th century it was during Elizabeth Is reign and I have some vague recollection that Mary Queen of Scots had something to do with encouraging Philip before she was executed The Armada was defeated in a series of battles and by some very bad weather around the English Channel Nelson didnt sail til the th century Of course the English and the Spanish had been going at it off and on the entire time and youd have to say on in the early s when Nelson broke the enemy line at the battle of Trafalgar I believe that was during a time when the Spanish were allies of Napoleon whether by choice or under duress I couldnt say and the enemy fleet was a combined FrenchSpanish fleet The battle is named after Cape Trafalgar in southern Spain Im pretty sure its somewhere between Cadiz and Gibraltar so your gut feeling is right I dont see it on the map either wonder if it has a different name in Spanish Will you be going to that part of SpainAndalusia The English victory has in common with the Armada battle of a bit over years earlier that it ended any hopes held by the enemy of imminent invasion of Britain As far as the policy question goes you are remembering what I always referred to as the trading policy but is officially referred to as the Risk Management Policy It most definitely covers Portland trading operations I havent been as involved in that policy for the last couple of years as I was back when MEH was chief control officer Ted Murphy now has responsibility for maintaining and enforcing the policy I dont have a current version but will ask Ted for one Mark Christian Yoder AM To Mark ECT Legal CT cc Elizabeth CT Subject Trading Limits Mark I havent had a chance to plunge into the book you lent me at the conference because I am flailing around wildly in as much as I can about certain Spanish topics before early July including such things as of course Cervantes a man whose mind I have come to love almost as much as Shakespeares the Catalans the Spanish Civil War the War of Spanish Succession the Spanish Inquisition and of course the Spanish Aramada I have never read a definitive account of that great moment in English naval history Did Nelson fight in the Armada battle at Trafalgar Is that the battle Jack Aubrey is always talking about Where the hell is Trafalgar I have the idea it is down there by Gibraltar but cant find it on the map On the other hand I have a vague fantasy of these little row boats coming out at the mouth of the Thames to battle the mighty Armada When one considers what the panic must have been like in the Spanish fleet when they realized that in spite of their size and assumed invincibility they were actually vulnerable to that old maritime risk of sinking one is involuntarily caused to cast ones badly jaundiced commerciallegal mind upon recent events of an analagous nature on board our own beloved ship sailing as it has been in the northern commercial straits Has our mighty Armada sailed out onto the seas of deregulation only to meet the perhaps I shall cease articulating this line of thought and dwell upon the ingenuity of the Engish Anyway I have come to a point here in Portland where I need to go back into the policy context of our trading business I recall in Houston that we had these trading policies that you worked on and that they set limits and articulated responsibilities Do you still have close contact with those policies and if so is there a discrete document that pertains to the Portland desk and if so would you be so kind as to send me a hard copy of it I want to ground myself again
