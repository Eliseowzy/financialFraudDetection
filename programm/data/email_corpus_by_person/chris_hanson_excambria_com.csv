press release concerning Excambrias Margin Maker v product lineup There is a good deal of new product information at wwwexcambriacom Best regards Chris Hanson Chief Operating Officer Excambria Inc Waters Park Drive Suite San Mateo Calif fax mobile Excambria Ships Margin Maker v Travel Distribution Profitability Product Suite Integrates Internet GDS on Travel Professionals Desktop Cuts Distribution Costs for Suppliers San Mateo CAJanuary Excambria Inc the leading provider of applications to integrate legacy and Internet systems for the travel industry today announced the availability of Margin Maker v the industrys new distribution and profitability product suite The patentpending Margin Maker v family of products allows travel agents and corporate travel buyers to simultaneously access content through the legacy global distribution systems GDS such as Sabre and through the Internet where travel suppliers are increasingly putting content that is not in the GDS While the travel professional continues to work in his native GDS environment Margin Maker v technology translates the GDS commands into Internet protocol and searches websites and other TCPIPconnected data sources The technology allows the travel professional to view on a single screen with a single GDS command content from the GDS the Internet and thirdparty databases The inventory and fares are displayed side by side on a single screen allowing travel professionals to select the inventory and price that create the maximum value for their clients and themselves Travel professionals were constantly being blindsided by customers who had seen cheap fares on the Web said Excambria CEO Vajid Jafri The travel professionals work environment is GDScentric and workflow is so tightly bound to their legacy global distribution system that inventory available on the Internet remained largely inaccessible to them Margin Maker v products solve this problem by seamlessly integrating Internet inventory and resulting transactions into agency and corporate travel workflow with no additional commands or separate searches required by users Travel agency owners report that a solution such as Margin Maker v had been the highest priority request from their reservation agents during the last twelve months Yet GDSs are not eager to field such a technology fearing it will divert transactions from their own systems Travel suppliers have welcomed Margin Maker v products as a way to place their products onto the travel professionals desktop without high GDS distribution costs An estimated of all travel sales occur on these desktops Supports New Merchant Model Travel agency owners also appreciate Margin Maker v features that allow them to seamlessly mark up lowcost Internet and netbasis fares Many of the fares are so low that our agents can add a markup at time of sale and its not visible to the customer said one agency owner who has used Margin Maker v in prerelease We continue to add our regular service fee separately but the real money is in those margins that we add This technology allowed us to make the transition to merchant and not a commissioned agent Availability Pricing and Service Margin Maker v Agency Profitability Tool is available now through Excambrias network of nationwide resellers as well as direct from the company on a fiveyear
