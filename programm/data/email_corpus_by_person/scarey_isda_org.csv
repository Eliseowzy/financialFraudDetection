SingleStock Futures Offer The Promise of Fat Profits Wall Street Journal Goldman Sachs Names Japan CoPresidents Asian Wall Street Journal Gary Schieneman Named to FASB BNA Japan Must Speed Up Power Sector Deregulation to Lower Rates Dow Jones Newswires May By Maki Aoto TOKYO Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market in order to bring down the countrys high power rates while ensuring stable power supply experts said at an industry seminar Tuesday The pressure is mounting for Japans power utilities which have long enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago to become cost effective and performanceconscious after the government partially liberalized the retail power market in March However the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to conventional power companies What happened in overseas power industries suggest that the liberalization in Japan wouldnt only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable power supply significantly said Tatsuo Hatta professor of economics at the University of Tokyo Compared with the US Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as much for households and three times higher for industrial users There is a large discrepancy in rates and that is why we should hurriedly implement the liberalization Hatta said He said Japans steep seasonal peakload curve one of the reasons the power companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan can be altered once the prices are liberalized If power rates are set higher during those peak hours following the liberalization users would refrain from using electricity Steven Kean executive vice president of the US energy major Enron Corp ENE told the same seminar that Japans power costs remain on the upward trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the US He said Japan could achieve a costsaving of Y trillion a year if its power prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries following the liberalization Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called Reassessing Power Deregulation which was cosponsored by the Houstonbased Enron Hatta of the University of Tokyo said its very wise that Japan has begun the deregulation with the bilateral supply or trade system under which suppliers and users clinch deals directly Under the current reforms the sector for highvolume largelot industrial and commercial users which represents only of the Y trillion market is opened to free competition The government is to review the partial deregulation by for further deregulation Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power providers Hatta said Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation should destroy the systems that have supported the countrys high power rates regional monopolies and the fair rate return method under which all costs are levied on prices There is absolutely no need to set the same power prices nationwide Hatta said Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand he said Yoshinori Omuro vice president of Takashimaya Cos JTKA or management department acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation Takashimaya a major department store operator has shifted to Diamond Power Corp a whollyowned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp JMIB or as its power supplier at two of its stores with strong backup from the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry Despite the deregulation the situation isnt where we can negotiate with power utilities to reduce electricity costs We have no choice but select independent power providers Omuro said SingleStock Futures Offer The Promise of Fat Profits The Wall Street Journal May By Peter A Mckay and Kopin Tan The concept of singlestock futures which most US financial exchanges hope will be a cash cow already has done the nearimpossible It got the major Chicago exchanges to agree on something Monday Chicagos three major futures and options exchanges said they will jointly form a market for singlestock futures a type of contract already available in Europe that was recently approved by US regulators These hybrid investing vehicles resemble stock options but allow investors to do more including having more freedom in betting against a stock The venture announced Monday represents a rare instance of cooperation among usually heated local rivals the Chicago Board Options Exchange Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade The CBOE and CME each will have a stake in the new online exchange while the Board of Trade will have a share market executives said The Chicago exchange chiefs said their joint venture will be running by August when federal regulators are due to hammer out their final rules for firms to trade singlestock futures Individual investors will get access to them by December under a separate set of standards The competition among exchanges is expected to be fierce since the new futures have unique crossover appeal among options stock and futures markets that rarely compete for the same products Indeed Mondays announcement was considered just another in a string of several to come as markets try to tap into one anothers expertise to beat other competitors From talking to our customers they told us they wanted to use singlestock futures to hedge their options positions said Chicago Mercantile Exchange Chairman Scott Gordon Once we heard that it was pretty clear we should talk to CBOE The Nasdaq Stock Market and the London International Financial Futures Options Exchange previously announced a similar deal Singlestock futures will be contracts pegged to a companys shares settled at a predetermined delivery date either by cash or delivery of shares That makes them different from options which have been used since the s and convey the right but not the obligation to buy or sell stock In the Chicago deal the Board of Trade was brought in toward the end of the other two partners initial talks Officials from all sides acknowledged the first two exchanges had the most natural alliance because of the CBOEs expertise listing options pegged to individual stocks and the CMEs success in offering stockindex futures particularly those pegged to Standard Poors indexes The asyetunnamed joint venture will be a forprofit company with its own management and board and will be structured separately as a regulated exchange Its singlestock futures will be traded electronically with orders entered through both CBOEDirect a screenbased trading platform the CBOE is preparing to launch later this year and the CMEs Globex electronictrading system Dave Vitale chief executive officer of the Board of Trade said his exchange also will try to persuade Eurex a giant GermanSwiss derivatives market with which CBOT has an online alliance to list the singlestock futures on that platform A CBOT spokesman said the exchange recently contacted Eurex about the new joint venture but hadnt received a response It also remains to be seen whether the new exchanges futures will be fungible a securitiesindustry term referring to the common settlement of securities or the ability for investors to open positions at one market and close them at another Fungibility usually isnt a factor in the futures business and any decision to launch a nonfungible product will be an intriguing litmus test as other exchanges prepare to trade singlestock futures William Brodsky chairman of the CBOE said the exchanges are still ironing out details of the proposed product including fungibility While the law doesnt require singlestock futures to be fungible and the Securities and Exchange Commission has indicated it wont force fungibility on exchanges other hurdles remain Among them whether Options Clearing Corp which clears options contracts and is owned jointly by the five major US option exchanges will honor nonfungible contracts exclusive to one of the exchanges If the new exchange opts to make the futures nonfungible the ability to trade easily will be a concern among investors and customers said partners at several optiontrading firms Goldman Sachs Names Japan CoPresidents The Asian Wall Street Journal May Goldman Sachs Group Inc promoted its head of Japanese investment banking and its Asian fixedincome chief to be copresidents of the firms Tokyo operations Masanori Mochida years old who runs the investment banking division in Japan and Thomas Montag years old who heads the Asian fixed income currency and

be rare A chief element in the rationale for use of such accounting is the inability to find an acquirera situation on which some in accounting including IASB member James Leisenring and former SEC Chief Accountant Michael Sutton have cast serious doubt If poolings are not used the purchase method of accounting is the general rule around the world Purchase accounting typically includes writedown of goodwill an amount that represents the premium paid over the book value of net purchased assets In Connecticut FASB has completed work on a set of rules for business combinations accounting built on required use of the purchase method DTR G Poolingsprominent accounting practice in the United Stateswould be banned after June according to FASBs latest set of decisions in the key rulemaking effort However FASB would not allow goodwill amortization under its proposed standard which is expected to be issued in midJuly Instead the US board plans to call for accounting that hinges on tests to gauge whether goodwill has been impairedmeaning its fair value dips below its book value leading to a writedown of the intangible asset only when that occurs Impairment Also Eyed by IASB IASB signaled that goodwill impairment might be the way to go as Tweedie stated in providing a summary of preliminary board opinions expressed on the second day of its fourday meeting in London However a number of board members are not ready to rule out goodwill amortization as shown by comments that were noted by their chairman Accounting standards on combinations could be better aligned around the world but that does not mean IASB would achieve such convergence by just slavishly following world opinion Tweedie said The international board plans to study the issue and accounting options thoroughly before it settles on a proposed route for merger and acquisition accounting The research is expected to include a close reading of FASB documents chronicling that boards odyssey toward what it calls the impairmentonly approach for goodwill As noted by FASB members now on IASB the US board went down that path because it tries wherever possible to avoid affording choices in accounting The impairmentonly method is favored by many in commerce because it prevents the drag on earnings presented by the automatic writedown of goodwill Tweedie Offers Project Proposals Other topics that Tweedie suggested should be in the scope of IASBs preliminary study leading to a rulemaking project on combinations are joint ventures which Tweedie called a big escape route around the negative effects of the purchase method for combinations and goodwill amortization dual listings of stock of otherwise joined enterprises said to be another method of accounting avoidance and acquisition provisioning a practice in the United Kingdom In Britain where Tweedie headed the Accounting Standards Board in the s and into the impairment test for goodwill in combinations is stronger than the mechanism planned by FASB the IASB chairman said However as Tweedie and an IASB colleague Warren McGregor noted the economy largely has been strong over the last several years Thus the impairment approach hasnt undergone a stress test to see how well it works as McGregor said Experience With Projects Concerns At FASB Leisenring now on IASB helped decide the direction of the combinations project until he left the board in June However he did not take part in the redeliberations on treatment of goodwill he emphasized In comments May Leisenring appeared somewhat optimistic about the utility of the goodwill impairment testand was more upbeat about the better quality of financial reporting resulting from a ban on poolings He also predicted the new FASB standard would lead to better recognition of intangible assets I think you wont just see these impairments exist when they want to have them he said adding that the reporting would be marketdriven He noted FASBs reasoning that getting rid of poolings would require that the purchase price be put on the books making financial statements more useful to investors Across the table from Leisenring Geoffrey Whittington a professor of accounting at Cambridge University until summer suggested that a loose impairment test could lead to nonamortization where such a writedown due to a slide in value was in order He also appeared to question whether an acquirer could be found in every combination as Leisenring had asserted IASB plans to continue to discuss business combinations at upcoming board meetings this summer Banks attack investment risk accounting plan Financial Times May By Michael Peel Leading banks will on Thursday attack a radical international plan to make companies reveal more about the risks associated with their investment portfolios A conference at the British Bankers Association the main industry body will highlight concerns that the plan could cause volatility in profits and threaten investor confidence The vast majority of banks think these proposals are potentially very damaging said Paul Chisnall a BBA director There is no split in the industry on this The comments highlight the controversy over fair value accounting a new approach that forces companies to adjust their profits to take account of the economic effects of nontrading activities The BBA has joined other banks across Europe in condemning a plan unveiled late last year by the Joint Working Group a body made up mainly of accounting standardsetters from the worlds biggest economies The proposals which are being considered by national standardsetting bodies and the European Commission will make companies adjust earnings to take account of rises and falls in the values of financial instruments such as derivatives and loans to customers The BBA conference includes contributions from the chief accountants of HSBC BNP Paribas and Barclays Bank none of whom is expected to speak favourably about the proposals The banks say it is unfair to make them account for changes in the values of instruments such as longterm customer loans which are rarely traded and generally held to maturity They are worried that sharp changes in interest rates would lead to dramatic changes in banks accounts and confuse consumers Banks argue the swings could put them at risk of breaching solvency requirements set by regulators forcing them to withdraw from lending that caused volatility even though it was safe The standardsetters who produced the plan say it should help investors by revealing large liabilities that remain concealed under traditional accounting rules Prospects for Quick Resolution of Japans Bad Loan Problem Dim Study Panel Urged BNA May By Toshio Aritake TOKYOWith barely a month left before the Diet parliament adjourns in late June Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumis international pledge to settle the bad loan problem of banks in two years appears to have stalled Minister in Charge of Financial Services Hakuo Yanagisawa May met Takashi Imai chairman of the powerful Keidanren the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan that represents all top Japanese companies Yanagisawa asked for Keidanren cooperation and proposed the establishment of a joint study panel of Keidanren and Zenginkyo the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan to examine early bad loan disposal a Financial Services Agency official said May But Imai demurred only agreeing to the need for prompt action Keidanren officials said May However Keidanren and Zenginkyo May began exploring ways to form the proposed study panel The two organizations are preparing to hold a toplevel meeting during the week of May and will try to work out a joint guideline on debt forgiveness by banks to borrowers by the end of June a Keidanren official said May Yanagisawas policy which he explained during parliamentary testimony earlier this month is to encourage the private sector to voluntarily clean up bad loanswhich the FSA earlier this year said totaled as much as trillion yen about trillionwith market principles and encourage banks to forgive bad loans that may not be recovered so that borrowers including construction companies can continue borrowing In this way the banks would not fail and result in job losses for workers Countering Moral Hazard The socalled moral hazard that may occur as a result of banks giving debt forgiveness to borrowers can be prevented with restrictions under the Civil Rehabilitation Law Yanagisawa said He also said in Diet testimony that the Koizumi Cabinet needs to heed the policies of the Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport and that totally denying debt forgiveness would arbitrarily halt industry restructuring Over the past several years banks had implemented debt forgiveness to beleaguered borrowers such as large construction companies supermarket chains and banks themselves in what FSA officials have termed as the first debt forgiveness program and maintained credit lines or continued extending new loans to the borrowers Yanagisawa said that on the condition that troubled borrowers seek debt forgiveness as the precondition to mergers and acquisitions that the second debt forgiveness program should be accepted While Keidanrens Imai is in agreement with Yanagisawawho seems to represent banks stance more than that of Japanese industry as a wholethat bad loan cleanup should be left to private sector efforts his reluctance to accept Yanagisawas request stems from his longheld view that Japan needs to quickly address the problem of excess production capacity the Keidanren official said The United States and the European Union supports Imais position Imai as well as Japan Employers Association Chairman Hiroshi Okuda also are concerned that debt forgiveness might resuscitate the borrowers and make them stronger than companies that have diligently managed their businesses and as a result the good companies might in turn be put in jeopardy Banking Industry Skeptical Even the banking industry is skeptical of Yanagisawas scheme One senior official of a top Japanese bank expressed concern that Yanagisawas emphasis on privatesector efforts might lead to a succession of something comparable to the multibilliondollar failures of the Sogo retail group and Tokyo Life Insurance last year Both companies failed last year after suffering the implosion of huge liabilities relative to capital and assetsdespite banks loan restructuring and debt forgiveness The FSA put Sogo under government supervised corporate rehabilitation Debt forgiveness may not necessarily contribute to restoring health to troubled borrowers if their stock prices remain low and earnings remain poor as happened to many borrowers in the past That could mean that if the second debt forgiveness did not work then another debt forgiveness would become necessary starting a vicious cycle Analysts Not Impressed David Asher the American Enterprise Institutes associate director of Asian studies described such an approach at an April seminar in Tokyo as brain dead capital injection to borrowers Keio University professor Masaru Kaneko said May that the whole government approach toward bad loans reflected the ineptness of the Koizumi Cabinet and that he and his key Cabinet members have proved that they are failing to break the Liberal Democratic Partys faction system and the old guard hierarchy If Koizumi truly is determined to resolve the bad loan problem in two years as he pledged in his first parliamentary speech May he should inject taxpayer money and force banks to write down bad loans and punish bankers and borrowers severely Kaneko said Analyzing Yanagisawas Diet testimony Kaneko said the minister is emphasizing private sector efforts and market principles to avoid getting accused publicly In fact at least two regional banks that Yanagisawa nationalized with taxpayer money injections a few years ago had to receive taxpayer money again last year despite his promise to resell the banks back to the market Japanese Online Trading Service Eyes Expansion Financial Times Newsbytes May By Adam Creed EDerivativecom a Japanese online brokerage for trade in interest rates derivatives is looking to expand its customer base in Japan and overseas The online brokerage said on Tuesday it has contracted Radianz a Reuters and Equantowned networking company to provide local and international Internet protocol IP connectivity EDerivativecoms hour realtime market trading platform will be available to yen market dealers via their own local area networks rather than through an existing standalone system The networked service also allows the company to more effectively

Tokyos yen swaps arena a market it values at billion Spokesperson Kimihiko Matsuno told Newsbytes the service currently has just under clients There are about active players at the moment in the Yen market and we intend to target the core banks by the end of this year Matsuno said Nominations to Fed Governor Seats To Be Ready Soon White House Official Says BNA May By Brett Ferguson President Bush is expected to nominate two economists to fill the open seats on the Federal Reserves Board of Governors within the next few weeks Glenn Hubbard chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors told BNA May Hubbard said the security clearance and background checks required for such highlevel positions have slowed the nomination process but filling the last two seats on the sevenmember Board of Governors is a priority for President Bush There has been no specific effort to pick candidates working in the private sector rather than academia but the ideal candidate should be someone with excellent knowledge of banking and financial issues since banking regulation is the majority of what the Fed does Hubbard said Hubbard would not name any specific individuals under consideration for the Board of Governors posts but said there is a list of several names being widely circulated Some of the names being circulated include Terry Jorde president of CountryBank USA in North Dakota Diane Swonk chief economist at Bank One in Chicago and Cynthia Glassman a senior economist at the accounting firm Ernst Young Bankers Eye Impact on Agenda If Senate Control Changes Hands BNA May By Adam Wasch and R Christian Bruce The financial services industry will move to a more defensive position on consumer privacy subprime lending and other issues if Sen James Jeffords RVt bolts from the Republican Party and gives Democrats control of the Senate and its banking committee sources told BNA May But overall key legislative priorities for bankers will remain intact if as expected Sen Paul Sarbanes DMd replaces Sen Phil Gramm RTexas as committee chairman they added A spokesman for Sarbanes declined to comment but Gramm told reporters May that he expects good relations regardless of the committees makeup I expect the same cooperation that the banking committee has operated under for the last two and a half years Gramm said A spokeswoman for Gramm noted that funding for the committees staffs would continue to remain evenly split through the current session of Congress based on a resolution passed earlier this year Dodd as Chairman Presumably if Jeffords switches parties Sarbanes would assume the committees leadership position although one BNA source familiar with the issue said Sen Christopher Dodd DConn also could be in play for the job Either way observers cautioned that it will likely take weeks before a Senate resolution could be crafted to deal with the massive change in committee appointments Nevertheless experts said that if Dodd were appointed it would help to assuage Republicans concerns about the Banking Committee adopting what they said could be a more activist agenda under Sarbanes A Democratic staffer for the House Financial Services Committee predicted that if Sarbanes takes the chair more progress can be expected on consumer protection issues that the staffer said are now being ignored such as predatory lending abuses by credit card issuers and socalled payday lenders I would see an aggressive consumer agenda coming out the staffer said There are a lot of banking issues that tend to be bipartisan an industry representative told BNA There will be no effect on business checking legislation and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reform which are major priorities for us Both are bipartisan Bankruptcy Reform Could Move Another issue that could benefit from a shift in power is bankruptcy reform HR S which passed both houses by a large margin in March However since its passage the bill has remained stalled due to the Republican leaderships inability to agree upon party representation in conference A Democratic Senate clearly would break that logjam and some industry observers see the legislation moving more easily if the Democrats take over in the Senate although abortion and homestead exemption issues could still provide barriers during conference No one interviewed by BNA expected a flood of legislation to move out of a Democratically controlled Senate Democrats would have too narrow a majority and each senators individual power in the legislative process is too great for that For example issues related to regulation of secondary mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will remain as politically complex as ever sources said There is still going to be a very tenuous division of power one source said I dont think people should now expect some big Democratic banking agenda Oxleys Role Could Change Perhaps the most immediate effect of a Democratic takeover in the Senate is the increased pressure it could bring to bear upon House Financial Service Committee Chairman Michael Oxley ROhio Although banking industry representatives stressed to BNA how eager they are to work with members of either party congressional sources told BNA the Republican party is their traditional ally This elevates Oxleys prestige considerably one Republican staffer told BNA Hes who theyll look to with their issues Sources also said the industry will depend on Oxley to stop any unfavorable bills that clear the Senate We have to figure out if hes a good bill stopper and how far hell go before he has to put pressure on the president to veto legislation one lobbyist said However a committee chairman can have an impact even without passing legislation said Joe Belew president of the Consumer Bankers Association If Sarbanes takes control of the Senate Banking Committee he said the senator from Marylandor any other Democrat who ascends to the postwill be able to use the committee to set the agenda by using hearings and other actions to call attention to key issues Every chairman uses the gavel to highlight his own issues Belew said Democratic Ripple Effect A Democratic staffer on the House side said ripple effects could be felt there if Sarbanes becomes chairman Even though Republicans still control the House the staffer said they would have to take Democratic issues and positions more seriously knowing that Senate Democrats might lend support All of a sudden the Democratic minority here becomes more relevant the staffer told BNA For example until a few days ago predatory lending was a nonissue If Sarbanes starts holding hearings on predatory lending its harder to push aside those concerns in the House Jim McLaughlin director of trust affairs for the American Bankers Association said much the same It will change the direction of the chair about degrees he said Agency Nominations Affected Another area that stands to be affected is the nomination process McLaughlin added Currently the Federal Reserve Board has two vacant seats and industry experts have assumed that the White House will move to replace the current leadership at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision Now the administration will have to plan those nominations with an eye toward candidates acceptable to a Democratic chairman McLaughlin said It will probably be a pretty significant issue he said However McLaughlin predicted that Don Powell who has been named to chair the FDIC is likely to be confirmed I wouldnt think hed be in danger Hes a friend of Phil Gramm but hes a banker and hes knowledgeable McLaughlin said Evenly Split Lobbying Lastly there is potentially some sense of the status quo for the banking industry sources said Although the financial services industry is known to give larger campaign dollars to Republicans this does not mean Democrats have been left out in the cold and are estranged from the banking industrys interests We know both of these men an industry lobbyist told BNA Its not like Sen Sarbaness agenda is a mystery to us We can work with anyone we have to The Financial Services Roundtable a prominent trade group that represents some the largest financial services corporations in the country told BNA it is prepared for what political changes may come Weve been pretty balanced in the distribution of our lobbying efforts a Roundtable spokeswoman told BNA Furthermore Its been in the Senate for some time now We feel comfortable on either side Basle rules could hit stability Financial Times May By John Willman The Bank of England on Wednesday warned that the stability of the worlds financial institutions could be undermined by new rules designed to reduce the risk of bank failures David Clementi deputy governor said the new Basle accord linking the amount of capital banks have to hold more closely to the riskiness of their loans could amplify the economic cycle Downturns would be accentuated if bank credit dried up because the increased risk of loan default required banks to hold more regulatory capital Mr Clementi said there was evidence of such consequences during the Asian crisis when leading banks with sensitive riskmeasurement procedures had suddenly enforced loss limits Riskadjusted capital requirements should be based on longterm measures that include the possibility of future economic downturns in assessing credits No one is suggesting that riskinsensitive capital measures are the answer he said Rather we need to ensure that in so far as we can we avoid sudden perceptions of changed risk Speaking at a conference organised by the UK central bank on systemic risk Mr Clementi said that banking crises had become more common Four of the G leading economies had suffered a banking crisis during the last years He warned that attempts to impose stronger banking regulation could be undermined if risk shifted to more lightly regulated financial institutions such as insurers We may find that our new rules are simply arbitraged away for example using credit risk transfers to insurance subsidiaries or asset securitisation sales to thirdparty insurers or credit insurance and derivatives sold by insurers he said Mr Clementi said he would welcome international discussion of whether the trend towards riskbased measures in banking should be mirrored in nonlife insurance regulation French peg their hopes on fiveyear bonds An alternative to futures traded on the Eurex could prove the deciding factor in a longrunning debate Financial Times May By Aline van Duyn The longstanding competition between Germany and France to be the benchmark for the eurozone bond markets is heating up again The latest instalment of the debate is being played out in the futures market where Euronext the European exchange that runs the French derivatives market last week relaunched its fiveyear European bond futures contracts The contracts are being presented as an alternative to the fiveyear futures traded on the SwissGerman Eurex exchange which have come under scrutiny from banks active in the market following a successful squeeze operation in March Although the products traded on the exchanges are not directly related to the debt borrowing programmes of their respective governments the outcome of their jostle for position could affect the price each country has to pay for its bonds Herve Cros bond strategist at BNP Paribas which is one of banks which will act as a market maker for the new Euronext contracts said the squeeze experienced on the Eurex exchange which led to losses for many banks offered an opportunity to try to create an alternative For this reason Euronext decided to relaunch its future on behalf of and in collaboration with numerous international players Mr Cros said When a bond future matures the owner has the right to receive a certain number of underlying government bonds This creates more demand for the underlying debt and can therefore push up its price At the moment French fiveyear bonds yield more than German fiveyear bonds Reducing this gap would benefit the French treasury because it could reduce its cost of borrowing Because the amount of futures traded can be much larger than the size of the underlying cash market shortage of deliverable bonds can occur If an investor secretly buys up the deliverable bonds the conditions for a market squeeze are created because others will need to pay a premium to obtain the debt when the futures expire There is a particular risk of a squeeze when there is a shortage of bonds in the cash market For the June fiveyear bond or Bobl contract traded on Eurex there are more deliverable bonds than for the September contract There are concerns about a possible squeeze in the September Bobl future said Kim Rosenkilde global head of government bonds at ABN Amro which is also a market maker for the Euronext future In the coming weeks traders will start to roll over their positions from June to September The next three weeks will therefore be be a key period for determining the success or otherwise of Euronexts efforts to capture a share of the fiveyear futures market which has been growing in importance in recent years Banks have asked Eurex to consider changing its trading rules to make squeezes less likely but so far the exchanges board has not responded to these demands Euronexts contracts have two elements which could reduce the chance of a squeeze First positions are limited to contracts Second the French treasury is able to temporarily increase the number of bonds available via the repurchase or repo market Mr Rosenkilde said the contract would need to prove itself over the next six to months if it was to become a viable alternative to the Eurex future It can be difficult for liquidity to shift from one exchange to another but it has been done before There are other alternatives to using either the Eurex or Euronext futures although none is likely to take over fully The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange has futures based on fiveyear swaps Traders can also use the swaps market directly or cash government bonds to hedge their debt positions Even though futures markets are a derivative of the underlying market they are particularly important in Europe Despite the existance of the single currency the cash bond markets remain fragmented as each eurozone country issues its own bonds Futures play a more critical role in the European market than they do in the US said Bernd Hoefel head of financial strategies at Lehman Brothers also a market maker for the Euronext future The future is the big unifier for debt market participants and this is why it is so important to have the future functioning smoothly LSE float is another piece in market jigsaw Financial Times May By David Holmes and Braden Reddall LONDON Reuters It may be a giant leap for the London Stock Exchange LSE but its public flotation detailed is no more than a small step on the path towards the unified European equity market that investors desire Having set a July date for its longawaited market debut the London institution was poised on Thursday for one of the most fundamental changes in its year history Yet the flotation is only one part of the stock market jigsaw coming together across Europe as bourses from Amsterdam to Frankfurt list their own shares and change the whole structure of European markets As listed companies exchanges should in theory be more able to make takeovers and alliances to rationalise the complex structure of the markets The LSE pitched its flotation around such a claim that it would shake itself free of the constraints of mutuality and act in a commercial way putting its shareholders interests first It should after all be well placed as the leading European bourse The trillion euro trillion pounds market capitalisation of its listed stocks is nearly double that of either Frankfurt or Paris London is the largest global centre for the management of institutional equities with trillion pounds of equities under management And around foreign companies are listed on the London exchange more than on any other Yet the LSE has still given scant detail of its future strategy beyond some generalisations about being Europes leading exchange and forming unspecified technology links and partnerships CHANGE IN FORTUNES The more important aspect of the LSEs flotation at least in the short term may simply be a pointer to a potential change in its fortunes At the beginning of last year the LSE was a mutually owned organisation struggling against a legacy of internal conflict and strategic uncertainty Subsequently an abortive plan to merge with the Deutsche Boerse led to the departure of Chief Executive Gavin Casey and left an impression of division between the exchange and some of its members Just a few months later the LSE stands poised to secure a near one billion pound flotation that it hopes will return it to the forefront of Europes capital markets It even seems to have gained the support of smaller brokerages with its more conciliatory approach Brian Winterflood chief executive of Winterflood Securities told Reuters Television Isnt it nice to hear everyone on the same side They are listening to people which is marvellous The multibillion pound valuations hung on traditional exchanges show that they have a future despite potential threats to their way of doing business Brokerages have deployed their own systems to trade shares between different clients allowing those clients to trade directly with each other a process known as disintermediation The Internet offers a medium for share trading that could yet emerge as a serious contender yet investors still seem to believe that exchanges have a future Behind the lofty valuations of the LSE and the Deutsche Boerse which runs Frankfurt are hopes that they will ultimately unite to offer investors a seamless route to trading shares across Europe cementing their central market position and their value Hopes that the LSE could itself be a bid target have already helped inflate its shares which are traded on an unofficial matched bargain basis by investment bank Cazenove They rose pence or percent to p by pm having hit a record peak of p almost double their level at last Julys debut But the route to consolidation is little clearer after the LSEs flotation announcement as Chief Executive Clara Furse conceded Flotation gives the LSE an acquisition currency but how it intends to spend it is unclear Trading is going global and geographic boundaries are becoming irrelevant Furse said But how it will all pan out is difficult to predict End of ISDA

SingleStock Futures Offer The Promise of Fat Profits Wall Street Journal Goldman Sachs Names Japan CoPresidents Asian Wall Street Journal Gary Schieneman Named to FASB BNA Japan Must Speed Up Power Sector Deregulation to Lower Rates Dow Jones Newswires May By Maki Aoto TOKYO Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market in order to bring down the countrys high power rates while ensuring stable power supply experts said at an industry seminar Tuesday The pressure is mounting for Japans power utilities which have long enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago to become cost effective and performanceconscious after the government partially liberalized the retail power market in March However the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to conventional power companies What happened in overseas power industries suggest that the liberalization in Japan wouldnt only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable power supply significantly said Tatsuo Hatta professor of economics at the University of Tokyo Compared with the US Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as much for households and three times higher for industrial users There is a large discrepancy in rates and that is why we should hurriedly implement the liberalization Hatta said He said Japans steep seasonal peakload curve one of the reasons the power companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan can be altered once the prices are liberalized If power rates are set higher during those peak hours following the liberalization users would refrain from using electricity Steven Kean executive vice president of the US energy major Enron Corp ENE told the same seminar that Japans power costs remain on the upward trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the US He said Japan could achieve a costsaving of Y trillion a year if its power prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries following the liberalization Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called Reassessing Power Deregulation which was cosponsored by the Houstonbased Enron Hatta of the University of Tokyo said its very wise that Japan has begun the deregulation with the bilateral supply or trade system under which suppliers and users clinch deals directly Under the current reforms the sector for highvolume largelot industrial and commercial users which represents only of the Y trillion market is opened to free competition The government is to review the partial deregulation by for further deregulation Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power providers Hatta said Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation should destroy the systems that have supported the countrys high power rates regional monopolies and the fair rate return method under which all costs are levied on prices There is absolutely no need to set the same power prices nationwide Hatta said Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand he said Yoshinori Omuro vice president of Takashimaya Cos JTKA or management department acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation Takashimaya a major department store operator has shifted to Diamond Power Corp a whollyowned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp JMIB or as its power supplier at two of its stores with strong backup from the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry Despite the deregulation the situation isnt where we can negotiate with power utilities to reduce electricity costs We have no choice but select independent power providers Omuro said SingleStock Futures Offer The Promise of Fat Profits The Wall Street Journal May By Peter A Mckay and Kopin Tan The concept of singlestock futures which most US financial exchanges hope will be a cash cow already has done the nearimpossible It got the major Chicago exchanges to agree on something Monday Chicagos three major futures and options exchanges said they will jointly form a market for singlestock futures a type of contract already available in Europe that was recently approved by US regulators These hybrid investing vehicles resemble stock options but allow investors to do more including having more freedom in betting against a stock The venture announced Monday represents a rare instance of cooperation among usually heated local rivals the Chicago Board Options Exchange Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade The CBOE and CME each will have a stake in the new online exchange while the Board of Trade will have a share market executives said The Chicago exchange chiefs said their joint venture will be running by August when federal regulators are due to hammer out their final rules for firms to trade singlestock futures Individual investors will get access to them by December under a separate set of standards The competition among exchanges is expected to be fierce since the new futures have unique crossover appeal among options stock and futures markets that rarely compete for the same products Indeed Mondays announcement was considered just another in a string of several to come as markets try to tap into one anothers expertise to beat other competitors From talking to our customers they told us they wanted to use singlestock futures to hedge their options positions said Chicago Mercantile Exchange Chairman Scott Gordon Once we heard that it was pretty clear we should talk to CBOE The Nasdaq Stock Market and the London International Financial Futures Options Exchange previously announced a similar deal Singlestock futures will be contracts pegged to a companys shares settled at a predetermined delivery date either by cash or delivery of shares That makes them different from options which have been used since the s and convey the right but not the obligation to buy or sell stock In the Chicago deal the Board of Trade was brought in toward the end of the other two partners initial talks Officials from all sides acknowledged the first two exchanges had the most natural alliance because of the CBOEs expertise listing options pegged to individual stocks and the CMEs success in offering stockindex futures particularly those pegged to Standard Poors indexes The asyetunnamed joint venture will be a forprofit company with its own management and board and will be structured separately as a regulated exchange Its singlestock futures will be traded electronically with orders entered through both CBOEDirect a screenbased trading platform the CBOE is preparing to launch later this year and the CMEs Globex electronictrading system Dave Vitale chief executive officer of the Board of Trade said his exchange also will try to persuade Eurex a giant GermanSwiss derivatives market with which CBOT has an online alliance to list the singlestock futures on that platform A CBOT spokesman said the exchange recently contacted Eurex about the new joint venture but hadnt received a response It also remains to be seen whether the new exchanges futures will be fungible a securitiesindustry term referring to the common settlement of securities or the ability for investors to open positions at one market and close them at another Fungibility usually isnt a factor in the futures business and any decision to launch a nonfungible product will be an intriguing litmus test as other exchanges prepare to trade singlestock futures William Brodsky chairman of the CBOE said the exchanges are still ironing out details of the proposed product including fungibility While the law doesnt require singlestock futures to be fungible and the Securities and Exchange Commission has indicated it wont force fungibility on exchanges other hurdles remain Among them whether Options Clearing Corp which clears options contracts and is owned jointly by the five major US option exchanges will honor nonfungible contracts exclusive to one of the exchanges If the new exchange opts to make the futures nonfungible the ability to trade easily will be a concern among investors and customers said partners at several optiontrading firms Goldman Sachs Names Japan CoPresidents The Asian Wall Street Journal May Goldman Sachs Group Inc promoted its head of Japanese investment banking and its Asian fixedincome chief to be copresidents of the firms Tokyo operations Masanori Mochida years old who runs the investment banking division in Japan and Thomas Montag years old who heads the Asian fixed income currency and

May By Steve Burkholder LONDONThe International Accounting Standards Board took steps May to begin a highpriority rulemaking project on business combinations in hopes of using the effort as one avenue leading to global convergence in financial reporting standards IASB Chairman David Tweedie suggested that the newly restructured board could place the combinations effort fairly high on our priority list of standardsetting and associated projects Formal decisions on the panels agenda await consultation with the board advisory council which is yet to be named DTR G If the board seeks convergence in accounting standards this is one that wed certainly look at Tweedie said of the proposed project on combinations The topic also is expected to be discussed in a special meeting May with the chiefs of national accounting standardsetters from the G countries Edmund Jenkins chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board plans to attend Tentative Approach Would End Poolings A tentative approach in IASBs proposed standardsetting effort would be to end the poolingofinterests method of accounting a method of reporting for true mergers or what are called in the United Kingdom uniting of interests A firm majority of the IASB appeared to favor poolings demise In such unitings the assets of combining enterprises are simply added together leaving no impact on the income statement Such accounting connotes that the commercial marriage is not an acquisition Unitings are allowed under International Accounting Standard on business combinations although their occurrence is understood to be rare A chief element in the rationale for use of such accounting is the inability to find an acquirera situation on which some in accounting including IASB member James Leisenring and former SEC Chief Accountant Michael Sutton have cast serious doubt If poolings are not used the purchase method of accounting is the general rule around the world Purchase accounting typically includes writedown of goodwill an amount that represents the premium paid over the book value of net purchased assets In Connecticut FASB has completed work on a set of rules for business combinations accounting built on required use of the purchase method DTR G Poolingsprominent accounting practice in the United Stateswould be banned after June according to FASBs latest set of decisions in the key rulemaking effort However FASB would not allow goodwill amortization under its proposed standard which is expected to be issued in midJuly Instead the US board plans to call for accounting that hinges on tests to gauge whether goodwill has been impairedmeaning its fair value dips below its book value leading to a writedown of the intangible asset only when that occurs Impairment Also Eyed by IASB IASB signaled that goodwill impairment might be the way to go as Tweedie stated in providing a summary of preliminary board opinions expressed on the second day of its fourday meeting in London However a number of board members are not ready to rule out goodwill amortization as shown by comments that were noted by their chairman Accounting standards on combinations could be better aligned around the world but that does not mean IASB would achieve such convergence by just slavishly following world opinion Tweedie said The international board plans to study the issue and accounting options thoroughly before it settles on a proposed route for merger and acquisition accounting The research is expected to include a close reading of FASB documents chronicling that boards odyssey toward what it calls the impairmentonly approach for goodwill As noted by FASB members now on IASB the US board went down that path because it tries wherever possible to avoid affording choices in accounting The impairmentonly method is favored by many in commerce because it prevents the drag on earnings presented by the automatic writedown of goodwill Tweedie Offers Project Proposals Other topics that Tweedie suggested should be in the scope of IASBs preliminary study leading to a rulemaking project on combinations are joint ventures which Tweedie called a big escape route around the negative effects of the purchase method for combinations and goodwill amortization dual listings of stock of otherwise joined enterprises said to be another method of accounting avoidance and acquisition provisioning a practice in the United Kingdom In Britain where Tweedie headed the Accounting Standards Board in the s and into the impairment test for goodwill in combinations is stronger than the mechanism planned by FASB the IASB chairman said However as Tweedie and an IASB colleague Warren McGregor noted the economy largely has been strong over the last several years Thus the impairment approach hasnt undergone a stress test to see how well it works as McGregor said Experience With Projects Concerns At FASB Leisenring now on IASB helped decide the direction of the combinations project until he left the board in June However he did not take part in the redeliberations on treatment of goodwill he emphasized In comments May Leisenring appeared somewhat optimistic about the utility of the goodwill impairment testand was more upbeat about the better quality of financial reporting resulting from a ban on poolings He also predicted the new FASB standard would lead to better recognition of intangible assets I think you wont just see these impairments exist when they want to have them he said adding that the reporting would be marketdriven He noted FASBs reasoning that getting rid of poolings would require that the purchase price be put on the books making financial statements more useful to investors Across the table from Leisenring Geoffrey Whittington a professor of accounting at Cambridge University until summer suggested that a loose impairment test could lead to nonamortization where such a writedown due to a slide in value was in order He also appeared to question whether an acquirer could be found in every combination as Leisenring had asserted IASB plans to continue to discuss business combinations at upcoming board meetings this summer Banks attack investment risk accounting plan Financial Times May By Michael Peel Leading banks will on Thursday attack a radical international plan to make companies reveal more about the risks associated with their investment portfolios A conference at the British Bankers Association the main industry body will highlight concerns that the plan could cause volatility in profits and threaten investor confidence The vast majority of banks think these proposals are potentially very damaging said Paul Chisnall a BBA director There is no split in the industry on this The comments highlight the controversy over fair value accounting a new approach that forces companies to adjust their profits to take account of the economic effects of nontrading activities The BBA has joined other banks across Europe in condemning a plan unveiled late last year by the Joint Working Group a body made up mainly of accounting standardsetters from the worlds biggest economies The proposals which are being considered by national standardsetting bodies and the European Commission will make companies adjust earnings to take account of rises and falls in the values of financial instruments such as derivatives and loans to customers The BBA conference includes contributions from the chief accountants of HSBC BNP Paribas and Barclays Bank none of whom is expected to speak favourably about the proposals The banks say it is unfair to make them account for changes in the values of instruments such as longterm customer loans which are rarely traded and generally held to maturity They are worried that sharp changes in interest rates would lead to dramatic changes in banks accounts and confuse consumers Banks argue the swings could put them at risk of breaching solvency requirements set by regulators forcing them to withdraw from lending that caused volatility even though it was safe The standardsetters who produced the plan say it should help investors by revealing large liabilities that remain concealed under traditional accounting rules Prospects for Quick Resolution of Japans Bad Loan Problem Dim Study Panel Urged BNA May By Toshio Aritake TOKYOWith barely a month left before the Diet parliament adjourns in late June Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumis international pledge to settle the bad loan problem of banks in two years appears to have stalled Minister in Charge of Financial Services Hakuo Yanagisawa May met Takashi Imai chairman of the powerful Keidanren the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan that represents all top Japanese companies Yanagisawa asked for Keidanren cooperation and proposed the establishment of a joint study panel of Keidanren and Zenginkyo the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan to examine early bad loan disposal a Financial Services Agency official said May But Imai demurred only agreeing to the need for prompt action Keidanren officials said May However Keidanren and Zenginkyo May began exploring ways to form the proposed study panel The two organizations are preparing to hold a toplevel meeting during the week of May and will try to work out a joint guideline on debt forgiveness by banks to borrowers by the end of June a Keidanren official said May Yanagisawas policy which he explained during parliamentary testimony earlier this month is to encourage the private sector to voluntarily clean up bad loanswhich the FSA earlier this year said totaled as much as trillion yen about trillionwith market principles and encourage banks to forgive bad loans that may not be recovered so that borrowers including construction companies can continue borrowing In this way the banks would not fail and result in job losses for workers Countering Moral Hazard The socalled moral hazard that may occur as a result of banks giving debt forgiveness to borrowers can be prevented with restrictions under the Civil Rehabilitation Law Yanagisawa said He also said in Diet testimony that the Koizumi Cabinet needs to heed the policies of the Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport and that totally denying debt forgiveness would arbitrarily halt industry restructuring Over the past several years banks had implemented debt forgiveness to beleaguered borrowers such as large construction companies supermarket chains and banks themselves in what FSA officials have termed as the first debt forgiveness program and maintained credit lines or continued extending new loans to the borrowers Yanagisawa said that on the condition that troubled borrowers seek debt forgiveness as the precondition to mergers and acquisitions that the second debt forgiveness program should be accepted While Keidanrens Imai is in agreement with Yanagisawawho seems to represent banks stance more than that of Japanese industry as a wholethat bad loan cleanup should be left to private sector efforts his reluctance to accept Yanagisawas request stems from his longheld view that Japan needs to quickly address the problem of excess production capacity the Keidanren official said The United States and the European Union supports Imais position Imai as well as Japan Employers Association Chairman Hiroshi Okuda also are concerned that debt forgiveness might resuscitate the borrowers and make them stronger than companies that have diligently managed their businesses and as a result the good companies might in turn be put in jeopardy Banking Industry Skeptical Even the banking industry is skeptical of Yanagisawas scheme One senior official of a top Japanese bank expressed concern that Yanagisawas emphasis on privatesector efforts might lead to a succession of something comparable to the multibilliondollar failures of the Sogo retail group and Tokyo Life Insurance last year Both companies failed last year after suffering the implosion of huge liabilities relative to capital and assetsdespite banks loan restructuring and debt forgiveness The FSA put Sogo under government supervised corporate rehabilitation Debt forgiveness may not necessarily contribute to restoring health to troubled borrowers if their stock prices remain low and earnings remain poor as happened to many borrowers in the past That could mean that if the second debt forgiveness did not work then another debt forgiveness would become necessary starting a vicious cycle Analysts Not Impressed David Asher the American Enterprise Institutes associate director of Asian studies described such an approach at an April seminar in Tokyo as brain dead capital injection to borrowers Keio University professor Masaru Kaneko said May that the whole government approach toward bad loans reflected the ineptness of the Koizumi Cabinet and that he and his key Cabinet members have proved that they are failing to break the Liberal Democratic Partys faction system and the old guard hierarchy If Koizumi truly is determined to resolve the bad loan problem in two years as he pledged in his first parliamentary speech May he should inject taxpayer money and force banks to write down bad loans and punish bankers and borrowers severely Kaneko said Analyzing Yanagisawas Diet testimony Kaneko said the minister is emphasizing private sector efforts and market principles to avoid getting accused publicly In fact at least two regional banks that Yanagisawa nationalized with taxpayer money injections a few years ago had to receive taxpayer money again last year despite his promise to resell the banks back to the market Japanese Online Trading Service Eyes Expansion Financial Times Newsbytes May By Adam Creed EDerivativecom a Japanese online brokerage for trade in interest rates derivatives is looking to expand its customer base in Japan and overseas The online brokerage said on Tuesday it has contracted Radianz a Reuters and Equantowned networking company to provide local and international Internet protocol IP connectivity EDerivativecoms hour realtime market trading platform will be available to yen market dealers via their own local area networks rather than through an existing standalone system The networked service also allows the company to more effectively reach international traders A Radianz spokesperson said the connectivity will be provided via Equants global IP network EDerivativecom says it aims to attract onethird of the market participants in Tokyos yen swaps arena a market it values at billion Spokesperson Kimihiko Matsuno told Newsbytes the service currently has just under clients There are about active players at the moment in the Yen market and we intend to target the core banks by the end of this year Matsuno said Nominations to Fed Governor Seats To Be Ready Soon White House Official Says BNA May By Brett Ferguson President Bush is expected to nominate two economists to fill the open seats on the Federal Reserves Board of Governors within the next few weeks Glenn Hubbard chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors told BNA May Hubbard said the security clearance and background checks required for such highlevel positions have slowed the nomination process but filling the last two seats on the sevenmember Board of Governors is a priority for President Bush There has been no specific effort to pick candidates working in the private sector rather than academia but the ideal candidate should be someone with excellent knowledge of banking and financial issues since banking regulation is the majority of what the Fed does Hubbard said Hubbard would not name any specific individuals under consideration for the Board of Governors posts but said there is a list of several names being widely circulated Some of the names being circulated include Terry Jorde president of CountryBank USA in North Dakota Diane Swonk chief economist at Bank One in Chicago and Cynthia Glassman a senior economist at the accounting firm Ernst Young Bankers Eye Impact on Agenda If Senate Control Changes Hands BNA May By Adam Wasch and R Christian Bruce The financial services industry will move to a more defensive position on consumer privacy subprime lending and other issues if Sen James Jeffords RVt bolts from the Republican Party and gives Democrats control of the Senate and its banking committee sources told BNA May But overall key legislative priorities for bankers will remain intact if as expected Sen Paul Sarbanes DMd replaces Sen Phil Gramm RTexas as committee chairman they added A spokesman for Sarbanes declined to comment but Gramm told reporters May that he expects good relations regardless of the committees makeup I expect the same cooperation that the banking committee has operated under for the last two and a half years Gramm said A spokeswoman for Gramm noted that funding for the committees staffs would continue to remain evenly split through the current session of Congress based on a resolution passed earlier this year Dodd as Chairman Presumably if Jeffords switches parties Sarbanes would assume the committees leadership position although one BNA source familiar with the issue said Sen Christopher Dodd DConn also could be in play for the job Either way observers cautioned that it will likely take weeks before a Senate resolution could be crafted to deal with the massive change in committee appointments Nevertheless experts said that if Dodd were appointed it would help to assuage Republicans concerns about the Banking Committee adopting what they said could be a more activist agenda under Sarbanes A Democratic staffer for the House Financial Services Committee predicted that if Sarbanes takes the chair more progress can be expected on consumer protection issues that the staffer said are now being ignored such as predatory lending abuses by credit card issuers and socalled payday lenders I would see an aggressive consumer agenda coming out the staffer said There are a lot of banking issues that tend to be bipartisan an industry representative told BNA There will be no effect on business checking legislation and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reform which are major priorities for us Both are bipartisan Bankruptcy Reform Could Move Another issue that could benefit from a shift in power is bankruptcy reform HR S which passed both houses by a large margin in March However since its passage the bill has remained stalled due to the Republican leaderships inability to agree upon party representation in conference A Democratic Senate clearly would break that logjam and some industry observers see the legislation moving more easily if the Democrats take over in the Senate although abortion and homestead exemption issues could still provide barriers during conference No one interviewed by BNA expected a flood of legislation to move out of a Democratically controlled Senate Democrats would have too narrow a majority and each senators individual power in the legislative process is too great for that For example issues related to regulation of secondary mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will remain as politically complex as ever sources said There is still going to be a very tenuous division of power one source said I dont think people should now expect some big Democratic banking agenda Oxleys Role Could Change Perhaps the most immediate effect of a Democratic takeover in the Senate is the increased pressure it could bring to bear upon House Financial Service Committee Chairman Michael Oxley ROhio Although banking industry representatives stressed to BNA how eager they are to work with members of either party congressional sources told BNA the Republican party is their traditional ally This elevates Oxleys prestige considerably one Republican staffer told BNA Hes who theyll look to with their issues Sources also said the industry will depend on Oxley to stop any unfavorable bills that clear the Senate We have to figure out if hes a good bill stopper and how far hell go before he has to put pressure on the president to veto legislation one lobbyist said However a committee chairman can have an impact even without passing legislation said Joe Belew president of the Consumer Bankers Association If Sarbanes takes control of the Senate Banking Committee he said the senator from Marylandor any other Democrat who ascends to the postwill be able to use the committee to set the agenda by using hearings and other actions to call attention to key issues Every chairman uses the gavel to highlight his own issues Belew said Democratic Ripple Effect A Democratic staffer on the House side said ripple effects could be felt there if Sarbanes becomes chairman Even though Republicans still control the House the staffer said they would have to take Democratic issues and positions more seriously knowing that Senate Democrats might lend support All of a sudden the Democratic minority here becomes more relevant the staffer told BNA For example until a few days ago predatory lending was a nonissue If Sarbanes starts holding hearings on predatory lending its harder to push aside those concerns in the House Jim McLaughlin director of trust affairs for the American Bankers Association said much the same It will change the direction of the chair about degrees he said Agency Nominations Affected Another area that stands to be affected is the nomination process McLaughlin added Currently the Federal Reserve Board has two vacant seats and industry experts have assumed that the White House will move to replace the current leadership at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision Now the administration will have to plan those nominations with an eye toward candidates acceptable to a Democratic chairman McLaughlin said It will probably be a pretty significant issue he said However McLaughlin predicted that Don Powell who has been named to chair the FDIC is likely to be confirmed I wouldnt think hed be in danger Hes a friend of Phil Gramm but hes a banker and hes knowledgeable McLaughlin said Evenly Split Lobbying Lastly there is potentially some sense of the status quo for the banking industry sources said Although the financial services industry is known to give larger campaign dollars to Republicans this does not mean Democrats have been left out in the cold and are estranged from the banking industrys interests We know both of these men an industry lobbyist told BNA Its not like Sen Sarbaness agenda is a mystery to us We can work with anyone we have to The Financial Services Roundtable a prominent trade group that represents some the largest financial services corporations in the country told BNA it is prepared for what political changes may come Weve been pretty balanced in the distribution of our lobbying efforts a Roundtable spokeswoman told BNA Furthermore Its been in the Senate for some time now We feel comfortable on either side Basle rules could hit stability Financial Times May By John Willman The Bank of England on Wednesday warned that the stability of the worlds financial institutions could be undermined by new rules designed to reduce the risk of bank failures David Clementi deputy governor said the new Basle accord linking the amount of capital banks have to hold more closely to the riskiness of their loans could amplify the economic cycle Downturns would be accentuated if bank credit dried up because the increased risk of loan default required banks to hold more regulatory capital Mr Clementi said there was evidence of such consequences during the Asian crisis when leading banks with sensitive riskmeasurement procedures had suddenly enforced loss limits Riskadjusted capital requirements should be based on longterm measures that include the possibility of future economic downturns in assessing credits No one is suggesting that riskinsensitive capital measures are the answer he said Rather we need to ensure that in so far as we can we avoid sudden perceptions of changed risk Speaking at a conference organised by the UK central bank on systemic risk Mr Clementi said that banking crises had become more common Four of the G leading economies had suffered a banking crisis during the last years He warned that attempts to impose stronger banking regulation could be undermined if risk shifted to more lightly regulated financial institutions such as insurers We may find that our new rules are simply arbitraged away for example using credit risk transfers to insurance subsidiaries or asset securitisation sales to thirdparty insurers or credit insurance and derivatives sold by insurers he said Mr Clementi said he would welcome international discussion of whether the trend towards riskbased measures in banking should be mirrored in nonlife insurance regulation French peg their hopes on fiveyear bonds An alternative to futures traded on the Eurex could prove the deciding factor in a longrunning debate Financial Times May By Aline van Duyn The longstanding competition between Germany and France to be the benchmark for the eurozone bond markets is heating up again The latest instalment of the debate is being played out in the futures market where Euronext the European exchange that runs the French derivatives market last week relaunched its fiveyear European bond futures contracts The contracts are being presented as an alternative to the fiveyear futures traded on the SwissGerman Eurex exchange which have come under scrutiny from banks active in the market following a successful squeeze operation in March Although the products traded on the exchanges are not directly related to the debt borrowing programmes of their respective governments the outcome of their jostle for position could affect the price each country has to pay for its bonds Herve Cros bond strategist at BNP Paribas which is one of banks which will act as a market maker for the new Euronext contracts said the squeeze experienced on the Eurex exchange which led to losses for many banks offered an opportunity to try to create an alternative For this reason Euronext decided to relaunch its future on behalf of and in collaboration with numerous international players Mr Cros said When a bond future matures the owner has the right to receive a certain number of underlying government bonds This creates more demand for the underlying debt and can therefore push up its price At the moment French fiveyear bonds yield more than German fiveyear bonds Reducing this gap would benefit the French treasury because it could reduce its cost of borrowing Because the amount of futures traded can be much larger than the size of the underlying cash market shortage of deliverable bonds can occur If an investor secretly buys up the deliverable bonds the conditions for a market squeeze are created because others will need to pay a premium to obtain the debt when the futures expire There is a particular risk of a squeeze when there is a shortage of bonds in the cash market For the June fiveyear bond or Bobl contract traded on Eurex there are more deliverable bonds than for the September contract There are concerns about a possible squeeze in the September Bobl future said Kim Rosenkilde global head of government bonds at ABN Amro which is also a market maker for the Euronext future In the coming weeks traders will start to roll over their positions from June to September The next three weeks will therefore be be a key period for determining the success or otherwise of Euronexts efforts to capture a share of the fiveyear futures market which has been growing in importance in recent years Banks have asked Eurex to consider changing its trading rules to make squeezes less likely but so far the exchanges board has not responded to these demands Euronexts contracts have two elements which could reduce the chance of a squeeze First positions are limited to contracts Second the French treasury is able to temporarily increase the number of bonds available via the repurchase or repo market Mr Rosenkilde said the contract would need to prove itself over the next six to months if it was to become a viable alternative to the Eurex future It can be difficult for liquidity to shift from one exchange to another but it has been done before There are other alternatives to using either the Eurex or Euronext futures although none is likely to take over fully The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange has futures based on fiveyear swaps Traders can also use the swaps market directly or cash government bonds to hedge their debt positions Even though futures markets are a derivative of the underlying market they are particularly important in Europe Despite the existance of the single currency the cash bond markets remain fragmented as each eurozone country issues its own bonds Futures play a more critical role in the European market than they do in the US said Bernd Hoefel head of financial strategies at Lehman Brothers also a market maker for the Euronext future The future is the big unifier for debt market participants and this is why it is so important to have the future functioning smoothly LSE float is another piece in market jigsaw Financial Times May By David Holmes and Braden Reddall LONDON Reuters It may be a giant leap for the London Stock Exchange LSE but its public flotation detailed is no more than a small step on the path towards the unified European equity market that investors desire Having set a July date for its longawaited market debut the London institution was poised on Thursday for one of the most fundamental changes in its year history Yet the flotation is only one part of the stock market jigsaw coming together across Europe as bourses from Amsterdam to Frankfurt list their own shares and change the whole structure of European markets As listed companies exchanges should in theory be more able to make takeovers and alliances to rationalise the complex structure of the markets The LSE pitched its flotation around such a claim that it would shake itself free of the constraints of mutuality and act in a commercial way putting its shareholders interests first It should after all be well placed as the leading European bourse The trillion euro trillion pounds market capitalisation of its listed stocks is nearly double that of either Frankfurt or Paris London is the largest global centre for the management of institutional equities with trillion pounds of equities under management And around foreign companies are listed on the London exchange more than on any other Yet the LSE has still given scant detail of its future strategy beyond some generalisations about being Europes leading exchange and forming unspecified technology links and partnerships CHANGE IN FORTUNES The more important aspect of the LSEs flotation at least in the short term may simply be a pointer to a potential change in its fortunes At the beginning of last year the LSE was a mutually owned organisation struggling against a legacy of internal conflict and strategic uncertainty Subsequently an abortive plan to merge with the Deutsche Boerse led to the departure of Chief Executive Gavin Casey and left an impression of division between the exchange and some of its members Just a few months later the LSE stands poised to secure a near one billion pound flotation that it hopes will return it to the forefront of Europes capital markets It even seems to have gained the support of smaller brokerages with its more conciliatory approach Brian Winterflood chief executive of Winterflood Securities told Reuters Television Isnt it nice to hear everyone on the same side They are listening to people which is marvellous The multibillion pound valuations hung on traditional exchanges show that they have a future despite potential threats to their way of doing business Brokerages have deployed their own systems to trade shares between different clients allowing those clients to trade directly with each other a process known as disintermediation The Internet offers a medium for share trading that could yet emerge as a serious contender yet investors still seem to believe that exchanges have a future Behind the lofty valuations of the LSE and the Deutsche Boerse which runs Frankfurt are hopes that they will ultimately unite to offer investors a seamless route to trading shares across Europe cementing their central market position and their value Hopes that the LSE could itself be a bid target have already helped inflate its shares which are traded on an unofficial matched bargain basis by investment bank Cazenove They rose pence or percent to p by pm having hit a record peak of p almost double their level at last Julys debut But the route to consolidation is little clearer after the LSEs flotation announcement as Chief Executive Clara Furse conceded Flotation gives the LSE an acquisition currency but how it intends to spend it is unclear Trading is going global and geographic boundaries are becoming irrelevant Furse said But how it will all pan out is difficult to predict End of ISDA
