Friday Were Rick Buys comments about real options taken out of context Yann Bonduelle leads a person team for PricewaterhouseCoopers in London that applies decision analytics and real options theory to dilemmas ranging from valuing a biotechnology product to deciding whether to kill off an Internet financial services business Here he talks to Rob Jameson about whether this theoretical approach to risky decisionmaking really helps businesses in their daytoday balancing of risk and reward Yann holds a PhD degree from the EngineeringEconomic Systems Department at Stanford University where he studied how to apply engineering decision and design analysis to wider economic social and business issues He then worked as a consultant applying his decision analysis methodologies to problems that included consumer decision making about innovative products such as electrical vehicles before joining the PricewaterhouseCoopers team in where he is now a partner He has written widely on the application of real options particularly in fields of life sciences technology and ebusiness and has a special interest in the relationship between risk assessment validation of risk data and financial valuation How would you sum up your approach to business decision analytics Most of our projects are set up to help businesses that face massive uncertainties of some kind Decision analysis helps people explore problems and redesign their decisionmaking process to increase the chance of them making the right choices For example imagine a biotechnology company that has to decide whether to put itself up for sale enter a strategic relationship or continue to go it alone Each of those options will lead on to other valueenhancing or valuedestroying scenarios We work with the client firstly to understand and challenge the assumptions associated with their most likely business development scenarios and secondly to help them identify decisions that would help protect or increase the value of their technology or company Quantifying technical regulatory or commercial risks can sometimes be a challenge In technologyintensive fields however we have found that managers often scientists are quite willing to describe the main sources of risk and to assess the probability that a risky event may or may not occur How does this kind of risky decisionmaking relate to real options valuation You cant say what the value of an asset is until you decide what you might use it for This means that to form an opinion about the value of an asset you must explore the most important decisions that you are likely to face and that will have a significant impact on the value of the asset So decision analysis helps to define the business problem and to uncover a stream of interrelated choices that are in effect real options For example if a company is trying to decide whether to invest in a risky project does it have the option to pull the plug on the investment at an early stage if a pilot project gives a poor showing That real option reduces the riskiness and increases the potential value of the original business plan So real options and decision analysis are really very close to one another But you dont have to believe in real options valuations to find decision analysis useful What do you mean Often decision analysis can help managers to identify the key risks in a strategic decision attach weights to these and show clearly how they interact For many companies this risk discovery is the most valuable part of the exercise Real options theory has been criticised recently for being well not very realistic Is it a practical approach to valuation Its important not to hold out unrealistic hopes for the real options approach to valuation But its an exciting methodology and its also sometimes the only reasonable way of tackling a very practical problem For example when a firm sells an asset the firm might have to make an independent valuation of the asset for legal or corporate governance reasons But in many businesses today there are assets that simply cannot be valued in traditional ways because they are difficult to link to cashflows The cashflows might not exist because the business is so novel or they might be hidden In some respects a real options analysis is much closer to reality than a traditional valuation How exactly The classic way of valuing a future business is to base the calculation on a single discounted cashflow that is projected from the activity But this doesnt really take account of the way that scenarios can change or the fact that managers can react to situations as they unfold I mentioned earlier the option to kill a project or business at an early point But the upside is that if a pilot project yields exciting results it might allow you to invest more quickly and reach a revenuegenerating position in a much shorter time than the original business plan allows So to value a future business we really need to look at the cashflows that might arise in a number of scenarios This is realistic in that if the project gets the green light you can bet that its managers will be taking that kind of decision on the ground all of the time Whats the most challenging part of mapping out a decision analysis tree Modelling the links between the variables in the decision tree its something we have particular strengths in But its also tricky to know when its worthwhile to add on more detail and when its better to draw back In a recent ERisk interview Rick Buy chief risk officer of Enron said that over the two years that Enron had experimented with the real options concept it had found it of limited but not zero use Why is there a slight air of cynicism about real options in some businesses today Its strange that Enron would profess this attitude A few years ago it was widely reported to have used real option valuation to support a very profitable purchase decision They had apparently bought cheaply some older generators in the US that generated electricity at a very high cost They knew that they could mothball them for most of the year and switch them on only when the electricity prices were sufficiently high Nevertheless from a customers point of view there might have been too much hype about the methodology One problem in the application of real options technology is that there are perhaps too many people trying to tweak reality to conform to their perfect model Its better to aim for something pragmatic that clearly improves decisions over time In one pharmaceutical company we worked with recently we worked together to improve their valuation analyses by moving from a single discounted cashflow methodology to one that took into account a rather small set of business scenarios It would have shocked some academics and consultants but it was an undeniable improvement on the original approach Why do you think financial institutions are only just picking up on your field when its been applied in the energy industry for years or more It might have something to do with the relative stability of the banking world until recently and the relatively high margins that banking lines have enjoyed Also industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals tend to have more people with an engineering and science background The dynamic modelling of decisions is based on methodologies originally dreamed up to help engineers design electrical and electronic systems This approach is quite distinct from the BlackScholes options analyses that the banking world is familiar with the BlackScholes approach is difficult to apply in a real options context because everything depends on the assumptions that you put into the BlackScholes model The real options approach on the other hand is in a sense a way of modelling those assumptions more explicitly But banks are now adopting some of the thinking particularly in terms of using decision analysis to pinpoint risks and identify valueenhancing decisions and in using real options methodologies to sort the wheat from the chaff in their more speculative investments You mean their Internet investments We have recently worked with a major Dutch bank that had arrived late in the Internet game and then made a considerable number of investments Now that even BB business models have questions marks hanging over them and many BC businesses are already under water they wanted to work out which investments might contain real value In this situation its a case of ranking priorities and helping the bank make sense of what could turn into a decisionmaking chaos rather than sophisticated valuation Its not just a case of whether an internet investment should be killed off but the problem of whether continued funding for it should take priority over budget demands for major IT upgrades in existing businesses and so on These are very practical questions and they have to be answered somehow Are there other areas in financial institutions that seem accessible to this approach Yes for example we think it can help work out the value associated with various approaches to marketing a new bank business line At the moment many banks are chasing highnetworth individuals but its not always clear which kind of individual a particular bank should decide to pursue The bank might have a regional or industry advantage already in one particular area for example music business people But what is the churn rate associated with this kind of customer What is the profitability associated with the customer segment Will the time and cost benefits of the advantages the bank has in the sector outweigh any disadvantages Weighing up this kind of complex problem where one thing leads to and depends on another is what decision and real options analysis is good at Is there any way of rigorously backtesting or validating real options valuations In all honesty not really The problem is that by the time the option is exercised many of the variables surrounding it will have changed so its difficult to compare our original analysis with how things turn out However the value of the analysis comes not only from the final number the value of this asset is X but also from providing a thorough process an outsiders point of view an understanding of the sources of value and in short a bit of clearer thinking If real options are so important why are they so rarely cited in communications to shareholders and equity analysts The battle is still to convince companies to use real option valuations as a significant part of their internal analysis Even in major companies in the oil gas and pharmaceutical sectors where the ideas have taken some root internally there seems to be a lot of reluctance to use them in external communication We are working with analysts to understand better what they need to if we are to move things on to the next step How does the riskiness of a business in terms of the major strategic dilemmas it faces relate to its share value and its capital structure Thats a big question Its related to work my colleagues do on the optimal debttoequity capital structure and gearing of a corporation which in turn arises out of the likely revenue and cost volatilities of the business The more volatile the business the less gearing it can sustain and the higher the cost of capital Our work touches on this in the sense that exercising many specific real options can allow a firm to change its nature and thus also its risk profile One classic example is the pharmaceutical industry A host of different kinds of companies service that industry from big pharma companies through to smaller biotechnology startups and runofthemill contract research organisations A contract research organisation is often operating within a very competitive environment with relatively few risksit does not invest in drug development itself but also very thin margins But in fact a few of these companies have used the skills and knowledge they have developed to become much more substantial and profitable healthcare companies of various kinds Its an example of a company exercising the real options that lie within its skills and assets to transform its own identity Rob Jameson ERisk

class in Dallas so we can all three get together and hopefully I can make some progress on getting a paper underway by the three of us Ill get you more info as the time nears but its shaping up like a great day John At AM you wrote Sunday May AM ET Biz School Grads Rediscover Energy By Carolyn Koo NEW YORK Reuters Lets face it Getting a job in the staid energy business hasnt exactly been considered the pinnacle of success for ambitious business school graduates Maybe it should be since a national energy crisis makes conditions ripe for a resurgence of interest in the industry from both newly minted MBAs and experienced executives At the very least power companies wont soon go out of business given record profits for many in the last year at a time when dotcoms and tech companies are struggling or failing The industry is seen as a growth industry with a lot of happenings and its very newsy said Randy Wheeless a spokesman for Duke Energy Corp NYSEDUK news a traditional North Carolina utility which now trades power all over the country After all with the advent of deregulation more financiallyoriented jobs are available Also students are more aware of energy issues including blackouts in California which have featured prominently in the headlines And just last week President Bush himself a former oilman unveiled a new national energy plan to combat the crisis That plan calls for the use of cleanerburning coal and possibly nuclear power as well as more traditional fuels like natural gas and could open up brandnew avenues of employment in the business Dukes Wheeless noted that the utility has seen more interest in its openings and for that reason has stepped up its recruiting at college campuses That interest stems from factors like the growth of the industry which moves at a very dynamic and aggressive pace said James Peters a spokesman for Mirant Corp NYSEMIR news which markets electricity and natural gas and owns power plants from North America to Asia The hours are better than investment banking and you get the same kind of money he added Indeed the power industry has undergone a sea change Because of deregulation there are new management opportunities and new trading opportunities in the electricity and natural gas industries explained Stephen Brown director of energy economics at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Deregulation enabled utilities to engage in the profitable business of selling wholesale power across borders opening the way for new opportunities that cater specifically to the strengths of people with financial backgrounds The new merchant energy companies have built real dynamic cultures with a commercial orientation and a market focus said Ron Lumbra an executive director who specializes in the merchant energy field at recruitment firm Russell Reynolds Its a business where theres a huge component in marketing trading and structured transactions he added The MBA curriculum with its emphasis on finance and risk management teaches skills that are transferable to the new needs of energy companies With their skill set they can go into a number of different areas like strategic development risk management trading and anything on the commercial side of the business noted Kim Pollard a recruiter at Richard Wayne and Roberts This new emphasis means that energy companies are beginning to look like hightech companies Theres a real demand for talent Lumbra said And these companies can compete with any company in any industry A prime example of a new energy company is Enron Corp NYSEENE news which trades everything from electricity to broadband to weather derivatives Other names are Dynegy Inc NYSEDYN news El Paso Corp NYSEEPG news and Duke Energy Mirant for instance recruits students from Duke University University of Chicago and Rice University among others Exelon Corp NYSEEXE news also stepped up its recruiting efforts three years ago according to Caryl Sabine a consultant at Exelon Power Team Exelons wholesale trading and marketing organization During the recruiting season in September Exelon will target business schools at Harvard the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania the University of Chicago Cornell University and Carnegie Mellon University among others New business school graduates arent the only ones considering a career in the energy sector either Lumbra pointed out that at more senior levels theres also much more willingness to discuss a move to the energy business from a crosssection of other industries including professional services technology companies industrial companies and financial services firms Thats partly because of the attention commanded by the energy crisis which has included rolling blackouts in California where deregulation failed With millions and even billions of dollars at stake in markets like this companies are seeking seasoned executives Energy is not so much a takeforgranted kind of service anymore where you just flip a switch or pull up to the gas pump Lumbra said John D Martin Carr P Collins Chair in Finance Finance Department Baylor University PO Box Waco TX Office Fax J ayloredu web
