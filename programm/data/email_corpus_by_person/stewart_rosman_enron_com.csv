Journal LOS ANGELES Southern California power plants already stressed to their limits last summer got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce electricity But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns that an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the US is putting the reliability of the nations electricity supply at risk Thats because virtually all power plants now under construction in the US burn gas and only gas The units affected this week in San Diego were able to shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were constructed to burn oil Generators have been reluctant to add a dualfuel flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than gas and generally has been costlier In California where gassupply problems first surfaced on Monday in San Diego there is pessimism about a Hydralike energy crisis that seems to grow new heads every day The state weathered threedozen electrical emergencies last summer caused by a shortage of electricity Officials had hoped to solve the problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants Now theyre finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical problem and into a gas problem One official who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single fuel said this weeks disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil gas and electricity affect each other We dont just need new generating plants and transmission lines we may need pipelines too said Terry Winter chief executive officer of the California Independent System Operator the organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies You cant look at these things in isolation The naturalgas problems surfaced when the local gasdistribution company San Diego Gas Electric Co notified powerplant operators and a handful of industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half In California residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas and industrial uses are regarded as secondary even if they are generating plants Dynegy Inc the Houstonbased energy concern that owns some of the older plants that serve San Diego immediately switched to oil But it didnt like doing so its plants create three times as much pollution when they burn oil and exhaust valuable airpollution emission credits that power plants here need to operate The San Diego units couldnt simply be shut down because the state was short of power Roughly of the states capacity already was offline including many of its nuclear units as most of those plants are now undergoing repair after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer Whats more the gaspipeline system that feeds San Diego isnt big enough to begin with The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and not big power plants The problems could persist off and on through the winter Thats because gasstorage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation but especially in California because it ran its gasfired units so hard last summer This time last year Southern California had billion cubic feet of gas in storage Now its roughly billion cubic feet or less Prices also have moved up sharply from roughly a million British thermal units to around this week Nationally storage levels are down about from a year ago Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation said John Lavorato chief operating officer of Enron North America a unit of Enron Corp of Houston But he said theyre headed up in the Northeast based on cold weather forecast for the next days to two weeks High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product electricity In California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was per megawatt hour Thats double the price a week ago and five times the price a year earlier

Journal LOS ANGELES Southern California power plants already stressed to their limits last summer got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce electricity But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns that an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the US is putting the reliability of the nations electricity supply at risk Thats because virtually all power plants now under construction in the US burn gas and only gas The units affected this week in San Diego were able to shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were constructed to burn oil Generators have been reluctant to add a dualfuel flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than gas and generally has been costlier In California where gassupply problems first surfaced on Monday in San Diego there is pessimism about a Hydralike energy crisis that seems to grow new heads every day The state weathered threedozen electrical emergencies last summer caused by a shortage of electricity Officials had hoped to solve the problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants Now theyre finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical problem and into a gas problem One official who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single fuel said this weeks disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil gas and electricity affect each other We dont just need new generating plants and transmission lines we may need pipelines too said Terry Winter chief executive officer of the California Independent System Operator the organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies You cant look at these things in isolation The naturalgas problems surfaced when the local gasdistribution company San Diego Gas Electric Co notified powerplant operators and a handful of industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half In California residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas and industrial uses are regarded as secondary even if they are generating plants Dynegy Inc the Houstonbased energy concern that owns some of the older plants that serve San Diego immediately switched to oil But it didnt like doing so its plants create three times as much pollution when they burn oil and exhaust valuable airpollution emission credits that power plants here need to operate The San Diego units couldnt simply be shut down because the state was short of power Roughly of the states capacity already was offline including many of its nuclear units as most of those plants are now undergoing repair after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer Whats more the gaspipeline system that feeds San Diego isnt big enough to begin with The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and not big power plants The problems could persist off and on through the winter Thats because gasstorage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation but especially in California because it ran its gasfired units so hard last summer This time last year Southern California had billion cubic feet of gas in storage Now its roughly billion cubic feet or less Prices also have moved up sharply from roughly a million British thermal units to around this week Nationally storage levels are down about from a year ago Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation said John Lavorato chief operating officer of Enron North America a unit of Enron Corp of
