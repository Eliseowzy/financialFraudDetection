actively participated with Peter G I had the agenda discussion items and guided the conversation The call was brief and enabled HP and Peter G to discuss wireless initiatives briefly Then Peter G literally read from my notes the message you gave him about the need for HP to support the process on both the buy and sell sides The call went well message was delivered and Darrin will follow up with HP so they can come in to Enron and present the wireless intiative Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy but not Gerry Cashiola were on the call Greg Pyle made a note of saying that HP realized that they were going to have to fully support the process on both the buy and sell sides I will still connect back with Greg Pyle by phone SJ Original Message From Medcalf Jennifer Sent Monday December AM To

Carmen Perez today Fedex account rep on any news from Fedex lawyers and team regarding Fedexs response to lawsuit issue update Third George Wasaff has made himself available to fly to Memphis with

relationship Ive asked John to keep us in the loop on the developments with these four items and what he finally decides to do on the Fedex account HP Wireless conference call with Peter G went fine Peter G has asked Darrin to set up a follow up meeting with HP after when the Enron wireless team returns from London This is in progress EFSDatawarehouse equipment meeting set for early Jan Spoke with Peter G I spoke with Bill Dwyer directly last week and he would welcome the opportunity to work more closely with Enron but would want to work in concert with the sales force My emailed question to you was as follows Do we just wait to hear back from Greg Pyle given your phone call to him and Peter G message delivered to him on Kinkos Connected Mike Rabon to Kinkos CIO via conference call That enables the EBS proposition to move forward with Kinkos Also connected Ed Quinn and Chris Charbonneau to VP of purchasing He is the initial decision maker Chris Charbonneau and I got on a follow up conference call with VP of Purchasing and found that he had already received a business proposition from EIM Pulp Paper team months ago But the offer was not as competitive as the options offered by the Kinkos paper mills Ed and Chris have some homework to do to improve the offer and get back to the VP of Purchasing Once we get past this initial hurdle I will work with Quinn and Charbonneau on getting to the CFOs office as necessary So both sides are moving foward here Also had Ed Quinn meet with Craig Brown and Tracy F on office automation pulled Jeff Youngflesh up to speed as well since he couldnt attend the meeting Ed had some great ideas for the process Continental Wasaff will speak briefly with Ron Howard on Wednesday at PM as a follow up thankyou Meeting minutes sent out Will be

<26489193.1075849625578.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,sarah-joy.hunter@enron.com,2000-12-11 00:35:00,Continental Briefing for EnronContinental meeting December th from trading floor tour Cc Shankman In preparation for the meeting on December th with Larry Kellner CFO Continental Airlines I have noted below some background on the EnronContinental relationship and the purpose for the meeting Mr Shankman please advise if you would like me to distribute this to the attendees EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Over the past several years Enron has been hedging Continentals crude oil The relationship has been beneficial to both sides As a result since Enron has made over million and Continental has saved over million The purpose for the December th meeting is to address three initiatives in order of economic value fuel management weather derivatives and plastics hedging VaR analysis Several new initiatives being proposed to Continental include the following exchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets Craig Breslau Originator transacting financial swaps on line Larry Gagliardi Originator creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry Mark Tawney and Gary Taylor Originators outsourcing Continentals antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging these products with Enron Alan Engberg Originator Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines Ron Howard Vice President Food Services Larry Kellner Chief Financial Officer Greg Hartford Vice President Fuel Management Company Jeff Misner Vice President and Treasurer tentative Meeting Attendees from Enron Jeff Shankman President and COO Enron Global Markets John Nowlan Vice President Enron Global Markets Craig Breslau Vice President Enron North America Mark Tawney Director Enron Global Markets tentative DISCUSSION Developed through conversations with Alan Engberg Larry Gagliardi Gary Taylor Craig Breslau Tracy Ramsey and Lucy Ortiz Enron Buy Side with Continental Current Enron verifiable spend on Continental airline tickets was approximately million in FY and million for the first six months of Enron Sell Side with Continental FUEL MANAGEMENT Current Business Over the past years Craig Breslau and others have been managing a strong relationship with Greg Hartford VP Continental Fuel Management hedging Continentals crude oil The first transaction was on January a one month Forward on Kero Since then Enron has completed transactions with two commodities KERO and Crude Current business consists of three crude call options settling in December and January and Value to Enron Enron has earned October Value to Continental Continental has saved October Possible next steps a A transaction where Enron exchanges call options on crude oil for airline tickets b Financial jet swaps on line Larry Gagliardi has already spoken with Rick Pressly Director Continental Fuel Management regarding financial jet swaps on line At the time Pressly was not interested in pursuing this product offering Value to Continental for b a more perfect hedge as opposed to hedging with crude oil since hedging jet fuel with jet is a more perfect hedge Enron could offer services for the whole year and explore multiyear options as well both with financial and physical jet fuel Possible next steps Would Larry Kellner be interested in a or b Enron could also supply Continental with jet fuel physical in the following locations such as the US Gulf Coast New York harbor the US West Coast and Europe Enron is doing this now with Delta airlines in New York harbor If so Gagliardi could provide a guest password and Enron Online identification number if Kellners office wanted to review the product WEATHER DERIVATIVE PRODUCT Business proposition Create a basket of weather related risks such that aggregate bad weather above a tolerable level would result in payment from Enron to Continental Continental Airlines clearly has exposure to weather as indicated in their annual reports and periodic press releases particularly those discussing earnings It is extremely difficult to envision the perfect weather hedge for all of Continentals weather related exposure However it is not difficult to envision simple ways to reduce a large portion of it Continental has hubs in Houston Newark and Cleveland The weather conditions that create delays and increased costs in these areas include rainfall above certain amounts snowfall above certain amounts temperatures below freezing deicing costs winds above a certain speed etc Value to us Create value by designing a basket of these risks Value to them Creation of a weather hedge to protect Continentals exposure Possible next steps Upper management would need to issue a directive to various groups within Continental to describe what weather conditions affect the bottom line how much they affect the bottom line and then ask each group to attach a confidence level to each of their estimates Continental could start a weather risk management program by only hedging a weighted average of their exposure x their confidence level or some portion thereof Exposure areas would be categorized according to the following Clear exposure Quantifiable Clear exposure Difficult to quantify Potential exposure Quantifiable Potential exposure Difficult to quantify For each of the above categories Enron would also need an indication of whether Continental has historical cost data against which we can regress historical weather data Enrons weather derivatives team could then sit down with Kirk Rummel Director and Airport Services Division Controller and some of his team or others designated by Kellner and brainstorm about different types of weather that cause increased cost to Continental Gary Taylor made a brief presentation to Rummel on November th no follow up action with Enron has taken place to date PLASTICS Business proposition Alan Engberg proposed that Continental outsource their antifreeze risk ethylene glycol propylene glycol and plastics high impact polystyrene polyethylene by hedging those products with Enron Value to Continental CostBudget certainty assuming a perfect hedge whereby their purchase contracts are linked to the index used for hedging and associated reduction in volatility of cash flows Value to Enron The value is approximately million notional value if they hedged of their million pound polystyrene exposure Since Continental has not yet shared the size of their antifreeze buy Engberg cannot comment on the potential value to Enron though he is fairly certain it would be much larger than million Possible next steps This proposition is being considered by Ron Howards team at Continental Continental needs to share their antifreeze spend with Enron Enron could then develop a proposal to Continental that includes perceived benefits of outsourcing their commodity risk to Enron Could a followup meeting with Ron Howards team and Larry Kellners designated contact be arranged to facilitate this process Alan Engberg also recommends working with Continental on a strategic approach to modelling their overall exposures using VaR may prove extremely powerful and rewarding to both companies David Port is already x looking at ways to outsource Enrons expertise in this area Continental could be a pioneer in the effort Factors to model would include jet fuel natural gas electricity currency interest rates plastics antifreeze paper and metal

preparation for the meeting on December th with Larry Kellner CFO Continental Airlines I have noted below some background on the EnronContinental relationship and the purpose for the meeting Mr Shankman please advise if you would like me to distribute this to the attendees EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Over the past several years Enron has been hedging Continentals crude oil The relationship has been beneficial to both sides As a result since Enron has made over million and Continental has saved over million The purpose for the December th meeting is to address three initiatives in order of economic value fuel management weather derivatives and plastics hedging VaR analysis Several new initiatives being proposed to Continental include the following exchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets Craig Breslau Originator transacting financial swaps on line Larry Gagliardi Originator creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry Mark Tawney and Gary Taylor Originators outsourcing Continentals antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging these products with Enron Alan Engberg Originator Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines Ron Howard Vice President Food Services Larry Kellner Chief Financial Officer Greg Hartford Vice President Fuel Management Company Jeff Misner Vice President and Treasurer tentative Meeting Attendees from Enron Jeff Shankman President and COO Enron Global Markets John Nowlan Vice President Enron Global Markets Craig Breslau Vice President Enron North America Mark Tawney Director Enron Global Markets tentative DISCUSSION Developed through conversations with Alan Engberg Larry Gagliardi Gary Taylor Craig Breslau Tracy Ramsey and Lucy Ortiz Enron Buy Side with Continental Current Enron verifiable spend on Continental airline tickets was approximately million in FY and million for the first six months of Enron Sell Side with Continental FUEL MANAGEMENT Current Business Over the past years Craig Breslau and others have been managing a strong relationship with Greg Hartford VP Continental Fuel Management hedging Continentals crude oil The first transaction was on January a one month Forward on Kero Since then Enron has completed transactions with two commodities KERO and Crude Current business consists of three crude call options settling in December and January and Value to Enron Enron has earned October Value to Continental Continental has saved October Possible next steps a A transaction where Enron exchanges call options on crude oil for airline tickets b Financial jet swaps on line Larry Gagliardi has already spoken with Rick Pressly Director Continental Fuel Management regarding financial jet swaps on line At the time Pressly was not interested in pursuing this product offering Value to Continental for b a more perfect hedge as opposed to hedging with crude oil since hedging jet fuel with jet is a more perfect hedge Enron could offer services for the whole year and explore multiyear options as well both with financial and physical jet fuel Possible next steps Would Larry Kellner be interested in a or b Enron could also supply Continental with jet fuel physical in the following locations such as the US Gulf Coast New York harbor the US West Coast and Europe Enron is doing this now with Delta airlines in New York harbor If so Gagliardi could provide a guest password and Enron Online identification number if Kellners office wanted to review the product WEATHER DERIVATIVE PRODUCT Business proposition Create a basket of weather related risks such that aggregate bad weather above a tolerable level would result in payment from Enron to Continental Continental Airlines clearly has exposure to weather as indicated in their annual reports and periodic press releases particularly those discussing earnings It is extremely difficult to envision the perfect weather hedge for all of Continentals weather related exposure However it is not difficult to envision simple ways to reduce a large portion of it Continental has hubs in Houston Newark and Cleveland The weather conditions that create delays and increased costs in these areas include rainfall above certain amounts snowfall above certain amounts temperatures below freezing deicing costs winds above a certain speed etc Value to us Create value by designing a basket of these risks Value to them Creation of a weather hedge to protect Continentals exposure Possible next steps Upper management would need to issue a directive to various groups within Continental to describe what weather conditions affect the bottom line how much they affect the bottom line and then ask each group to attach a confidence level to each of their estimates Continental could start a weather risk management program by only hedging a weighted average of their exposure x their confidence level or some portion thereof Exposure areas would be categorized according to the following Clear exposure Quantifiable Clear exposure Difficult to quantify Potential exposure Quantifiable Potential exposure Difficult to quantify For each of the above categories Enron would also need an indication of whether Continental has historical cost data against which we can regress historical weather data Enrons weather derivatives team could then sit down with Kirk Rummel Director and Airport Services Division Controller and some of his team or others designated by Kellner and brainstorm about different types of weather that cause increased cost to Continental Gary Taylor made a brief presentation to Rummel on November th no follow up action with Enron has taken place to date PLASTICS Business proposition Alan Engberg proposed that Continental outsource their antifreeze risk ethylene glycol propylene glycol and plastics high impact polystyrene polyethylene by hedging those products with Enron Value to Continental CostBudget certainty assuming a perfect hedge whereby their purchase contracts are linked to the index used for hedging and associated reduction in volatility of cash flows Value to Enron The value is approximately million notional value if they hedged of their million pound polystyrene exposure Since Continental has not yet shared the size of their antifreeze buy Engberg cannot comment on the potential value to Enron though he is fairly certain it would be much larger than million Possible next steps This proposition is being considered by Ron Howards team at Continental Continental needs to share their antifreeze spend with Enron Enron could then develop a proposal to Continental that includes perceived benefits of outsourcing their commodity risk to Enron Could a followup meeting with Ron Howards team and Larry Kellners designated contact be arranged to facilitate this process Alan Engberg also recommends working with Continental on a strategic approach to modelling their overall exposures using VaR may prove extremely powerful and rewarding to both companies David Port is already x looking at ways to outsource Enrons expertise in this area Continental could be a pioneer in the effort Factors to model would include jet fuel natural gas electricity currency interest rates plastics antifreeze paper and metal

Peter G has asked Darrin to set up a follow up meeting with HP after when the Enron wireless team returns from London This is in progress EFSDatawarehouse equipment meeting set for early Jan Spoke with Peter G I spoke with Bill Dwyer directly last week and he would welcome the opportunity to work more closely with Enron but would want to work in concert with the sales force My emailed question to you was as follows Do we just wait to hear back from Greg Pyle given your phone call to him and Peter G message delivered to him on Kinkos Connected Mike Rabon to Kinkos CIO via conference call That enables the EBS proposition to move forward with Kinkos Also connected Ed Quinn and Chris Charbonneau to VP of purchasing He is the initial decision maker Chris Charbonneau and I got on a follow up conference call with VP of Purchasing and found that he had already received a business proposition from EIM Pulp Paper team months ago But the offer was not as competitive as the options offered by the Kinkos paper mills Ed and Chris have some homework to do to improve the offer and get back to the VP of Purchasing Once we get past this initial hurdle I will work with Quinn and Charbonneau on getting to the CFOs office as necessary So both sides are moving foward here Also had Ed Quinn meet with Craig Brown and Tracy F on office automation pulled Jeff Youngflesh up to speed as well since he couldnt attend the meeting Ed had some great ideas for the process Continental Wasaff will speak briefly with Ron Howard on Wednesday at PM as a follow up thankyou Meeting minutes sent out Will be
