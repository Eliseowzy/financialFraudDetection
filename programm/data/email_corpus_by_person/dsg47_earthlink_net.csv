there should be a fourth large RTO in the West Ive provided it as text below and as an attachment in Rich Text if you wish to have an easier read by opening it up The document has been scanned for viruses Dsg October The Honorable Pat Wood III Chairman The Honorable William Massey Commissioner The Honorable Linda Breathitt Commissioner The Honorable Nora Brownell Commissioner Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Commissioners We are writing to express our strong reservations regarding the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC movement toward mandating four West Midwest Northeast Southeast regional transmission organizations RTOs While we acknowledge that RTOs could in theory lead to a more efficient and wellfunctioning wholesale electricity market we are concerned that FERC is promoting RTOs in the belief that they are inherently beneficial with little regard for whether the operational details associated with the various RTOs will actually lead to lower costs or increased efficiency and reliability when applied in the real world We dont believe RTOs are inherently good or bad Whether the benefits of an RTO outweigh the costs depends on the details of a given proposal and the attributes of a given market We are concerned that full consideration of those issues will be sacrificed under an artificial FERC deadline and a national perspective that disregards the specific features of the Pacific Northwest grid As Members of Congress from the Northwest we are particularly interested in and have been following closely the development of RTO West We commend the inclusive stakeholder process that has brought together the RTO West filing utilities urban and rural public utilities industrial customers Indian tribes and other interested consumers to debate the details of RTO West There is still a vigorous debate among the stakeholders in our region on issues such as pricing congestion management and how much authority RTO West should have to mandate construction demandside management or other measures to deal with reliability and congestion problems While we each have our own opinions about what the result of this debate should be we are united in the belief that it would be extremely unfortunate if the consensusbuilding Letter to FERC regarding RTOs October process in our region was preempted by FERC action that would mandate a Westwide RTO or require that RTO West and WestConnect formerly Desert Star merge into a single organization We would also oppose the FERC setting standardized national rules for RTOs on issues like pricing and congestion management The Northwest needs the flexibility to do what is best for our region given the unique characteristics of our grid We still expect the ongoing negotiations to resolve seams issues and similar operational concerns between the three RTOs under consideration in the Western United States will meet the requirements for an efficient wholesale market to function Finally we would respectfully request that the FERC mandate independent costbenefit analyses for each RTO It is important for stakeholders and consumers to see a bottom line evaluation of the cost and benefits to enduse consumers in each affected state This is especially true for ratepayers in the Northwest who are being subjected to rate increases of percent or more and are dubious of any overhaul of how electricity is delivered if it could mean even further price hikes Vigorous independent costbenefit studies must be done for all RTOs if they are to have any credibility While the theoretical benefits of an RTO like increased reliability and efficiency may ultimately exist those benefits may be outweighed by increased costs to consumers for generation or transmission service This is particularly important for our region which due to the presence of the Bonneville Power Administration has generally had a reliable openaccess transmission system even in the absence of an RTO We are pleased that RTO West has commissioned an independent costbenefit analysis but it is still unclear whether the scope of the report will be satisfactory Thank you in advance for your careful consideration of our concerns We would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you to discuss these issues further and look forward to working with you to ensure a wellfunctioning wholesale market that doesnt adversely impact consumers Sincerely PETER DeFAZIO PATTY MURRAY Member of Congress United States Senator NORM DICKS MAX BAUCUS Member of Congress United

to Costs in Past Two Years By REBECCA SMITH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Choke points in the nations electrictransmission system have added more than billion to consumer power costs during the past two summers alone Fixing the major bottlenecks would cost around billion but the project would pay for itself in a few years through lower total energy costs That is the chief finding of a muchanticipated Federal Energy Regulatory Commission report that supports a widespread belief that new investments are needed to make the nations electricitydelivery system better able to provide the benefits of open markets But one finding of the study likely will boost the argument of opponents of deregulation FERC found that summer bottlenecks were worst in those states that had deregulated their retail markets The study found that powerline capacity problems were least pronounced in the Southeast where regulated utilities still dominate markets and supply consumers with energy from local power plants The situation was worst in California and New York two states on the cutting edge of the deregulation movement In deregulated markets utilities and big users can buy their juice from faraway power suppliers That puts more stress on transmission lines that must move more electricity over long distances to satisfy market demand This change in sales patterns sometimes causes bottlenecks when suppliers try to move more energy than the system physically can carry along certain powerline corridors Ensuring that investments are made to upgrade the grid is a complex matter Individual states control the siting of new lines and must give their approval for most upgrades since costs are locally borne State commissions sometimes are reluctant to approve investments if local ratepayers appear less likely to benefit than consumers in distant places We need a legislative fix to break the logjam between competing interests says FERC commissioner William Massey who wants Congress to give his agency more siting authority The debate if anything is likely to become more heated FERC Wednesday approved the creation of a new gridrunning organization for the entire Midwest One of the key tasks for the organization which will span states will be to develop fair lowcost ways to grant transmission access to suppliers while minimizing costs associated with powerline overloads That will require a pricing formula that encourages the most efficient use of the physical transmission system while at the same time encouraging investors to make upgrades where they will do the most good Getting that balance right will be particularly critical when the economy is roaring as it was in the summer of when transmission constraints were particularly acute Strong demand coupled with hot temperatures put inordinate strain on certain parts of the transmission system Grid operators found themselves having to pay much more money than usual to generators located on the needy side of bottlenecks to crank up their plants to relieve the stress on power lines When that didnt do enough they were forced to cut voltage levels in some cases or to order utilities to start rolling blackouts A weak link between West Virginia and the Carolinas increased wholesale prices as much as at times FERC said showing how drastically transmission congestion can pump up prices The most costly bottleneck according to the study was the EastCentral transmission link that moves electricity from upstate New York where there is plenty of power downstate to New York City where there isnt In the summer of that trouble spot created congestion costs of million partly as a result of an outage at the Indian Point nuclearpower plant on the New York City side of the bottleneck The cost dropped to million this past summer Another nagging trouble spot is Path which shunts power between Northern and Southern California through the San Joaquin Valley The FERC study said bottlenecks there during the past two summers cost consumers an extra million That is just a fraction of the total cost to consumers though according to a calculation by the gridrunning California Independent System Operator that is responsible for managing power flows In a September analysis prepared for the state utilities commission the California ISO said bottlenecks along Path boosted energy costs by million during a month period ending Dec It estimated that a million upgrade could go a long way toward solving the problem and would pay for itself in relatively brief period of time The ISO is pushing for the upgrade but has hit opposition from the Office of Ratepayer Advocates at the California Public Utilities Commission which believes the proposed project is no longer needed for reliability and not costeffective at this time given the recent construction of additional power plants in the state FERCs study is hardly the last word on the subject The Department of Energy is expected to release its own analysis of transmission problems and solutions by the end of the year Write to Rebecca Smith at
