switches and routers By Jason Meserve write me at I got an interesting response to a Network World column I mentioned last week titled Universal secure messaging will rely on outsourcers The column was written by James Kobielus who talked about authenticating digital signatures Reader John R agrees with assumption in the column saying that for these signatures attached at the bottom of the message to carry any weight they need to be validated To prove his point he attached a signature to his message To the naked eye one would think its OK But the signature was one he pulled off an old CERT alert Obviously I dont check digital signatures that vigorously John writes there are a couple other common foibles in dealing with email signatures Assumption that if the from ID is of a friend it must have been consciously sent by that person Besides outright SMTP forgery fakemail via port it is possible that another person is using the friends system and sent the email or that a software routine hooked into the friends email account The latter has been the modus operandi of some recent worms and Trojans John writes Failure to understand the difference between the userID and the domain portions of an email address In one type of Web scam a perpetrator gets say a Hotmail or Juno account with a user ID that looks a lot like a trusted company name Naive people receive the email and think it is from a trusted company For example a scam artist getting a address and passing himself off as a Network World representative he writes Loosely related to the email insecurities are some Web link tricks but this is for another time Thanks for the email John Maybe well have to start signing our emails You can read the Kobielus column at columnistskobielushtml Todays bug patches and
