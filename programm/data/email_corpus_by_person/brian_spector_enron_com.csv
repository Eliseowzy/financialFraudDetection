PM To Cynthia HarknessEnron nron Communications Evan BetzerEnron nron Communications Brian SpectorEnron nron Communications cc Subject The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition December Review Outlook California Messes Up What a lovely mess in California Wholesale electricity prices are zooming power reserve margins are shrinking the states two biggest utilities are on the verge of bankruptcy and its Governor has just gone hat in hand to vis it Alan Greenspan as though he could somehow make all of this awfulness go away California has created an unusual problem for editorial writers Too much blame We are dizzy trying to decide how to allocate it But heres ou r best guess The stars An unfortunate misalignment of the planets has zoomed prices nationwide for an important raw material in electricity natural gas And in California which depends on natural gas higher prices have been aggravated by an inadequate supply of electricity generation more on this later and insatiable demand Demand for electric power has been increasing at almost triple the national rate of increase of to a year Unplugged But the magic moment happened when the planets governing prices collided wi th the need to shut down of generation capacity a few weeks ago This past summer has been rough on electric power generation Some of the plant shutdowns were for maintenance and repair some because plants had reached their airpollution limits for the year In the past California would just gulp down some power from neighboring states in the Northwest However the planetary influences in the Northwest have not been auspicious either A drought has left hydropower plants with less generating capacity and colde r weather earlier than usual has swelled demand The regulators Four years ago California regulators took their first a nd so far only step toward the deregulation of electric power Note They did not deregulate electric power they vaguely made a pass at it Hence the wholesale price is relatively free to reflect market conditions in generation but the retail price to consumers remains frozen That isnt deregulation its Californias popular Santa Claus theory of economics Thus when wholesale prices started to rise sharply in June utilities were forced to buy higher priced power without being able to pass the increase along to consumers The mismatch has resulted in a multibilliondollar shortfall that has Southern California Edison saying it cannot pay its powe r bills due January Consumer advocates seem to think the utilities have stashed money somewhere Nonetheless creditrating agencies looking at th e current runaway debt situation for both Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison have downgraded their ratings making it more expensive for them to borrow These very same regulators then made a muddle when they tried to rush to th e rescue First when the price of power rose state regulators slashed the price cap on wholesale prices to from per megawatthour This of course caused those who generate power to sell it to states without price caps So the regulators dropped the cap completely only to watch prices sho ot up to an amazing per megawatthour Then the state regulators called in the Feds The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered more price ca ps and the Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson ordered Western wholesaler s to continue selling to California utilities despite the fact that they may not be able to pay their bills The utilities They not only agreed to the original bogus deregulation scheme but they supported it The scheme itself is a masterpiece of shortterm thinking At the time energy prices were low so having a plump fixed rate must have looked mighty appealing So the utilities cheerfully signed off on an arrangement that provided them with fixed rates to consumers and mandated that they buy power whose price was not fixed from a central exchange moreover the scheme dictated that they could buy no longer than one day ahead of need No longerterm or side contracts permitted In other words the utilities agreed to buy in a volatile commodity market without the tool s allowing them to hedge Nor have the utilities shown much interest in investing in metering that gives consumers a peek at what they are paying for electricity Thus consumers not only have no incentive to conserve but have no idea of how much their own use of electricity costs Consumers Of course having no incentive to conserve Why Our rates ar e fixed they havent Indeed what happened in San Diego this summer provides a scary look into the consumer mindset San Diego Gas Electric the states third largest investorowned utility ended its rate freeze in mid Rates dropped and everything seemed hunkydory until last summer when the price of power skyrocketed As their electric bills went up consumers did in fact start conserving on their energy use But they also went berserk and demanded rates be frozen again The states Santa Claus legislature accommodated The great state of California itself If this were happening in any state other than California wed be covered in sympathy California however is an advanced example of the peril of Nimby It has the toughest environment regulations It has some of the toughest plant siting and permitting procedures In fact things are made so tough in California that no new substantial power generation has been added in the state in almost years Thus causing Nimby to be replaced by Banana build absolutely nothing anywhere near anyone The great state of California which now imports of its power has just assumed that states in the Northwest and Southwest would continue to supply its needs Too bad if those neighboring states need that power for themselves California just gets the Feds to order them to keep sending pow er anyway Although blame has many receivers in this case there is only one lesson to be drawn You cant have your cake and eat it too California ought to recognize there are tradeoffs Either it deregulates electric power completely and is prepared to take the occasional bad consequences of high prices with the more frequent good consequences of lower prices or it continues to shield users from price volatility and suffers from inadequate supplies of power Either it indulges its hyperaesthetic environmentalism o r it builds the necessary power generation The coming weeks will be interesting The federal order requiring Western wholesalers to sell to California will expire the California Public Utilit y Commission will decide on whether to lift rates for consumers the federal courts will decide whether to accept FERCs price caps the bills for power for the two largest utilities will come due and Standard Poors will decide whether to lower the utilities credit ratings into junk bond territory Optimists see the opportunity for some sort of resolution were betting on seeing a wider opportunity to assign blame
