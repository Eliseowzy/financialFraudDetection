Regards sunil Sunil Deshmukh MD Structured Transactions AIG Energy Trqding W H Forwarded by Sunil DeshmukhAIGTCUS on PM Sunil Deshmukh on PM To cc Subject Solution to the Enrons dabhol Power Plant Situation Hi Jeff I have the following thoughts for a clean solution to the Dabhol Power Plant situation Background Locals Local govt in the State of Maharashtra wants to squeeze them by forcing them to keep the plant operating but refusing to pay standard Chinese torture in the rd world when the real pain starts after you part with the money and stuck in the tar pit The Central govt characters were previously involved with the fast track approval are now hesitant to help out for the fear of political damage The elctricity is now too expensive for the locals due to Rupee and Oil Price hit per the original contract that locals signed and did not hedge This has become an unpopular political football with prior champions running for cover so only bad things will come out of it if the agony prolongs Enron Enron has made a paradygm shift from physical to intellectual assets so the India Powe Plant does not fit the forward path This is an example of how not to do things as it was done with highest profile and with open involvement of political Mafia involving broad allegations of corruption and highly unusual approval and guarantee process Enron does not need this Tar Baby any more If they get rid of this problem the stock is likely to go up a better arbitrage for getting rid of this liability AIG Ambassador Wisner Vice Chairman of AIG was the US Ambassador to India during this period and knows all the cast of characters and the situation well He is also the President of the IndoAmerican Chamber of Commerce and is trying to reconcile the situation Since he is wearing hats he does not want to approach Enron for a role in getting rid of this liability I have discussed this issue with him at length I am the only person who knows ALL the cast of characters involved in this drama very well I have met Ken as we were keynote speakers at a conference and later met in NY for personal chat Jeff gave me a personal tour of the trading floor when he was the head of trading at Enron and I was head of trading at Citibank Sanjay Bhatnagar their previous India man whio worked closely with Rebecca is also known to me Additionally I personally know the current Chief Minister of the State of maharashtra Vilasrao Deshmukh all the Left Front partners Mr Pawar who initially approved the deal as the previous Chief Minister I also know Mr Munde and Mr Thakare the two politicians who approved the expansion of this project when they were in power Current minister in charge of the Power Portfolio is also a friend of mine My contacts with all of these people were developed over the past years and are on a close personal basis hence I have a neutral trusted position with all concerned I have close contact with Reliance and Tatas and personally discussed this situaton with the owners during my trip to Bombay last week As you know nothing gets done there without Reliances blessings Solution If Enron empoweres me I can negotiate a clean break in this situation that will be mutually beneficial and free up the managements energies to focus on the main business Ambassador Wisner is fully supportive of this as he just does not want to take personal initiative for the reasons of apparent confliict of interest I can broker political and business peace with a clean sale of assets to the locals or their nominees at a fair market value Enron being a merchantoperator understands the concept of marktomarket valuation better than anyone else This is more of a negotiated solution brokered by a skillful negotiator with EastWest skills and connections rather than an MA transaction The lenders interests are not aligned with those of Enron and a separate peace needs to be brokered with the locals if they so desire Dealing with the burocrats with politicians playing puppeteers in the background will cause further quicksand effect Time is of the essence as this is akin to the perishable goods problem I wud like to get together with the key decision makers on the Enron side to present this view You know my professional background and qualification and I feel very confident that I am the only person in the unique position to extricate all concerned with the ability to forge a fair solution Sunil Deshmukh Education MS Chem Engg MBA JD Licences to practice law in the US Experience MD Structured Transactions AIG Energy Greenwich CT
