Email William Darrell Willerson III Email Subject Ouch Have a Happy Thanksgiving and enjoy Jim Romes column below Might as well get this thing started early This was heard on Jim Romes radio show today For those of you who dont know who Rome is he is a nationally syndicated sports talk show personality based in California with no other connections to Texas You see ESPN is spending the season following the A M Football team for some documentary Well I guess Rome has something to say about the Aggies College Station Here is goes They wont shut up They have to go on about spirit and old army and red ass and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat UT and blah blah blah Shut up You start to get the feeling the entire school was built to spite UT Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the s passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main schoolUniversity of Texas that would teach agriculture and mechanics Aggies love to say their school is older from where they get that I dont nowthe fact is the State intended AM to be a branch of UT They are like the afterbirth from the original creation Like Danny Devito in Twins So they apparently have this complex so much so that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good All the while nobody at UT denies that AM is a good school yet they wont shut up So they write a fight song about Texas and how they want to beat them They have a Fish Camp for freshman where they tell them how bad Texas is and how good AM and all its traditions are It is the worlds largest known case of penis envy and it is manifested in everything AM does The people at AM Now we all have friends who went to AM or are at AM There are some nice people there Howeverthere is the Corp East Texas answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere For every boy scout who never learned to stop playing with his GI Joe Toys there is the Corp Now forget the fact that AM will actually let people with subpar grades enroll if they agree to join the Corp Forget the fact that the Corps looked like a Gestapo hate rally while beating down students on Kyle Field in Forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that have been filed against them and swept under the rug over the years they just this past month have had one Corps member bring charges against another Corps member who apparently had been propositioning others for a little actual sodomy Not only could I go on with more instances of idiocracy by these Khakicladshavenheadeddorks I am sure each of you have your own stories The point is We all respect West Point Annapolis The Air Force Academy however nobody respects the Corp I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world Just because you dress like the Army and try and act like the Army does not make you the Army People at AM dont even respect these clowns It is not cool to shave your head and dress up Halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year If you want to carry guns and beat up civilians move to Israel It is even less cool to slobber on somebodys daughter on national television and call it a tradition Dry humping year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool Not only is it not cool it should be against the law I know that in College Station students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn or in the middle of class or anytime anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start sucking on her face But everywhere else in the world it is looked down upon Especially if you are doing it on my TV That is why we have moved the game from Thanksgiving Because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight coed during somebodys Thanksgiving dinner We do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board Some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique counter Screw that forget makeup it is too late for that just give them a veil tu is not funny It is NOT insulting It is dumb Just imagine if folks from Texas kept talking about MA and giggling That would not be funny In fact it would be retarded Thats why UT fans dont do itPlease learn You want to lose the image of country bumpkins of a people fond of sheep of people that arent stupid Then quit building things that fall down Quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national TV Quit whooping in church Quit whooping period Quit putting up scoreboardsfor the enjoyment of dead mammals Quit spending your Friday nights practicing how to yell Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when youre running for Governor When you are filling out season ticket renewals and the form asks for your phone H W quit putting Height Weight Just collectively stop making asses of yourselves Go to East Texas tour every small town and ask every red neck with a th grade education whythey cheer for AM and wear maroon That is your fan base This is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid Nobody cares if you think your band is better They might be louder they might march in neat little zig zags but they have no musical ability The point is nobody cares who wins halftime Quit getting geeked up about marching bands I find it hard to believe you stood through your high school bands entire halftime performance And why Cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now Plus you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care Why is it cool all of a sudden now that youre in college Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds Perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe Oh waitI understand now Dogs are not ladies They dont look or smell like ladies Dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly Finally College Station is an armpit of a town Quit pretending that it is a great college town It is a town and there is a college there That should be the end of this comparison If you feel that life doesnt get any better than the Dixie Chicken and enjoy being stuck in a never ending Dukes of Hazard episode then move there More importantly dont move to Austinthey are trying to create an educated technological and open minded population base Austin is and will continue to be the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool As my friend Stephen Johnson once said If the world were ever to get an enema College Station is where you would connect the hose If you go to school at AM please dont be an Aggie God Bless the Great
