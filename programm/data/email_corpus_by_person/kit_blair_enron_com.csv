Christian Richter Jeff Boose Justin SubjectRE California Energy Resources Scheduling February payment Chris The issue here is whether the CalPX or California Energy Resources Schedule r CERS owes us for the power we delivered to the CalPX from Fe bruary st through under our block forward contracts The State of California ie CERS is responsible for payment of this pow er It is true that we scheduled the block forwards through the Cal PX on Feb and that we did not schedule this power through CERS until Februa ry delivery on the th But Governor Davis issued Emergency Orders D and D on January st Under these Orders the So Cal Edison and PGE block forward contracts were hereby commandeered by the State of California to be held subject to the control and coordination of the State of California The Orders were effective immediately Because the Orde rs was effective on January st the State had title to the contracts from January st forward Section of the California Emergency Services A ct authorizes the Governor to commandeer private property but requires the State to pay the reasonable value thereof Therefore since the State o f California had legal title to the contracts and the power supplied under those contracts on February st the State of Californiathrough CERSi s responsible for paying for power delivered on February st and forward Responsibility for payment falls on the party with title to the power not the party responsible for scheduling the power Just because the CalPX con tinued to schedule power for a few days while CERS got its act together doe s not mean that the PX was responsible for payment Once California took t itle to the powerand all the benefits of having the powerit also ass umed responsibility for payment I would be happy to

Yoder Christian Sanders Richard B Subject As the CAISO Turns CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWRs longterm contracts Everyone This is hot news showing that the CAISOCDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought I am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and FERCs attention According to two sources the CAISO is helping to bail Gov Davis out of his highpriced CDWR longterm power contracts by purchasing CDWRs excess energy as an Out Of Market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the CAISOs Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff The costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISOs surreptitious transactions This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy RealTime auction first CAISO Tariff Dispatch Protocol section d Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy bids can the CAISO buy Out Of Market OOM energy If the CAISO were following the Tariff CDWRs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energywhich is often as low as Therefore under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as Therefore the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it While there is no evidence that Gov Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first this behavior clearly benefits Davis Absent the CAISOs purchases of CDWRs excess energy CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers The media has been been making hay out of Daviss strategy of buying high and selling low Therefore Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts Of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the CAISO The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who frequently seeing minute Ex Post prices of expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to These SCs are in for a big surprise According to one source at Sierra Pacific the CAISO charged him as much as MWh for imbalance energy Where is the price mitigation here Who benefits under this scam Davis and CDWR Who loses under this scam Instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy Sources Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and the Friday Burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito There is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market OOM calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post BEEP market As one of our faithful observers told me The ISO will be billing some DRWCERS longterm contracts to SCs as OOM energy This has been confirmed by the ISO This means there is no realtime price transparency We may see an hourly expost price of say but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual RealTime settlement price There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesnt post that information The implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait days before theyhave any idea of the price This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERCs goals of creating open transparent markets Here is the email from our CAISO representative Original Message From Almeida Keoni mailto Sent Thursday

Caroline mailtoCaroline NRONcom Sent Thursday August PM To Keoni Almeida Email Cc Sheidun Donna Blair Kit Subject Burrito Can you send me a copy of the Burrito that we were discussing or at least outline in an email the name of the person who has written about CERS and what was published What is the official name of this newsletter I have seen them in the past Harvey Hall used to get it and sent a couple to me but I havent seen it for a long time Also to recap our telephone discussion the charges assessed to the Market in Charge Type are determined by CERS and are being collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS to cover the cost of contracts that CERS has signed for energy purchases and pricingcharges have do direct relationship to the Inc and Dec prices charged or paid to those who

attention Original Message From Blair Kit Sent Thursday August PM To Hall Steve C Legal Cc DLPortland Volume Mgmt Subject Revelation Steve Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds mwh is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO His response was this that the CAISO is charging regardless of the INC and DEC prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS In effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS Kit
