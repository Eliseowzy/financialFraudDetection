ENRON METALS SCRAP GROUP ENRON ONLINE MKTG cc Subject ENRON METALS WEEKLY REVIEW Enron Metals Weekly Review Good evening one and all It hardly seems possible that we are another week on already such has been the pace of activity here The ebb and flow in the Ali market both in the spreads and outright price have kept our valiant dealers on their toes as seemingly the whole market vies to avail itself of our pricing and liquidity services online Daily volumes have continued to grow with over separate transactions being seen today In fact volumes have risen by approximately since December from a daily average of to a daily average of for January At the same time the regular NonEOL transaction count has decreased from about trades a day to trades since December Your efforts at getting the registered customers who had not completed an on line trade are beginning to pay dividends finally but the migration remains painfully slow Keep plugging away The graph above illustrates the growth of our average daily online transaction volumes in relation to our regular transaction volume on a monthly basis from July of to date This weeks daily transaction volume is another record and but for the blip on Monday which put down to the Mothers day in Africa holiday would have been sensational We have asked for your response to several queries over the past three weeks and have received little or no reaction Consequently we shall ask again Currently at the top of the list if each of you could create a list of Metals Conferences you believe would be beneficial for Enron metals to attend speak at and or have metals or EnronOnline presence it would be greatly appreciated This is a multi faceted sales and marketing tool for your benefit Aside from the overall goal of creating a unified metals marketing plan we are also trying to prepare a budget to assure that proper attention and funds are given Enron metals Global exposure in Therefore if we do not receive your recommendations well in advance we will not be in a position to sponsor them We have created a conference listing which will be circulated next week Please add to it if we have missed any off and mark onto our list those you think should have our attention For those of you that missed it last week we have attached another copy of the Account Application Form The completion of this form for BOTH traditional and online customers will speed your clients access to trading with Enron Metals The lack of contributions for this review from any of you is rather disappointing We will continue to offer you items that you may find of use However the purpose of this review is also to incorporate content from around the network of our global field offices I know you are all very busy making money for the cause This medium is a useful platform to get your message over For those of you not on the circulation lists see the attached reports The Metals Crammer report The daily Options report Whilst not exactly a feature we thought it might be a useful exercise in client relationship damage limitation to explain what happens when a customer finds he cannot trade on line This has begun to occur more regularly as our volumes and activity increase Customers are allocated a credit line for EOL within the system based upon their agreements This limit is set daily as a default against the clients name basis the AS s net valuation of the clients position The amount of available variation credit on the clients account on EOL is set as his limit f or the next days trading If the client should trigger this limit during the next days trading the system will reject the trade and lock out the customer Not very user friendly as the customer is not told why London credit Hamishs team get a red flag as of course do the traders running the stack managers as they see the trade rejected The problem now becomes one of frustration for the customer as the system will not allow him to liquidate his position either in part or whole He will have to pick the phone to do this Secondly the resetting of any limit in the system takes hrs This is being worked on but we must remember that Metals are the only futures products on the system and the other OTC products on the system are dealt with differently It also serves to highlight that clients with small credit lines in the to dollar range are not really suited to use EOL Security such as gtees and cash are taken into account but can be missed but forward profits are as it is net availability that is used on the AS This will all improve with the introduction of a new bridge between the Enron risk system and the AS in the very near future In the meantime it will be up to you to keep the peace and explain to your clients Get them to keep within their limits Call them quickly when they get locked out Remember we are here to help your efforts and help create positive communication lines between our offices worldwide So send us your thoughts questions concerns local area market news etc We will look forward to hearing from you Cheers Alex and Molly Alex Heath Molly Hellerman
