<22929044.1075860839057.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mark.hudgens@enron.com,2001-12-04 14:18:27,A suggestionMr Lay I have recently begun my th year at Enron Yesterday I was one of the lucky employees who was given the opportunity to stay Fortunately for me and my family I also received an offer with another company yesterday and I have accepted that offer Today is my last day here and the only sadness I feel is for the thousands of good people who have been let down and let go I have a suggestion I feel strongly that you should promptly have the values banners removed from the Enron building lobby Communication respect excellence and integrity have not been practiced here except by the thousands of nonexecutive employees who were told to live those values and believed in them It is a slap in the face of every employee laid off or still here who walks into that lobby and sees them hanging there Sincerely Mark Hudgens mailto
