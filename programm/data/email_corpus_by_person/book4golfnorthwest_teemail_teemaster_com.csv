to be lifted If that ball lay directly in the w ay to the hole of the ball to be played then the player was stymied He could try to play around or over the interfering ball but if the nearer ba ll was struck no penalty ensued However the opponent had the option of p laying the ball as it lay or replacing it If the nearer ball had been knoc ked into the hole the opponent was considered to have holed out with his pr evious stroke In Rule Ball Interfering with or Assisting Play declared that a ball may be lifted if it may interfere with or assist anot her player in all forms of play finally
