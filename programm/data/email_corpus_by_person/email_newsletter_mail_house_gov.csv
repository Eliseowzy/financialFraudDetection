from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of September October This Week in Washington the United States House of Representatives continued its work on the appropriations process for funding of the fiscal year of The House passed the conference reports on the energy interior and transportation appropriations bills We also passed a continuing resolution agreement that will keep the government running until all appropriations bills are passed and signed into law by the president On Monday of this week as Chairman of the Congressional Results Caucus and a member of the Congressional Cyber Security Caucus I toured the hightech corridor of Boston Massachusetts today to learn about hightech issues such as information security esignature legislation and Internet taxation I organized the trip to draw attention to the need for more implementation of information technology security not only among federal and other governmental agencies but in the private sector as well The Congressional Cyber Security Caucus exists in part to educate other members of Congress and government agencies of the vital need for secure information technology systems The trip came on the heels of a recent General Accounting Office GAO report to Congress that clearly stated that too many government operations and assets remain at risk of cyber attack The GAO discovered serious security flaws at major federal agencies such as the Treasury Department and the Department of Defense situations clearly indicating large potential threats to citizen privacy and national security Some of the computer systems that run our national defense and military operations are literally an open target to hostile nations or terrorists who have cyber terrorism technology Both accidental and intentional attacks on these very systems have been detected and we must take steps to stop them I was joined by Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier RCA Congressman Tom Davis RVA Congressman Pete Hoekstra RMI Congresswoman Nancy Johnson RCT Congressman John Sununu RNH Congressman Jack Quinn RNY Congressman John Sweeney RNY and other prominent business community and financial leaders We attended a meeting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with area CEOs and hightech leaders representing the financial communications and technology community The discussion was hosted by TechNet Massachusetts to discuss creating digital opportunities HB visas protection of online privacy and taxation of Internet transactions I believe that any government agency using information systems and is linked to the outside world MUST have an efficient and secure information security system The potential privacy and security threat is not something we should take lightly and unfortunately too many highlevel government officials are doing just that Any major business industry or government organization must consider the threat of cyber attack and how it could be a devastating situation to customers and citizens I cant imagine any of my constituents being interested in having their private banking information being made public to anyone on the Internet Security and privacy must be a priority and the businesses and organizations that possess this sensitive information can not afford the risk of intrusion Members also met with hightech officials Governor Paul Cellucci RMA and Lt Governor Jane Swift RMA to discuss the future of the information technology industry as well as pending legislation in Congress designed to address the pressing needs of New Economy companies Earlier this year I digitally signed the The eContract with hightech America to renew his commitment to promoting the New Economy in the st century I pledge to continue my legislative and oversight efforts to remove the barriers to future innovation competition and growth Freedom is the answer not government intervention The New Economy has created limitless opportunities in America today for consumers companies and workers alike The eContract outlines a number of policies the Republicancontrolled Congress has designed to promote continued growth in the New Economy such as Reducing Taxation Regulation and Litigation and Promoting Free Trade and ECommerce Also this year I voted for continued growth in the new economy by supporting the Internet NonDiscrimination Act HR to extend the current Internet tax moratorium for an additional years through The bill passed in the US House of Representatives by a vote of The tremendous growth of ecommerce has created thousands of highwage jobs in this country and has led to countless new choices for Texas consumers The group with me today believes the New Economy should remain unfettered by burdensome taxes and regulation to ensure continued growth and innovation into the st century Around Texas Last Friday I spoke to the advanced placement Government and Economics classes at Palestine High School I pointed out to them that our Constitutional form of government is really just an ongoing experiment and that the continued success of our country depends on the participation of all of our citizens I told them that I am confident that we can solve every problem in America I always enjoy speaking with enthusiastic young people and I want to give every student an opportunity to experience and understand our government On Saturday I went to the St Thomas Aquinas childrens carnival and

Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of October October This Week in Washington we witnessed a horrific tragedy in the Middle East This weeks situation has escalated into a sad reminder of the sacrifice our men and women in uniform make when they report to duty each day in service to our country Our thoughts prayers and support go out to their families and to all American military men and women serving our nation all over the world This is also a reminder that though we are living in an era of relative peace and prosperity America has enemies There is unrest in the world and we must be prepared to do everything in our power to find the people responsible for this heinous act and bring them to justice swiftly The worlds brokers of terror will know there are consequences when America is the target of their hate We are a peace and freedom loving people and these actions will not be tolerated against our soldiers or our citizens In the United States House of Representatives we passed both the Defense Authorization Bill and the Agriculture Appropriations bill for fiscal year The Defense Authorization Act HR passed by a vote of and authorizes billion in new budget authority for national defense activities in FY In honoring our commitment to our men and women in service this amount is billion more than the ClintonGore Administrations request Overall the conference report authorizes billion for military personnel billion for operations and maintenance and working capital funds billion billion more than the presidents request for weapons procurement billion billion more than the presidents request for research and development billion million more than the presidents request for military construction and family housing I strongly supported the measure and voted for it The bill also provides a much needed and much deserved percent military pay raise and numerous bonuses and other retention and quality of life programs The Agricultural Appropriations bill that also passed this week will help farmers and producers of livestock and dairy who are suffering another year of weather and financial losses including an additional provision that lifts limits to this crop year on Loan Deficiency Payments LDPs and provides the first move to reopening for agricultural trade into Cuba On Thursday by a vote of to the House approved HR the Agricultural Appropriations Act with the Senate expected to follow within the week Producers suffering a series of harvest losses due to weather extremes will be able to draw upon funding that provides as much help as possible by providing upwards of billion for crops beyond USDAs recent billion estimate A prescription drug importation measure was also included in the bill and will become law as part of the Agriculture Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year I hailed the measure as a victory for seniors This is great news for Americas seniors I have always said that the worlds best consumers should not be paying the worlds highest prices This week we passed a bill to change that Currently seniors in Texas and across the country are paying as much as more for prescription drugs than their counterparts in other countries For example in a day supply of Prilosec cost about in Texas but that same day supply was a mere in Mexico I strongly support giving seniors more choices in their health care options but warned that increased choices means increased responsibility Millions of seniors wanted to be able to buy prescription drugs from Canada and Mexico in order to save money on some drugs This bill does that for them but seniors must be aware of the safety concerns associated with getting drugs from other countries Around Texas Tomorrow I will hold a town hall meeting in Mexia and following the town hall meeting there will be a Cancer Society Walk for Life And next week I will be in Bryan for a Town Hall Meeting See the notices at the end of this email Have a great
