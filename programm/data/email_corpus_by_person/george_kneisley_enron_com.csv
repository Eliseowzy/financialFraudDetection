If it doesnt meet earnings the stock could implode Whats clear is that Enron isnt the company it was a decade ago In around of its revenues came from the regulated gaspipeline business But Enron has

Enrons view is that it can create a market for just about anything as if to underscor e that point the company announced last year that it would begin trading excess broadband capacity But describing what Enron does isnt easy because what it does is mindnumbingly complex CEO Jeff Skilling calls Enron a logistics company that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity and figures out the most costeffective way to transport that commodity to its destination Enron also uses derivatives like swaps options and forwards to create contracts for third parties and to hedge its exposure to credit risks and other variables If you thought Enron was just an energy company have a look at its SEC filings In its annual report the company wrote that the use of financial instruments by Enrons
