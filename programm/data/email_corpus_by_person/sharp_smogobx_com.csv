the chilling effect that a tax would have on the exchange of nostalgia that has been taking place between the brethren Even if you dont participate directly it has been a pleasure to watch My name is Starkey Sharp I graduated in I dont remember my number but I think it was around Federal Bill p Guess the warnings were true Federal Bill P cents per Email sent It figures No more free Email We knew this was coming Bill P will permit the Federal Government to charge a cent charge on every delivered Email Please read the following carefully if you intend to stay online and continue using Email The last few months have revealed an alarming trend in the Government of the United States attempting to quietly push through legislation that will affect our use of the Internet Under proposed legislation the US Postal Service will be attempting to bill Email users out of alternative postage fees Bill P will permit the Federal Government to charge a cent surcharge on every email delivered by billing Internet Service Providers at source The consumer would then be billed in turn by the ISP Washington DC lawyer Richard Stepp is working without pay to prevent this legislation from becoming law The US Postal Service is claiming lost revenue due to the proliferation of Email is costing nearly in revenue per year You may have noticed their recent ad campaign There is nothing like a letter Since the average person received about pieces of Email per day in the cost of the typical individual would be an additional cents a day or over per year above and beyond their regular Internet costs Note that this would be money paid directly to the US Postal Service for a service they do not even provide The whole point of the Internet is democracy and noninterference You are already paying an exorbitant price for snail mail because of bureaucratic inefficiency It currently takes up to days for a letter to be delivered from coast to coast If the US Postal Service is allowed to tinker with Email it will mark the end of the free Internet in the United States Congressional representative Tony Schnell R has even suggested a per month surcharge on all Internet service above and beyond the governments proposed Email charges Note that most of the major newspapers have ignored the story the only exception being the Washingtonian which called the idea of Email surcharge a useful concept whos time has come March th Editorial Do not sit by and watch your freedom erode away Send this Email to EVERYONE on your list and tell all your friends and relatives to write their congressional representative and say NO to Bill P It will only take a few moments of your time and could very well be instrumental in killing a bill we do not want PLEASE FORWARD begin ATThtml MTAPEMRTOTRUR MBHXCQ
