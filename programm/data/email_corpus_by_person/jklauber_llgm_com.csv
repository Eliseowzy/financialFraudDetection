LLP ContentTransferEncoding quotedprintable Date Mon Dec From JOHN G KLAUBERG LGMCOM To cc LGMCOM Subject Power Marketing Alliances MIMEVersion ContentType textplain charsetusascii ContentDisposition inline Elizabeth Following up on our conversations late last week I reviewed the initial research undertaken by one of our junior associates dealing with the fiduciary duty issues in the context of a power marketing arrangement entered into by ECT to market the output of another partys Counterpartys merchant power plants My general thoughts are as follows Significance of Parties Business and Economic Arrangements As you know the precise nature of the business and economic relationship between ECT and Counterparty likely will affect the legal analysis thus it will be necessary to keep a close on that issue as the negotiations proceed It would appear that ECT generally would press for an agency relationship since the law is somewhat more favorable with respect to the ability to carve out areas where the agent does not owe a fiduciary duty to its principal However depending on the business and economic negotiations there may ultimately be some risk that ECT could be deemed to be in a partner role visavis the Counterparty We assume for example that ECT would possess the power to bind the Counterparty to power sales contracts with third parties subject most likely to specified parameters at least with respect to spot market type deals This likely will be the case even if the Counterparty has the right to terminate the agreement at anytime which termination effectively would be prospective in nature since any existing deals would continue to binding on Counterparty The risk of deemed partner status probably will exist regardless of whether the governing agreement specifically provides that the arrangement is not intended to create a partnership A further indicia of partner status would be if ECTs compensation is tied to net profits particularly if ECT also shared in losses to some extent eg perhaps in the nature of an overall netting or tracking account pursuant to which for example profits previously paid out to ECT would be recaptured with future losses but never go below zero Another factor running in favor of partner status will be the length of the agreement a longer agreement often suggests more of a partnership arrangement The Choice of Governing Law may be Significant For example in states that have adopted the Uniform Partnership Act UPA eg New York Delaware Pennsylvania there is more of a concern that a court would impose a higher fiduciary duty standard on ECT This result is less likely in states that have adopted the Revised Uniform Partnership Act RUPA states including Texas California and Montana pursuant to which the parties can exclude specific categories of activities that are not subject to the partners fiduciary duty obligation if the carve outs are not manifestly unreasonable Although ECT presumably will always take the position that it is not a partner of Counterparty in analyzing these issues ECT should try to apply those tougher standards to its relationship in the event a court ever determined that those standards should apply The bottom line may be that the definitive agreements will need to specifically state that the parties recognize that ECT is in the business of buying and selling power and that it will be in competition with Counterparty ECT is not obligated to bring Counterparty the best deals Counterparty can terminate if it is dissatisfied etc It will be advisable to list specific activities where it is clear ECT and Counterparty may be in competition rather than rely on a general waiver of fiduciary duties the courts clearly do not like advance disclaimers of all fiduciary duties particularly where like here the arrangement is likely to be an exclusive one Where ECT will need to be particularly careful will be with respect to ensuring against the use of confidential information from the Counterparty and its facilities in its stand alone power trading operations Other Considerations One additional consideration to keep in mind The potential Counterparty you mentioned on the phone intends to project finance on a nonrecourse or limited recourse basis many of the plants it proposes to acquire Like any merchant plant financing arrangement that is being put in place in todays deregulating power markets the project lender will be very involved in any arrangement dealing with the marketing of the power from those plants since obviously that is the source of repayment for their loan The lenders could drive for example such items as the governing law for the definitive agreements the term of the agreement etc In addition the lender will be very interested in any economic arrangement that could result in performance or similar types of bonuses being payable by the Counterparty to the agent as well as any clawback of previously paid amounts in the event of subsequently incurred negative results In one similar arrangement with which have been involved the lender has been very active in the negotiations of a similar type of agreement My guess is that undoubtedly will be the case in the situation you raised Thus ECTs commercial negotiators likely will be encountering multiple parties on the other side PECOGreat Bay Dispute I put on the fax to you again another copy of the previous summary I had put together on the PECOGreat Bay contract dispute for your quick reference As we discussed there are a number of provisions in that contract that ECTs originators would find of interest from a commercial perspective with the clear caveat that some of them obviously are what lead to the litigation The allegations in the complaint clearly are to some extent of the fiduciary duty type implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing Interestingly there is a lack of language in that agreement trying to carve out PECOs obligations to Great Bay with respect to PECOs own trading operations I hope the foregoing is at least somewhat useful to you although the rules in this area are fairly blurry Please call me if you have any questions John

LGMCOM To cc Subject Marketing Arrangements MIMEVersion ContentType textplain charsetusascii ContentDisposition inline Elizabeth Following up on our conversation last week I have an associate pulling some of the relevant authority on the fiduciary dutyprincipalagent issues we discussed in the context of some of the deals ECT is considering with respect to marketing the output of generation units of third party owners We should be able to get back to you this week with our thoughts in that respect and we will forward to you the major authorities articles etc that we come up with My sense of the market is that it is likely that ECT may be approached by many owners of power plants as the markets further deregulate and some of the owners of hard assets realize that they do not have the resources necessary to participate in the wholesale power markets And with the further market participant fallout to come witness PacifiCorps retrenchment announcement on Friday ECT could end up with a larger share of this market perhaps resulting in multiple deals with third parties even parties whose facilities may be viewed in competition with one another based on load pockets grid interconnection etc I agree with you that these deals carry a lot of legal risk because of ECTs commanding presence in these markets In addition I found the PECO marketing contract with Great Bay Power GBP that as you know resulted in litigation earlier this year I faxed it to you this morning along with a copy of the complaint that GBP filed against PECO earlier this year Set forth below are a few of the key aspects of the PECOGBP Contract that I thought you might find of interest including some of the contract language that bears on the fiduciary duty principalagent considerations I thought it made sense to focus on some of these not because it is a great contract but I think it illustrates many of the concepts that your commercial people may wish to employ in the proposed marketing deals they are currently examining Further you will see how many of the key provisions dealing with the key legal concepts are either unclear or confusing or never really addressed Term Exclusive Agent Relationship The Contract was for an initial term of years PECO is designated to act as GBPs exclusive agent in marketing the power from GBPs only asset namely its interest in the Seabrook nuclear plant Except as noted in Paragraph below GBP could not sell to customers without PECOs consent GBP apparently sought the PECO deal since it needed a party to firm up its sales that is it needed a party to back up its Seabrook power in the event Seabrook went down GBP retained title to all power until title passed to third parties Of further note is that in connection with the contract PECO also received a warrant to purchase up to of the stock of GBP This is similar to what ECT proposed with El Paso a year or so ago but ECT proposed a warrant to purchase a greater percentage of the stock of El Paso Note that the limit is Act driven More than would be a second bite under the Act that would require prior SEC approval and in addition could be problematic for PECO under the limitations of such Act PECOs Authority to Effect Deals for GBP PECO could effect transactions for GBP although it could not execute deals of more than a year in duration without GBPs consent PECO also had the right to negotiate on behalf of GBP enabling agreements such as those necessary to effect NEPOOL transactions although those agreements would only become effective upon GBPs consent which could not be unreasonably withheld Notwithstanding the foregoing GBP could cause PECO to offer a sale of power on terms directed by GBP if the sale was for longer than six months provided GBP could not require PECO to firm up such sale If PECO felt this was not the best course of action it could terminate the Contract PECO Standard of Care Sec a of the Contract provides that PECO shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange for the sale of the GBP Power and that it shall use the same care and diligence in arranging Transactions involving the GBP power as it uses in the sale of capacity andor energy owned by PECO PECO was authorized and required to use reasonable judgment during the negotiation and scheduling of transactions under the Contract Conflicting Sales Opportunities Sec c denominated Bundling of Initial Power Amount is of particular interest Effectively this provision requires that if some of the GBP power is available but not committed and PECO has other NEPOOL power available to it that can be used to effect a sale then PECO shall be obligated to serve each such sale with both the GBP power and its own NEPOOL resources until the GBP power is fully utilized It is not exactly clear how this provision is intended to work but I would assume that if PECO located a candidate for a sale transaction and PECO could use its own NEPOOL power defined as Other NEPOOL Supply to serve it or alternatively it could use the GBP power then PECO would have to make the sale using both sources of power It is not clear whether PECO would have to apply the GBP first or whether a pro rata concept perhaps based on the ratio of the GBP power to the total power available would be permissible Obviously this type of a provision would have major implications for the considerations we have been discussing since ECT would not want to be required either to use its counterpartys power first to make a sale or to apply some form of pro rata concept which would be incredibly difficult to apply and a ticket to litigation Notice of Conflicting Opportunities Sec d of the Contract denominated Economic Disincentive similarly is interesting and confusing It provides in effect that if a portion of the GBP power is uncommitted but PECO owns Other NEPOOL Supply and PECO would make more of a margin by selling the Other NEPOOL Supply for its own account than effecting a deal for the GBP power then PECO shall notify GBP of such circumstances What is interesting is that it just requires PECO to notify GBP it does not appear that there is any restriction on PECOs right to sell such power except perhaps the restriction set forth in Sec c above Perhaps the negotiators of the Contract know how these provisions tie together but it is not clear from the Contract itself This is very surprising since one would think that it would have been in both parties interests to make it absolutely clear how the fiduciary dutycorporate opportunity responsibilities were to be handled Compensation With respect to compensation PECO paid GBP a reservation fee in consideration of GBP retaining PECO as its exclusive agent which was based on a per MWh basis GBP paid a service fee to PECO based on a of net sales revenues It really wasnt on a net basis however since it effectively was based on gross revenues less transmission and ancillary services costs Commitments for Future Opportunities Another interesting feature of the Contract was the parties commitments to engage in future joint opportunities For example Sec a states that PECO shall be obligated to provide Great Bay with the opportunity to participate in all purchases of additional favorably priced power from facilities in New England having a term in excess of year Emphasis added As with many other provisions of the Contract it is not clear what happens if PECO and GBP do not agree on the sharing of costs revenues etc with respect to such additional opportunities Early Termination Rights In addition to termination for a breach of the Contract GBP could terminate upon days notice prior to certain dates tied to the warrant expiration date PECO as noted at paragraph above could terminate on days notice if GBP elected to effect a sale on its won that essentially PECO felt would not maximize the parties profits Choice of Law PECO was able to get Pennsylvania law to be the governing law Presumably this was a function of the fact that GBP had less negotiating leverage and needed PECO to help it with firming up its sales The Litigation In its complaint GBP alleged among other things that since inception of the Contract PECO only effected two firm energy transactions for GBP In addition it asserted that PECO entered into a number of wholesale transactions for its own benefit rather than in the name of GBP I apologize for the length of this Email but in light of the importance of these issues to the deals ECT is considering I thought it made sense to give a flavor of the PECOGBP contract We will be back to you later this week with the outcome of our research Please call me if you have any questions or need anything else John

shared in losses to some extent eg perhaps in the nature of an overall netting or tracking account pursuant to which for example profits previously paid out to ECT would be recaptured with future losses but never go below zero Another factor running in favor of partner status will be the length of the agreement a longer agreement often suggests more of a partnership arrangement The Choice of Governing Law may be Significant For example in states that have adopted the Uniform Partnership Act UPA eg New York Delaware Pennsylvania there is more of a concern that a court would impose a higher fiduciary duty standard on ECT This result is less likely in states that have adopted the Revised Uniform Partnership Act RUPA states including Texas California and Montana pursuant to which the parties can exclude specific categories of activities that are not subject to the partners fiduciary duty obligation if the carve outs are not manifestly unreasonable Although ECT presumably will always take the position that it is not a partner of Counterparty in analyzing these issues ECT should try to apply those tougher standards to its relationship in the event a court ever determined that those standards should apply The bottom line may be that the definitive agreements will need to specifically state that the parties recognize that ECT is in the business of buying and selling power and that it will be in competition with Counterparty ECT is not obligated to bring Counterparty the best deals Counterparty can terminate if it is dissatisfied etc It will be advisable to list specific activities where it is clear ECT and Counterparty may be in competition rather than rely on a general waiver of fiduciary duties the courts clearly do not like advance disclaimers of all fiduciary duties particularly where like here the arrangement is likely to be an exclusive one Where ECT will need to be particularly careful will be with respect to ensuring against the use of confidential information from the Counterparty and its facilities in its stand alone power trading operations Other Considerations One additional consideration to keep in mind The potential Counterparty you mentioned on the phone intends to project finance on a nonrecourse or limited recourse basis many of the plants it proposes to acquire Like any merchant plant financing arrangement that is being put in place in todays deregulating power markets the project lender will be very involved in any arrangement dealing with the marketing of the power from those plants since obviously that is the source of repayment for their loan The lenders could drive for example such items as the governing law for the definitive agreements the term of the agreement etc In addition the lender will be very interested in any economic arrangement that could result in performance or similar types of bonuses being payable by the Counterparty to the agent as well as any clawback of previously paid amounts in the event of subsequently incurred negative results In one similar arrangement with which have been involved the lender has been very active in the negotiations of a similar type of agreement My guess is that undoubtedly will be the case in the situation you raised Thus ECTs commercial negotiators likely will be encountering multiple parties on the other side PECOGreat Bay Dispute I put on the fax to you again another copy of the previous summary I had put together on the PECOGreat Bay contract dispute for your quick reference As we discussed there are a number of provisions in that contract that ECTs originators would find of interest from a commercial perspective with the clear caveat that some of them obviously are what lead to the litigation The allegations in the complaint clearly are to some extent of the fiduciary duty type implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing Interestingly there is a lack of language in that agreement trying to carve out PECOs obligations to Great Bay with respect to PECOs own trading operations I hope the foregoing is at least somewhat useful to you although the rules in this area are fairly blurry Please call me if you have any questions John

LGMCOM To cc Subject Marketing Arrangements MIMEVersion ContentType textplain charsetusascii ContentDisposition inline Elizabeth Following up on our conversation last week I have an associate pulling some of the relevant authority on the fiduciary dutyprincipalagent issues we discussed in the context of some of the deals ECT is considering with respect to marketing the output of generation units of third party owners We should be able to get back to you this week with our thoughts in that respect and we will forward to you the major authorities articles etc that we come up with My sense of the market is that it is likely that ECT may be approached by many owners of power plants as the markets further deregulate and some of the owners of hard assets realize that they do not have the resources necessary to participate in the wholesale power markets And with the further market participant fallout to come witness PacifiCorps retrenchment announcement on Friday ECT could end up with a larger share of this market perhaps resulting in multiple deals with third parties even parties whose facilities may be viewed in competition with one another based on load pockets grid interconnection etc I agree with you that these deals carry a lot of legal risk because of ECTs commanding presence in these markets In addition I found the PECO marketing contract with Great Bay Power GBP that as you know resulted in litigation earlier this year I faxed it to you this morning along with a copy of the complaint that GBP filed against PECO earlier this year Set forth below are a few of the key aspects of the PECOGBP Contract that I thought you might find of interest including some of the contract language that bears on the fiduciary duty principalagent considerations I thought it made sense to focus on some of these not because it is a great contract but I think it illustrates many of the concepts that your commercial people may wish to employ in the proposed marketing deals they are currently examining Further you will see how many of the key provisions dealing with the key legal concepts are either unclear or confusing or never really addressed Term Exclusive Agent Relationship The Contract was for an initial term of years PECO is designated to act as GBPs exclusive agent in marketing the power from GBPs only asset namely its interest in the Seabrook nuclear plant Except as noted in Paragraph below GBP could not sell to customers without PECOs consent GBP apparently sought the PECO deal since it needed a party to firm up its sales that is it needed a party to back up its Seabrook power in the event Seabrook went down GBP retained title to all power until title passed to third parties Of further note is that in connection with the contract PECO also received a warrant to purchase up to of the stock of GBP This is similar to what ECT proposed with El Paso a year or so ago but ECT proposed a warrant to purchase a greater percentage of the stock of El Paso Note that the limit is Act driven More than would be a second bite under the Act that would require prior SEC approval and in addition could be problematic for PECO under the limitations of such Act PECOs Authority to Effect Deals for GBP PECO could effect transactions for GBP although it could not execute deals of more than a year in duration without GBPs consent PECO also had the right to negotiate on behalf of GBP enabling agreements such as those necessary to effect NEPOOL transactions although those agreements would only become effective upon GBPs consent which could not be unreasonably withheld Notwithstanding the foregoing GBP could cause PECO to offer a sale of power on terms directed by GBP if the sale was for longer than six months provided GBP could not require PECO to firm up such sale If PECO felt this was not the best course of action it could terminate the Contract PECO Standard of Care Sec a of the Contract provides that PECO shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange for the sale of the GBP Power and that it shall use the same care and diligence in arranging Transactions involving the GBP power as it uses in the sale of capacity andor energy owned by PECO PECO was authorized and required to use reasonable judgment during the negotiation and scheduling of transactions under the Contract Conflicting Sales Opportunities Sec c denominated Bundling of Initial Power Amount is of particular interest Effectively this provision requires that if some of the GBP power is available but not committed and PECO has other NEPOOL power available to it that can be used to effect a sale then PECO shall be obligated to serve each such sale with both the GBP power and its own NEPOOL resources until the GBP power is fully utilized It is not exactly clear how this provision is intended to work but I would assume that if PECO located a candidate for a sale transaction and PECO could use its own NEPOOL power defined as Other NEPOOL Supply to serve it or alternatively it could use the GBP power then PECO would have to make the sale using both sources of power It is not clear whether PECO would have to apply the GBP first or whether a pro rata concept perhaps based on the ratio of the GBP power to the total power available would be permissible Obviously this type of a provision would have major implications for the considerations we have been discussing since ECT would not want to be required either to use its counterpartys power first to make a sale or to apply some form of pro rata concept which would be incredibly difficult to apply and a ticket to litigation Notice of Conflicting Opportunities Sec d of the Contract denominated Economic Disincentive similarly is interesting and confusing It provides in effect that if a portion of the GBP power is uncommitted but PECO owns Other NEPOOL Supply and PECO would make more of a margin by selling the Other NEPOOL Supply for its own account than effecting a deal for the GBP power then PECO shall notify GBP of such circumstances What is interesting is that it just requires PECO to notify GBP it does not appear that there is any restriction on PECOs right to sell such power except perhaps the restriction set forth in Sec c above Perhaps the negotiators of the Contract know how these provisions tie together but it is not clear from the Contract itself This is very surprising since one would think that it would have been in both parties interests to make it absolutely clear how the fiduciary dutycorporate opportunity responsibilities were to be handled Compensation With respect to compensation PECO paid GBP a reservation fee in consideration of GBP retaining PECO as its exclusive agent which was based on a per MWh basis GBP paid a service fee to PECO based on a of net sales revenues It really wasnt on a net basis however since it effectively was based on gross revenues less transmission and ancillary services costs Commitments for Future Opportunities Another interesting feature of the Contract was the parties commitments to engage in future joint opportunities For example Sec a states that PECO shall be obligated to provide Great Bay with the opportunity to participate in all purchases of additional favorably priced power from facilities in New England having a term in excess of year Emphasis added As with many other provisions of the Contract it is not clear what happens if PECO and GBP do not agree on the sharing of costs revenues etc with respect to such additional opportunities Early Termination Rights In addition to termination for a breach of the Contract GBP could terminate upon days notice prior to certain dates tied to the warrant expiration date PECO as noted at paragraph above could terminate on days notice if GBP elected to effect a sale on its won that essentially PECO felt would not maximize the parties profits Choice of Law PECO was able to get Pennsylvania law to be the governing law Presumably this was a function of the fact that GBP had less negotiating leverage and needed PECO to help it with firming up its sales The Litigation In its complaint GBP alleged among other things that since inception of the Contract PECO only effected two firm energy transactions for GBP In addition it asserted that PECO entered into a number of wholesale transactions for its own benefit rather than in the name of GBP I apologize for the length of this Email but in light of the importance of these issues to the deals ECT is considering I thought it made sense to give a flavor of the PECOGBP contract We will be back to you later this week with the outcome of our research Please call me if you have any questions or need anything else John

LLP ContentTransferEncoding quotedprintable Date Mon Dec From JOHN G KLAUBERG LGMCOM To cc LGMCOM Subject Power Marketing Alliances MIMEVersion ContentType textplain charsetusascii ContentDisposition inline Elizabeth Following up on our conversations late last week I reviewed the initial research undertaken by one of our junior associates dealing with the fiduciary duty issues in the context of a power marketing arrangement entered into by ECT to market the output of another partys Counterpartys merchant power plants My general thoughts are as follows Significance of Parties Business and Economic Arrangements As you know the precise nature of the business and economic relationship between ECT and Counterparty likely will affect the legal analysis thus it will be necessary to keep a close on that issue as the negotiations proceed It would appear that ECT generally would press for an agency relationship since the law is somewhat more favorable with respect to the ability to carve out areas where the agent does not owe a fiduciary duty to its principal However depending on the business and economic negotiations there may ultimately be some risk that ECT could be deemed to be in a partner role visavis the Counterparty We assume for example that ECT would possess the power to bind the Counterparty to power sales contracts with third parties subject most likely to specified parameters at least with respect to spot market type deals This likely will be the case even if the Counterparty has the right to terminate the agreement at anytime which termination effectively would be prospective in nature since any existing deals would continue to binding on Counterparty The risk of deemed partner status probably will exist regardless of whether the governing agreement specifically provides that the arrangement is not intended to create a partnership A further indicia of partner status would be if ECTs compensation is tied to net profits particularly if ECT also shared in losses to some extent eg perhaps in the nature of an overall netting or tracking account pursuant to which for example profits previously paid out to ECT would be recaptured with future

describes a movement by certain CA legislators to attempt to enact a windfall profits tax on electricity sellers that essentially would be designed to claw back profits on electricity sales You will recall this was one of the items addressed in our pass through clause in the proposed CDWR contract I know that we as Firm looked into the various constitutional and other legal issues relating to such a tax a few months ago so let me know if in your spare time you would like me to pull anything on it John Proposed Windfall Profit Tax The key state democratic legislators are working behind the scenes to develop a Windfall Profits Tax bill in retaliation for high wholesale prices It is not yet in print Here is an analysis of the expected bill by an attorney for the Independent Energy Producers Preliminary analysis of State Windfall Profit Tax This will be discussed during the cc scheduled for am today Wed Wednesday April AM To Steven Kelly Cc Douglas K Kerner Subject Proposed Windfall Profit Tax Gentlemen I understand that the some of the Democratic leadership of the California Legislature is contemplating a charge against the electricgenerating industry in retaliation for recent price increases The charge is to be styled as a windfall profit tax modeled on President Carters tax on oil company profits following deregulation of oil prices in The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of USC et seq The Carter Windfall Profit Tax was levied on the difference between the current wellhead price of the oil and the sum of the adjusted base price set by Congress multiplied by the applicable rate I understand the California charge will similarly be calculated by reference to a base price and current prices to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied You asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirm from either a policy or legal perspective The basic policy problem is that the tax will discourage sales of electricity in California California will become the market of last resort Another problem is that the Tax might be seen as promoting a California First policy at the expense of other states This is so because the Tax could well be included in the FERC rate base as taxes other than income taxes and thereby be shifted to other customers The Tax may suffer from legal flaws as well The principal problem is preemption by The Federal Power Act The states are prohibited from regulating wholesale power rates as a direct burden on interstate commerce The proposed charge whether called a windfall profit tax or an excise tax or a sales or use tax or something else is underground rate making There is little or no practical difference between a rate cap and a tax on all revenues measured with reference to a certain price point from the perspective of the interstate electric wholesaler Thus the burden on interstate commerce posed by direct rate regulation and taxing revenues using a price base is comparable The Tax may also constitute an unconstitutiional taking if the price allowed is less than the cost of production and a reasonable return The proposed historical base price will not for example reflect recent fuel price increases Two other potential issues arise as well First the tax has many of the hallmarks of a use tax ie the tax is levied on the purchase of goods from an outofstate provider for delivery to and use in California The gross receipts form the sale of electricity have been exempt from sales and use tax for more than years Rev Tax Code Section While this statute could presumably be amended doing so would be a major policy departure and a big step towards imposing sales tax on utility sales A second concern is the possible impairment of existing contracts as a result of the Legislatures meddling in rate regulation I was unable to identify any instance in which a state imposed a windfall profit tax on electricity sales The forgoing is the product of my conversations last evening with Doug Kerner and a few hours of LEXIS research The issues are complex and could not be much developed in the time available This material is best viewed as informed issue spotting Nevertheless I feel strongly that the proposed Tax can fairly be characterized as rate making This email including attachments contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorneyclient or

a municipal counterparty and our ability to terminate and liquidate our positions in such event without regard to the generally applicable automatic stay Attached is a brief memo discussing this issue The principal points to note are as follows Municipalities if they were to file for bankruptcy do so under Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code BCeg Orange County CA The forward contract exception to the automatic stay found in Sec of the BC presently is not explicitly made applicable to filings pursuant to Chapter As you recall Sec allows termination of a forward contract because of the commencement of a bankruptcy case notwithstanding the general prohibition for termination of executory contracts for such grounds in Sec This appears to have been an oversight when Sec was added to the BC in according to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission and probably has not been a high on the agenda item to correct due to the fact that Chapter bankruptcies are relatively rare It appears that the other amendments to the BC dealing with forward contracts are applicable to Chapter such as Sec b which allows the nondefaulting party to setoff or settle without regards to the stay if there is an existing default other than an insolvency event Also note that Colliers on Bankruptcy the Bible in this area suggests that one can nonetheless make the argument that the forward contract exception can be read to apply to Chapter filings under present law see also the discussion at belowalthough it is uncertain whether a bankruptcy court would accept this argument to effectively write something into the statute There currently is pending legislation that has been passed by both the House and the Senate and is now the subject of a joint HouseSenate Conference Committee that would make it clear that the forward contract exception to the automatic stay shall apply to Chapter bankruptcies Adding Sec to Sec the section delineating which sections are applicable to Chapter bankruptcies is not controversial and should survive the joint conference committee since similar provisions exist in both the House and Senate bills These provisions are part of the overall legislation making fundamental changes in the BC that has received a lot of press and which is controversial in terms of how it treats individual consumers filing for bankruptcy Our sense however is that the bill will be passed and signed by President Bush Assuming the amendments to Chapter filings are enacted under the existing bills they would first become effective for bankruptcy cases filed after days after the legislation is signed by the President Thus to the extent that ENA has existing contracts with municipalities ENA would be permitted to exercise its termination and liquidation rights thereunder without regard to the automatic stay as long as the municipal counter party does not file within months after the date the legislation is signed It is worth noting that the legislative committee reports describing the changes provide that Congress is clarifying that the forward contract provisions of the BC apply to municipal bankruptcies noting that these provisions by their terms are intended to apply to all proceedings under Title which includes Chapter proceedings The Senate Report goes on to say that Although sectionsprovide that they apply in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code this subsection makes a technical amendment in chapter to clarify the applicability of these provisions Emphasis added Thus this committee language would appear to support an argument that Sec applies to Chapter bankruptcies under Congresss interpretation of existing lawobviously the hoped for result from ENAs standpoint For your information when Orange County CA filed for bankruptcy the County filed under Chapter The investment pool that held the derivatives and other financial contracts initially also made a separate filing under Chapter This filing was dismissed essentially on the basis the investment pool was not eligible for relief under Chapter because it did not qualify as a municipality and it had not been specifically authorized to file under Chapter The dealers and brokerage houses terminated and liquidated their positions shortly after the initial filing based on their belief that the investment pools use of Chapter was improper Their terminations and liquidations were not undone Lastly as mentioned above you should note that even if Sec is not applicable to Chapter filings under existing law if ENA terminated a power contract with a municipality prior to the filing date for a reason other than the act of filing a bankruptcy petition eg a bond downgrade failure to post collateral a cross default the existence of a condition where the counterparty is unable to pay its debts as they come due etc ENA would be permitted to proceed with the liquidation of its position and it could exercise any set off or settlement rights without regard to the automatic stay Hopefully the pending legislation will be passed and the concern as to the applicability of Sec to municipalities will be completely eliminated within a relatively short period of time In the interim particularly during the upcoming summer when prices in many locations will be highly volatile and certain parties credit positions could fluctuate rapidly and materially in some cases particularly if they are filling open positions in the spot market it may make sense to alert our credit group to be particularly vigilant in their monitoring of the ongoing financial condition of our municipal counterparties so that we preserve as much flexibility as possible with respect to exercising our termination rights under the contracts on account of defaults other than the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against our counterparty Please give me or Carl or Jim a call if you want to follow up on any of this Thanks John This email including attachments

the BC in according to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission and probably has not been a high on the agenda item to correct due to the fact that Chapter bankruptcies are relatively rare It appears that the other amendments to the BC dealing with forward contracts are applicable to Chapter such as Sec b which allows the nondefaulting party to setoff or settle without regards to the stay if there is an existing default other than an insolvency event Also note that Colliers on Bankruptcy the Bible in this area suggests that one can nonetheless make the argument that the forward contract exception can be read to apply to Chapter filings under present law see also the discussion at belowalthough it is uncertain whether a bankruptcy court would accept this argument to effectively write something into the statute There currently is pending legislation that has been passed by both the House and the Senate and is now the subject of a joint HouseSenate Conference Committee that would make it clear that the forward contract exception to the automatic stay shall apply to Chapter bankruptcies Adding Sec to Sec the section delineating which sections are applicable to Chapter bankruptcies is not controversial and should survive the joint conference committee since similar provisions exist in both the House and Senate bills These provisions are part of the overall legislation making fundamental changes in the BC that has received a lot of press and which is controversial in terms of how it treats individual consumers filing for bankruptcy Our sense however is that the bill will be passed and signed by President Bush Assuming the amendments to Chapter filings are enacted under the existing bills they would first become effective for bankruptcy cases filed after days after the legislation is signed by the President Thus to the extent that ENA has existing contracts with municipalities ENA would be permitted to exercise its termination and liquidation rights thereunder without regard to the automatic stay as long as the municipal counter party does not file within months after the date the legislation is signed It is worth noting that the legislative committee reports describing the changes provide that Congress is clarifying that the forward contract provisions of the BC apply to municipal bankruptcies noting that these provisions by their terms are intended to apply to all proceedings under Title which includes Chapter proceedings The Senate Report goes on to say that Although sectionsprovide that they apply in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code this subsection makes a technical amendment in chapter to clarify the applicability of these provisions Emphasis added Thus this committee language would appear to support an argument that Sec applies to Chapter bankruptcies under Congresss interpretation of existing lawobviously the hoped for result from ENAs standpoint For your information when Orange County CA filed for bankruptcy the County filed under Chapter The investment pool that held the derivatives and other financial contracts initially also made a separate filing under Chapter This filing was dismissed essentially on the basis the investment pool was not eligible for relief under Chapter because it did not qualify as a municipality and it had not been specifically authorized to file under Chapter The dealers and brokerage houses terminated and liquidated their positions shortly after the initial filing based on their belief that the investment pools use of Chapter was improper Their terminations and liquidations were not undone Lastly as mentioned above you should note that even if Sec is not applicable to Chapter filings under existing law if ENA terminated a power contract with a municipality prior to the filing date for a reason other than the act of filing a bankruptcy petition eg a bond downgrade failure to post collateral a cross default the existence of a condition where the counterparty is unable to pay its debts as they come due etc ENA would be permitted to proceed with the liquidation of its position and it could exercise any set off or settlement rights without regard to the automatic stay Hopefully the pending legislation will be passed and the concern as to the applicability of Sec to municipalities will be completely eliminated within a relatively short period of time In the interim particularly during the upcoming summer when prices in many locations will be highly volatile and certain parties credit positions could fluctuate rapidly and materially in some cases particularly if they are filling open positions in the spot market it may make sense to alert our credit group to be particularly vigilant in their monitoring of the ongoing financial condition of our municipal counterparties so that we preserve as much flexibility as possible with respect to exercising our termination rights under the contracts on account of defaults

<6019082.1075859609025.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jklauber@llgm.com,2001-04-04 07:29:00,Windfall Profits Tax Cc Christian I had trouble forwarding an email relating to the same but have copied it below It describes a movement by certain CA legislators to attempt to enact a windfall profits tax on electricity sellers that essentially would be designed to claw back profits on electricity sales You will recall this was one of the items addressed in our pass through clause in the proposed CDWR contract I know that we as Firm looked into the various constitutional and other legal issues relating to such a tax a few months ago so let me know if in your spare time you would like me to pull anything on it John Proposed Windfall Profit Tax The key state democratic legislators are working behind the scenes to develop a Windfall Profits Tax bill in retaliation for high wholesale prices It is not yet in print Here is an analysis of the expected bill by an attorney for the Independent Energy Producers Preliminary analysis of State Windfall Profit Tax This will be discussed during the cc scheduled for am today Wed Wednesday April AM To Steven Kelly Cc Douglas K Kerner Subject Proposed Windfall Profit Tax Gentlemen I understand that the some of the Democratic leadership of the California Legislature is contemplating a charge against the electricgenerating industry in retaliation for recent price increases The charge is to be styled as a windfall profit tax modeled on President Carters tax on oil company profits following deregulation of oil prices in The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of USC et seq The Carter Windfall Profit Tax was levied on the difference between the current wellhead price of the oil and the sum of the adjusted base price set by Congress multiplied by the applicable rate I understand the California charge will similarly be calculated by reference to a base price and current prices to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied You asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirm from either a policy or legal perspective The basic policy problem is that the tax will discourage sales of electricity in California California will become the market of last resort Another problem is that the Tax might be seen as promoting a California First policy at the expense of other states This is so because the Tax could well be included in the FERC rate base as taxes other than income taxes and thereby be shifted to other customers The Tax may suffer from legal flaws as well The principal problem is preemption by The Federal Power Act The states are prohibited from regulating wholesale power rates as a direct burden on interstate commerce The proposed charge whether called a windfall profit tax or an excise tax or a sales or use tax or something else is underground rate making There is little or no practical difference between a rate cap and a tax on all revenues measured with reference to a certain price point from the perspective of the interstate electric wholesaler Thus the burden on interstate commerce posed by direct rate regulation and taxing revenues using a price base is comparable The Tax may also constitute an unconstitutiional taking if the price allowed is less than the cost of production and a reasonable return The proposed historical base price will not for example reflect recent fuel price increases Two other potential issues arise as well First the tax has many of the hallmarks of a use tax ie the tax is levied on the purchase of goods from an outofstate provider for delivery to and use in California The gross receipts form the sale of electricity have been exempt from sales and use tax for more than years Rev Tax Code Section While this statute could presumably be amended doing so would be a major policy departure and a big step towards imposing sales tax on utility sales A second concern is the possible impairment of existing contracts as a result of the Legislatures meddling in rate regulation I was unable to identify any instance in which a state imposed a windfall profit tax on electricity sales The forgoing is the product of my conversations last evening with Doug Kerner and a few hours of LEXIS research The issues are complex and could not be much developed in the time available This material is best viewed as informed issue spotting Nevertheless I feel strongly that the proposed Tax can fairly be characterized as rate making This email including attachments contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorneyclient or

of a municipal counterparty and our ability to terminate and liquidate our positions in such event without regard to the generally applicable automatic stay Attached is a brief memo discussing this issue The principal points to note are as follows Municipalities if they were to file for bankruptcy do so under Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code BCeg Orange County CA The forward contract exception to the automatic stay found in Sec of the BC presently is not explicitly made applicable to filings pursuant to Chapter As you recall Sec allows termination of a forward contract because of the commencement of a bankruptcy case notwithstanding the general prohibition for termination of executory contracts for such grounds in Sec This appears to have been an oversight when Sec was added to the BC in according to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission and probably has not been a high on the agenda item to correct due to the fact that Chapter bankruptcies are relatively rare It appears that the other amendments to the BC dealing with forward contracts are applicable to Chapter such as Sec b which allows the nondefaulting party to setoff or settle without regards to the stay if there is an existing default other than an insolvency event Also note that Colliers on Bankruptcy the Bible in this area suggests that one can nonetheless make the argument that the forward contract exception can be read to apply to Chapter filings under present law see also the discussion at belowalthough it is uncertain whether a bankruptcy court would accept this argument to effectively write something into the statute There currently is pending legislation that has been passed by both the House and the Senate and is now the subject of a joint HouseSenate Conference Committee that would make it clear that the forward contract exception to the automatic stay shall apply to Chapter bankruptcies Adding Sec to Sec the section delineating which sections are applicable to Chapter bankruptcies is not controversial and should survive the joint conference committee since similar provisions exist in both the House and Senate bills These provisions are part of the overall legislation making fundamental changes in the BC that has received a lot of press and which is controversial in terms of how it treats individual consumers filing for bankruptcy Our sense however is that the bill will be passed and signed by President Bush Assuming the amendments to Chapter filings are enacted under the existing bills they would first become effective for bankruptcy cases filed after days after the legislation is signed by the President Thus to the extent that ENA has existing contracts with municipalities ENA would be permitted to exercise its termination and liquidation rights thereunder without regard to the automatic stay as long as the municipal counter party does not file within months after the date the legislation is signed It is worth noting that the legislative committee reports describing the changes provide that Congress is clarifying that the forward contract provisions of the BC apply to municipal bankruptcies noting that these provisions by their terms are intended to apply to all proceedings under Title which includes Chapter proceedings The Senate Report goes on to say that Although sectionsprovide that they apply in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code this subsection makes a technical amendment in chapter to clarify the applicability of these provisions Emphasis added Thus this committee language would appear to support an argument that Sec applies to Chapter bankruptcies under Congresss interpretation of existing lawobviously the hoped for result from ENAs standpoint For your information when Orange County CA filed for bankruptcy the County filed under Chapter The investment pool that held the derivatives and other financial contracts initially also made a separate filing under Chapter This filing was dismissed essentially on the basis the investment pool was not eligible for relief under Chapter because it did not qualify as a municipality and it had not been specifically authorized to file under Chapter The dealers and brokerage houses terminated and liquidated their positions shortly after the initial filing based on their belief that the investment pools use of Chapter was improper Their terminations and liquidations were not undone Lastly as mentioned above you should note that even if Sec is not applicable to Chapter filings under existing law if ENA terminated a power contract with a municipality prior to the filing date for a reason other than the act of filing a bankruptcy petition eg a bond downgrade failure to post collateral a cross default the existence of a condition where the counterparty is unable to pay its debts as they come due etc ENA would be permitted to proceed with the liquidation of its position and it could exercise any set off or settlement rights without regard to the automatic stay Hopefully the pending legislation will be passed and the concern as to the applicability of Sec to municipalities will be completely eliminated within a relatively short period of time In the interim particularly during the upcoming summer when prices in many locations will be highly volatile and certain parties credit positions could fluctuate rapidly and materially in some cases particularly if they are filling open positions in the spot market it may make sense to alert our credit group to be particularly vigilant in their monitoring of the ongoing financial condition of our municipal counterparties so that we preserve as much flexibility as possible with respect to exercising our termination rights under the contracts on account of defaults other than the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against our counterparty Please give me or Carl or Jim a call if you want to follow up on any of this Thanks John This email including attachments

Pedersen As I noted the other day Norm would very much like to join our LA office to try to expand his existing energy practice but as I indicated I do not want to run into future conflict issues with you Rick etc This concerns me since I understand most of Norms work is on th e state regulatory side particularly on gas matters In that call I tried to try drill down more as to whether in Norms view if he were to join LeBoeuf in LA whether we would be likely to encounter conflict problems with Enron particularly with respect to existing matter s he might be handling for some of his clients My general view is that we could deal with future potential conflict issues when they arise at least with respect with future matters that we cant envision at this point If such a matter were to arise in the future in LA or CA and it looked li ke we ie LeBoeuf might be at odds with Enron my general sense is that we would most likely refrain from taking on that representationor at lea st we would check with you and Rick first about it to get your take on our possible involvement in the proceedings In that respect I asked Norm to prepare a list of those items that he is involved in now or which he is lik ely to be involved in in the near future where his existing clients potenti ally could be adverse to Enron I am forwarding that email to you to get the your sense on it I would appreciate it if you would keep it confident ial since obviously if things dont work out here between Norman and LeBo euf I do not want to hurt his situation with his existing firm or others h e may be considering In general based on my conversation with Norm today he feels that the gas proceeding where he foresaw a potential future conflict issue was in the P GE territory in the event the Southern California issues were to be take n to Northern California but he said that he thinks that future concern could be mooted if PGEs proposed reorganization plan which as you know was filed yesterday successfully moves the gas transmission issues to th e FERC from the CPUC Obviously one big caveat there is whether PGE wi ll be able to accomplish its current plans in that respect In any event I hate to bother you with this in light of everything you hav e going on but in fairness to Norm and my partners in our LA office who would like to begin to build an energy presence in that office I just want ed to make sure that my diligence was as complete and up to date as possibl e based upon the changing regulatory landscape My sense from our conversa tion the other day was that there could be a host of conflicttype problems going forward that frankly I very much do not want to have to deal with However if in the proceedings in which Norms existing clients are likel y to be involved in there would not be much of an issue from a conflict of interest standpoint based on what you know may be currently out there I th ought it might make some sense from our Firms standpoint to try to get an energy presence in Southern California even if you and Enron may be using o ther legal counsel in the various regulatory proceedings I assume it is safe for me to assume that you will not be requesting Dans services in the near future Norm appears to be a fairly solid lawyer and even if he w ere not doing any work for Enron our general sense is that he otherwise co uld be potentially helpful to the Firm in expanding some of our energy work in CA Jeff please do not consider this follow up to be any kind of pressure or a nything along those lines In view of my desire to avoid conflict problems with the Company we recently had the potential to handle a nice assignmen t for Rick that we had to turn down in that respect I am still leaning ag ainst pursuing things further with Norm but I just felt compelled to do a bit of further diligence wearing my Firm hat after getting this further information from Norm about the things he is handling now and those he is likely to want to be involved in in the foreseeable future Thanks very mu ch Jeff John John Klauberg LeBoeuf Lamb Greene MacRae LLP DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDD This email including

onesDaycom To CC Date Thursday September GMT Subject John After we got off our call I went back to listening to the CPUC meeting Yes they voted to kill direct access in California The case in which the Southern California Generation Coalition and Enron were adverse in was CPUC I regarding the structure of SoCalGas operations A proposed decision was issued in November Through todays meeting no action has been taken by the Commission on the proposed decision Thus at least technically the case is still alive Given the positions taken by Enron and SCGC in I it was thought that my clients and Enron would be likely to square off again in an anticipated proceeding regarding the structure of PGE gas operations PGE is required to file an application proposing a structure for post gas operations no later than October However that proceeding may never amount to much assuming that it even gets off the ground The reorganization plan that PGE announced this morning proposes a spinoff of PGEs intrastate gas transmission operations with jurisdiction shifting from the CPUC to the FERC That could eliminate from the CPUC proceeding the issues on which my clients and Enron might have been adversial It is conceivable that SCGC and Enron will be on opposite sides on issues in the SoCalGas Biennial Cost Allocation Proceeding in which SoCalGas is due to file an application on Friday However insofar as Enron is not a SoCalGas ratepayer it usually is not involved in BCAPs I do not foresee any other cases at this point in time in which my clients and Enron might be adversial As we discussed there are currently numerous matters on which interests are aligned Norman DDDDDDDDDD The preceding email message including any attachments contains information that may be confidential be
