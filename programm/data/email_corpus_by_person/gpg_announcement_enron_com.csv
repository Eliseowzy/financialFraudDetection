operations staff is our promise to each other that safety on the job is fir st before all other concerns that we will positively act to assure safe practices This Safety Advisory Bulletin No is issued to reinforce the need for personal safety at all times and in all circumstances On April a OneCall ticket was issued for the work being done adjacent to one of GPGs pipelines The ticket did not identify GPG as having facili ties in the area so GPG was not notified Sometime after April a GPG employee observed a contractor working in th e vicinity of an active pipeline The employee located and marked the pipelin e in the area where the contractor was working On May the contractor was excavating approximately to feet downstream of the marked pipeline routing a water line and uncovered a inch pipeline that was assumed to be abandoned The contractor was willing to incur the cost of removing a secti on of the abandoned pipeline if the facility owner would ensure it was abandoned The contractor requested a OneCall ticket to mark all underground faciliti es in the area of the excavated inch pipeline GPG was notified via fax o f the line locate request The GPG employee who previously had located and marked the pipeline informed the contractor that he was unaware of any abandoned pipelines in the area but that he would investigate further Th e employee checked his pipeline drawings and consulted with other team member s and learned that there was an abandoned pipeline in the area Team members also informed him that the accepted practice for checking abandoned pipelin es was to drill into the pipe On May the GPG employee entered the contractors excavation and drilled into what he assumed was the abandoned pipeline The employee believing th e escaping medium was air decided to let the pipe vent until the pressure relieved After two hours of venting and no noticeable reduction in pressur e the employee reentered the excavation to check cathodic protection reading s At this point the employee determined that the drilled pipeline was venting gas Gas Control was informed of the situation and steps to shutin blow down and repair the pipeline were implemented After a thorough inquiry by the GPG Incident Investigation Team the Senior OM Tech involved in the incident was disciplined as a result of his failur e to follow the procedures listed below and to reinforce the importance of safety interdependency GPG Operating Procedures Gas Testing Confined Space Entr y Excavation and Work Permits No gas testing was done by the GPG employee to identify escaping medium No gas testing was done before the GPG employee entered the excavation considered to be a permit entry confined space No gas testing was done before an ignition source was introduced into a possibly hazardous atmosphere in the excavation No Confined Space Entry permit was issued when the employee reentered the excavation to take cathodic protection readings The employee entered an excavation with inadequate means of egress No hot work permits were issued by the employee GPG Operating Procedure Blowdown and Purging The employee did not communicate in a timely manner the planned blowdown to residents of the adjacent neighborhood GPG Operating Procedure Event Notification Sequence A Gas Control did not notify the GPG environmental specialist of the release of natural gas GPG Environmental Procedure Spills and Releases The release of natural gas was not reported to the GPG Division Environment al Specialist GPG Operating Procedure Damage Prevention The employee did not properly use maps when marking the pipeline The employee did not mark bends or other changes in the direction of the pipeline PLEASE NOTE THE PRACTICE OF DRILLING INTO A PIPELINE TO DETERMINE IF IT IS ABANDONED IS UNACCEPTABLE AND SHALL NOT BE UTILIZED Preexisting abandoned pipe removal practice shall be as follows GPG employees shall contact local management when a preexisting abandoned pipeline must be removed to allow routing of other facilities Local management will contact the Engineering Department to evaluate the facility and provide guidance to the team on how to proceed with pipeline identification and the ensuing removal of the facility Abandoned pipelines that will not be removed shall be treated as an active pipeline and marked in accordance with GPG operating procedure Moving Forward The Pipeline Safety Department will review and revise GPG Operating Procedu re to ensure that team members use all available resources to clearly identify an existing pipeline as active or abandoned The GPG Pipeline Safety Department is investigating why the GPG facility wa s not identified on the April OneCall ticket Near Misses There was potential for the contractors backhoe operator to rupture and ignite an active pipeline There was potential for natural gas to ignite under traffic plates coveri ng the excavation in the area of a public road prior to the team diverting traffic from the area There was potential for a flash fire in the excavation site due to the hot work occurring in the area of the natural gas leak
