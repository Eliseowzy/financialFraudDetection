VFR AOPA KEEPS FOCUS ON REMAINING CITIES SPECIALTY OPERATIONS The FAA on Sunday afternoon released a notam announcing the phased reopening of more enhanced Class B ECB areas to most VFR operations Last week most VFR flights were allowed to resume in other ECB areas This leaves three metropolitan areasNew York City Washington DC and Bostonwhere VFR remains prohibited This is an important milestone and fantastic news for VFR pilots said AOPA President Phil Boyer Restoring VFR flight in ECB airspace has been an AOPA priority for weeks But now our focus must turn to restoring operations in the three remaining metropolitan areas and in getting the news and traffic reporters banner towers and other specialty operators back in the air everywhere Much like the release of airspace last week this release will be phased in over three days The first five will be reopened on Monday The opening will follow the schedule below Monday October at Z am Eastern time Atlanta Georgia Las Vegas Nevada Los Angeles California Miami Florida and San Francisco California Tuesday October at Z am Eastern time Denver Colorado Detroit Michigan Philadelphia Pennsylvania Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and San Diego California Wednesday October at Z am Eastern time Chicago Illinois and Orlando Florida The procedures for these cities are the same as those established for the areas opened last week Aircraft flying in enhanced Class B ECB airspace must have an encoding transponder and squawk or as assigned by ATC Aircraft without a transponder must get a waiver from ATC for each flight in ECB airspace If equipped to do so pilots flying in ECB airspace should monitor the guard frequency of MHz The notam also asks pilots to operate their aircraft in a normal manner avoiding aerobatics as well as circling or loitering See AOPAs frequently asked questions whatsnewnewsitemsfaqhtml for more information on rules applicable to enhanced Class B airspace The full text of Sundays notam is below While

flight restriction areas TFRs AOPA is also working toward gaining approval for news and traffic reporting banner towing and sightseeing operations to resume operations in enhanced Class B ECB airspace FAA PUTS ONUS ON NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL An FAA representative told the House aviation subcommittee Wednesday that while the agency is working on plans to reopen the remaining ECB areas they cant do so without concurrence from the National Security Council and the Department of Defense This clarifies the much disputed question as to who is making the decisions regarding the reopening of ECB to VFR traffic Steve Brown FAA associate administrator of air traffic services received pointed questions from members of the committee He said that the FAA has been working hard with members of the general aviation industry such as AOPA to remove the restrictions But committee members believe the lifting of such restrictions should have come long ago North Carolina congressman and AOPA member Robin Hayes said to Brown Just fix the problem will ya NSC CONSIDERS PROPOSALS The National Security Council met Thursday to consider FAA plans for restoring operations in the remaining ECB areas The FAAs presentation considered recommendations made by a coalition of general aviation groups for easing restrictions on VFR flying AOPA EAA GAMA HAI NATA NBAA and NASAO developed consensus recommendations addressing aircraft and airport security and airspace operations AOPA ASKS CONGRESS FOR HELP AOPA again Wednesday reminded Congress that the airspace around major cities remains closed to VFR pilots The problem is not yet solved With each day that passes some pilots and nearly aircraft at airports and the businesses that support them continue to be affected in areas These VFR operations must be restored said Andy Cebula AOPA senior vice president of Government and Technical Affairs testifying before the House aviation subcommittee In addition to the business losses caused by the continuing restrictions Cebula said that individual aircraft owners were facing average fixed costs of a month whether the aircraft flies or not See AOPA Online whatsnewnewsitemsxhtml CONGRESSMEN INTRODUCE VFR RESTORATION BILLS House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Don Young RAlaska introduced Wednesday aviation security legislation that includes a provision that requires that any notam regulation or order that restricts the ability of Part aircraft to conduct operations in ECB airspace shall cease to be in effect days after the bill is passed This provision is similar to the bill also introduced Wednesday by Rep Bob Filner DCalif that would require the FAA to develop a plan to allow VFR flight in the remaining ECB areas where it is currently prohibited Filner said his legislation requires the FAA to have a specific timeline for opening up these closed airports National security is paramount but we must also find a way to allow this backbone of American transportation to resume flying FAA MAY GRANT PROFICIENCY INSPECTION EXTENSIONS As a followup to informal discussions with FAA officials AOPA formally requested that pilots and aircraft owners directly affected by the enhanced Class B flight restrictions and the TFRs be given relief from the regulations governing instrument proficiency flight reviews and certain aircraft inspections In particular AOPA asked that the FAA extend the due date to November for those whose pilot proficiency or aircraft inspections were due on or after September Relief was also requested on behalf of our military personnel serving overseas The FAA recently told AOPA that granting the requested relief was possible with certain modifications A final decision is expected early next week See AOPA
