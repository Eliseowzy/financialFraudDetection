Subject Bloomberg just in case you havent read this one Enron Falls Amid Concern Debt Threatens Dynegy Bid Update By Stacie Babula Houston Nov Bloomberg Enron Corp shares and bonds dropped after the energy trader disclosed debts of billion due by suggesting a takeover by Dynegy Inc may not happen soon enough to save the company from bankruptcy Shares of Enron fell or percent to in late morning trading Enrons percent notes due in July were bid at cents on of face value and offered at cents down more than percent from yesterday traders said Enron whose shares plunged percent this year as accounting errors led to earnings restatements a federal investigation and a management shakeup said it has less than billion in cash or credit lines Dynegy plans to complete its buyout by October and Enron may have to ask its lenders to restructure payment schedules to survive This filing shows that Enron is in a precarious financial situation said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade who rates Enron shares hold and doesnt own them They have to stay afloat for the Dynegy deal to go through and that now looks difficult Dynegy agreed Nov to buy Enron in a transaction now valued at billion in stock and assumed debt The difference between Dynegys offer for Enron and the price of Enron shares widened to more than percent from percent yesterday Bloomberg data show Its become more clear that the chances of this deal going through arent percent but much closer to fiftyfifty said Edward Paik who helps manage the Liberty Utilities Fund with million Enron shares Theres just so much information that is unknowable about Enrons financial position he said SEC Filing Last week Enron Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley said the company has billion invested in noncore businesses including broadband and the Dabhol power plant in India Whalley said Enron will sell those business to pay down debt Enron expects to get billions from the sales Whalley said without being more specific Enron wouldnt comment on whether it could sell assets fast enough to keep current on its debts Asset sales valued at about million are expected close by the end of this year the company said yesterday in its thirdquarter filing with the Securities Exchange Commission Most of the billion in debt is due before the end of the third quarter when the Dynegy buyout is scheduled to close according to the SEC filing Dynegy and ChevronTexaco Corp which owns percent of Dynegy may have to help Enron win refinancing agreements with its lenders said Kathleen Vuchetich who helps manage the billion Strong American Utilities Fund which is percent Dynegy shares I never dreamt the billion in debt due would be that large coming due all at once Vuchetich said It calls into question their decision to schedule it that way in the first place Enron yesterday reduced thirdquarter results by cents a share bringing the periods loss to cents or million according to the SEC filing On Nov Enron lowered earnings back to by million to reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the books That included a thirdquarter reduction of million A drop in Enrons senior unsecured debt rating to BBB by Standard Poors on Nov may force Enron to pay off a million note by Nov if it doesnt find collateral to guarantee the debt taken on by an affiliated partnership the company said in the filing Without repayment or collateral investors in a partnership that owns Brazilian naturalgas assets can begin to liquidate the partnerships assets Enron said The company said its working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and take debt off its books Its shares plunged this year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were being used to hide losses from failed investments Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said last month that buying back million shares from two such partnerships cost Enron shareholders billion in lost equity Fourth Quarter Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing affiliated partnership may cut Enrons fourthquarter earnings Enron said Enron is obligated to back Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock Because Enrons stock has plunged it may have to write down its assets by million the filing said ChevronTexaco the secondlargest US oil company is providing billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout It provided the first billion a week ago Shares of ChevronTexaco based in San Francisco rose to in midmorning trading Dynegy fell cents to Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston Enrons Lay admitted last week that failed investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to Dynegy Before the buyout was announced Enron stock had fallen percent this year
