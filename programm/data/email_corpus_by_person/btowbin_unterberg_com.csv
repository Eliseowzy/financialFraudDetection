ruled to breakup Mr Softee MSFT sold off initially after being up small on the day but is trading up over as I write this PM NY Time Gates is defiant and feels that things will go his way on appeal he might be right but given Mr Bills penchant for seeming arrogant it was abit odd to see him as the front man dismissing questions about the naming of the second company as if it were completely out of the realm of possibility A more tempered less emotional less personal response might have been abit more comforting for stockholders many people feel Mr Bills hubris got them into this mess to begin with look at INTC and CSCO they know when to tip their hat at Uncle Sam and stay out of the court room The key is the restrictions which are supposed to go into effect in days Gates feels very very very very confident that they will be thrown out and Mr Softee will suffer no harm during the appeal evidentially many after hours traders share his view They seem unconcerned of the threat to the new MSFT net strategy which is to be announced at the end of June In the broader markets it was a reversal of yesterday with financials and tech on the rebound IBM ORCL HWP SUNW C BAC AXP LEH BSC AMTD and

to breakup Mr Softee MSFT sold off initially after being up small on the day but is trading up over as I write this PM NY Time Gates is defiant and feels that things will go his way on appeal he might be right but given Mr Bills penchant for seeming arrogant it was abit odd to see him as the front man dismissing questions about the naming of the second company as if it were completely out of the realm of possibility A more tempered less emotional less personal response might have been abit more comforting for stockholders many people feel Mr Bills hubris got them into this mess to begin with look at INTC and CSCO they know when to tip their hat at Uncle Sam and stay out of the court room The key is the restrictions which are supposed to go into effect in days Gates feels very very very very confident that they will be thrown out and Mr Softee will suffer no harm during the appeal evidentially many after hours traders share his view They seem unconcerned of the threat to the new MSFT
