<3470405.1075840065684.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-02-14 01:33:00, I am wakened by the approaching chatter of the early morning call to prayer sounding a bit like the fuss made by one of those cartoon balls of fighting dogs and cats From the minarets of far away mosques the muezzins cries ricochet through Istanbuls still dark alleys and streets Seagulls who have drifted up the hill from the Golden Horn squawk contentedly outside my window From somewhere down below a miserable dog joins into the predawn ruckus soon followed by the local muezzin whose amplified singing drowns out all the rest He reminds us that God is great and that prayer is a whole lot more important than sleep at least thats what Ive been told he sings in Arabic Because my religion thinks more highly of sleep I feel free to simply listen while gently trying to pull the warm blanket of sleep back over me The muezzin has a beautiful voice Its rise and fall stitches itself into the edges of a dream in which a former best friend and I argue about the rules of a game of miniature golf hanging just out of reach Slowly the banal calculations that fill my days begin to crowd their way into my head Its about a quarter to six I figure which means theres time for a bit of writing or even Turkish vocabulary before I douse myself in the shower to full consciousness I remind myself of the theory that one can write most freely while still intoxicated with sleep or just plain intoxicated am immediately stricken with the fear I am incapable of such freedom take a look round my brain for something worth writing about find nothing hypothesize about the advantages of a quick dash into the hallway to turn on the gas heater so that when I really get up it will be reasonably warm out there wonder if I really do have enough stuff prepared to fill up the two hours of my English lesson with Suleyman conclude that all this thinking has probably made any more sleep impossible then I realize later fall back to sleep My new phone is hooked up and I have a new internet server which will make it much easier to keep in touch Hope to attack that backlog of responses that are due Keep in touch MarkO Get Your Private Free Email at 
<12095708.1075840065920.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-04-05 21:20:00,Cc This is the first day of the Kurban Bayram Holiday of the Sacrifice and Istanbuls streets are full of folks in their holiday best And blood For days cows lambs goats rams and other big animals have been being brought to Istanbul from the countryside I read that in Cairo you could see people bringing their animals in by cab Tent cites consisting of rickety structures of unlumbered wood and huge plastic tarps full of these doomed animals have sprung up under bridges in garbage filled lots and along the highways The citys normal perfume of car exhaust and coal fumes is now mixed with the heavy smells of the barnyard And today the slaughter began Pools of blood and rain spotted the pavement in front of my building evidence of a recent butchering On a muddy hillside in one of the older neighborhoods south of the Halic Golden Horn in Eski Old Istanbul I saw several women all smiling surrounding a man vigorously chopping away at the rib cage of a cow with an ax The cows recently skinned hide was spread out neatly beside them the rest of the animal in a heap nearby I passed three men loading sagging plastic sacks no doubt full of the spoils of a recent kill into the trunk of a car Sorry but my weak imagination couldnt help but conjure up to images from Scorceses Goodfellas By a mosque three was a lone Rams head under a tree Its snout was pointing upwards as if thinking about stretching a neck that was no longer there to the leaves just above it On the sidewalk in front of a butcher shop a man hacking off the skin of a decapitated lamb rolled the body back and forth like a water balloon A few meters away a pen full of sheep ate their feed contentedly from a trough I looked closely at them was surprised to see that they seemed oblivious to the significance of what was going on right next to them Mounds of entrails lay in the gutter of one street I walked bye the opening of a narrow alley from which I was assaulted by a draft bloated with the now unpleasant order of fresh meat Later I watched with absolutely no idea what it meant a young man put his fingers into the blood runoff of one butchering then walk to his car and wipe it on the license plate The Kurban Bayram is an extremely important holiday for Moslems second only Ramadon Ramazon in Turkish Its the time for the hajj hac in Turkish or pilgrimage to Mecca which all Moslems of any means are to make at least once in their lifetimes Here in Turkey most folks get at least two days off work some the entire week During the holiday throughout the Moslem world many families buy an entire animal for sacrifice using only a part of it themselves giving the bulk of it to others including most importantly the poor Some play amateur butcher but I have been told the vast majority of them have an expert do it Indeed the Koran demands that the sacrifice be as quick and painless as possible The holiday itself celebrates the Old Testament story in which Ibrahim Abraham to nonMoslems was ordered by God to sacrifice his son Abraham reluctantly agreed but was given a last minute reprieve and was allowed to sacrifice a ram instead It is a powerful story about belief and faith and must give animal rightists a few textual problems I can see why Moslems have picked the story out as paramount It certainly provides an interesting contrast to the New Testament story of Gods sacrifice of his son As I walked around Istanbul today I overwhelmed The city was a slaughterhouse full of for me somewhat gruesome contrasts Young girls in flowered dresses and boys in tiny threepiece suits ran around the streets laughing and playing games with blood on their shoes I passed a curious boy kicking at some unfortunate creatures stomach which had been left on a pile of garbage I saw a little girl holding her mothers hand smiling at me shyly as her mom picked through a pile of discarded intestines April My discontent at the sights of the Kurban I concluded later was a bit sanctimonious Americans eat considerable more meat than Turks its only that in the United States the dismemberment is done quite a bit more discretely But why should it be Isnt it a better or at least a lot more honest to understand what the animal part and animal youre eating looked like when it was still alive including rippling muscles forlorn gaze and all I thought of my canoe trips to Canada and how much more meaningful my fish dinner was because I had caught and cleaned the unlucky critter myself A sharpening of reality I think is always a good thing especially in this time when so much of our knowledge and experience comes secondhand through the media including I have to reluctantly admit my beloved books If our rituals often the most powerful means of creating realityblindness can be infused with as much truth as possible all the better Id say Then perhaps when those flimsy dreams we try to kid ourselves with disintegrate like pieces of wet toilet paper Today is the fivemonth anniversary of my arrival here in Istanbul Its an amazing thing Ive done for myself I think I am as close to totally engaged in my life and the world around me as I have ever been It will be hard to live any other way again I imagine In the last week and a half three terrorists here in Turkey succeeded only in blowing themselves up much I suppose to their martyred souls chagrin Ive got to hope that these crazy acts are evidence of the PKK or whomever being on its last legs There are important elections national and local coming up on April th so well probably get a chance to see just how long those legs are Hope all is well Drop me a line MarkO Get Your Private Free Email at

<16620439.1075840066040.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-06-23 02:01:00, Home A sort of honor not a building site Wherever we are when if we chose we might Be somewhere else but trust that we have chosen right WH Auden The view from my living room a southern view begins with a mess of red tiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic Golden Horn On the other side of the Halic a riverharbor once beautiful and fast flowing now stalled and polluted are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium later to be called Constantinople later still Istanbul was founded nearly six centuries before the birth of Christ Above a cement colored smear of apartment buildings of much more recent vintage I can make out the outlines of towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the s AD I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques built in the s during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman Suleyman the Magnificent Otherwise the hillsides of Eski Old Istanbul are covered by the before mentioned apartment buildings relatively new but already appearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement They are I suppose full of people who for the most part work far too much for far too little and who must wonder more and more with each passing day about the relevance of their muezzins cries Incongruously hundreds maybe thousands of sea gulls screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters dip and rise in the air space between me and all of that I recently bought a cheap guitar I left a better one back in the States from my friend Ilyas and from time to time I sit looking out my window while playing sad songs from Americas south the easiest kind to play slow with three chords and as Bono pretentiously said the truth This evening I did just that singing and playing among others a song by Steve Earle in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long ago love Was I off somewhere or maybe just too high and one by Lucinda Williams who sings about hitting the road in order to forget When I get to Baton Rouge I wont cry a tear for you A pile of clouds staacked up on the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset but the invisible sun still makes its presence know bordering them crimson I watch the neddlelike vapor trail of a jet crawl west until it too disappears behind the clouds all the time wondering about when I too will be heading in that same direction What will it be like to be in America again I dont think Ive ever developed particularly deep psychic connections with places though that is not to say I havent loved the places Ive lived I truly adore San Francisco and I always come to Dallass defense I appreciate Aurora Illinois and miss Westfield New Jersey often wondering what it would have been like to have finished my growing up there But because perhaps I ultimately value experience more than comfort and dont get me wrong I value comfort a great deal maybe I havent been able to convince myself at some critical fundamental level to believe that settling down in one place or come to think of it with one person for the rest of my life is an ultimate goal Of course I worry about where this all might lead with the specter of absolute and perhaps God forbid unbearable loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility But then again maybe Im just looking for the ultimate home and will burrow in deeply once Ive found it My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home after what was for me at least a wonderful tenday visit They werent so sure about the Boza a sweet slightly fermented drink made from millet I accosted them with at a tiny caf in the center of Eski Istanbul but they tried it anyway Later forgetting about how scared I had been the first time I was there I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on a postdusk walk through the working class Kucuk Pazar neighborhood on our way to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the Suleymaniye Mosque While passing through Kucuk Pazar we turned into one particularly poorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in near total darkness I could only tell they were smoking by the occasional flare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes After first not knowing what in the world wed stumbled onto I realized we were passing near a hamam Turkish public bath no doubt an immensely important institution in Kucuk Pazar as many of the apartments there I have been told have no showers Notwithstanding these and a few other nonstarters I still think Misha and Ninas trip was a success We did and saw a lot albiet while suffering through the hot humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer Probably of most significance to me was checking in with Misha after nearly nine months apart We had much to talk about or at least to allude to vaguely During one of our more memorable ie ridiculous jaunts into these wordy nevernever lands which occurred on the roof porch of my building and lasted until four in the morning Misha was patient and courteous when I suggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood space between an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understand department In response I referred to some of the books Ive read This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons though I plan on studying Turkish a lot for example translating newspaper articles and writing and with the help of Ismail and Sukran trying to absorb more deeply all that I have learned to date And I have learned a lot including an incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary Still I wonder if this old dog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where to lay down afterwards My biggest problem among many I know is hearing Turkish My two most used sentences are Ne dediniz What did you say and Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz Can you say that again I will be buying a television ugh as Ive concluded that a television is an important way to learn how to hear Turkish Most importantly this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writing program writing for a least three hours a day five days a week Insallah With gods help That coupled with work and Turkish and my reading should keep me pretty busy and hopefully productive At least I should be sending a few more emails More later MarkO Get Your Private Free Email at

Thanks again for the communication Like I said in earlier note things seem pretty normal Stores without electricty but open No one seems to be hoarding Indeed except for lack of electricity I really wouldnt know anything happened and I walked around for a couple hours covering some ground It was strange but I had great trouble getting to sleep last night and probably only did so minutes before the quake Next couple hours was spont outdoors with the rest of my neighbors Took a pretty good walk then too and again saw little damage though admittedly it was the middle of the night The one good thing is that for the first time in my stay here the stars were all out as the city had gone dark Quite an experience More later Mark From To Mark Skilling Subject UPDATE before heading home for the night am CDT TUES Date Tue Aug Dear Mark Just finished the late news its past midnight herebut wanted to check in one last time and will monitor the internet here at work for future communications from you as they become possible Mom and Dad are on following this online as well I called them the minute the bulletins started coming across on the earthquake and Mom saw it on television shortly afterward We had CNN video of some of the victims on our midnight news tonight so were just starting to see what has happened there AP is now saying at least are dead and reporting that at least buildings in Istanbul have crumbled I guess Izmit miles east of you in Instabulyoull know where these cities are has been hardest hit with of the deaths there And an oil refinery is said to be on fire in the city of Bursa where six are reported dead If this story is like so many others at this point were only starting to get the picture It sounds like a messand the aftershocks are always said to be frightening Were all very concerned about you after this Markbut I cant begin to tell you how relieved we were to hear from you I hope youre really all right We know communications are apt to be sporadic in coming days but well await word on how youre doingI couldnt get over the fact you were able to get through to us so quickly I know battery power for your laptop is at a premium and that youll be carefully using your PCproviding the phone lines hold uptheyre saying there are a lot of lines down I didnt realize Istabul was so biga city of million learned that on the wires but have no idea how sophisticated or well equipped the Turkish rescue teams are nor how extensive the damage has beenwill food become short when will electricity be restored etc Were concerned about you Mark Please be careful and take care of yourself and communicate as youre able Youre on our minds We love you Mark Will close for nowbut will keep in touch Tom Reply Separator Subject Re earthquakeare you all right Author Mark Skilling at InternetTCO Date PM Just got on line Surprised it was possible Electricity out so probably only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up Everything ok here so far Got a pretty good shake Was out in the streets for a couple of hours with everyone else My neighborhood up on solid rock so things looked mostly ok Lots of old and bad construction here stones

<23700747.1075840066307.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-08-20 01:36:00,August The afternoon ezan is as if a lament The muezzins voice seems fuller more emotional and he sings strong and slow Because the electricity in my neighborhood had been off most of the day apparently as a precaution against fire it was the first amplified call to prayer I have heard today But it is not for us he wails My neighborhood has been relatively untouched some fallen masonry an empty top floor apartment overlooking the square surrounding the Galata Tower half collapsed debris from it partially blocking the road that circles the square Thousands are suspected dead in an incredible series of earthquakes the first a possible and unfathomable on the Richter scale that began this morning at Images on the TV are horrific a five story building off its foundation leaning against the building next to it a warehouse its roof collapsed on fire the top half of a minaret toppled a bridge severed neatly into four parts collapsed Worse yet dozens of apartment buildings flattened into cruel piles of concrete beams and slabs twisted steel reinforcement and rubble A handsome father breaks down in the arms of friends in front of one such monstrosity At another a reporter shoves her microphone into a hole under a concrete beam interviews someone trapped there the camera then panning back to show an impossible heap of debris above I had trouble getting to sleep last night which was unusual Ismail and I had spent a fine evening at one of our favorite outdoor cafs under trees whose leaves were gently tussled by a breeze coming down the Bosphorus Nearby was the impressive bulk of the Nusretiye Mosque built by Sultan Mahmut the Second some years ago to celebrate his victory over the corrupt Janissary a kind of special guard to the Sultan We spoke of writing of nationalism about my upcoming trip to the States about learning a new language about a possible trip together in the winter along the coast of the Aegean Sea We were both particularly buoyant with the worst of the summer heat and humidity seemingly behind us In retrospect it was as if we were summing some things up a minor period in our lives over a new one soon to begin I returned home around midnight lay in my bed mulling absurdly over possible problems that might arise on trips that are many weeks away The last time I looked at my watch it was well after am It seemed that something woke me up other than the shaking though Im not sure It may have been dogs barking a person yelling or the birds Perhaps it was simply the first gentle movements of the quake triggering deeply imbedded memories and fears from the quake I experienced in San Francisco I was up out of my bed though still half a sleep before it got really bad There was a crazy mess of sounds from wood and metal and whatever squeaking and creaking around me The movement and sounds confused me at first and I remember thinking for a moment or two that there were other people in my place and that this was the problem Soon however there was no question what was happening By then I was in my hallway where three doorways were close together The first moments of a serious earthquake when you are up in a building are as if the earth below is swelling the building riding those swells like waves Then it gets awful out of control and it is nothing at all like the comfort of riding waves I felt the sickening feeling of my building being all too easily whipped around from side to side and otherwise Though it was dark the ceilings walls and floors all seemed at absurd new angles visavis each other The shaking was bad enough I could imagine that things might start collapsing From time to time I darted out of the relatively safety of the hallway to grab my sweats a jacket my bag Soon the shaking stopped I heard it lasted some seconds and then I really started racing to get outside I must have been soaked with adrenaline by this point remembering to grab my Turkish dictionary a flashlight which unfortunately wasnt assembled I did that later and I had to root around the drawer for the batteries some extra cash even my camera The electricity stayed on for a bit which was helpful but was off by the time I opened my door a minute or two later My place is five stories up on the top floor and theres a veranda off to one side Perhaps unwisely though I couldnt resist I went out on it for a quick look out over the city It was dark except for a moving light here and there the headlights of cars Something may have been burning across the Golden Horn in the Balat neighborhood I could see the silhouettes of a few of the great Mosques against a sky now full of beautiful stars Below a car alarm had gone off and people were yelling and shouting I worked my way carefully down the stairs concerned that they may have collapsed I spent most of the next two or three hours with the crowd that had gathered in the relative safety of the square around the Galata Tower though I occasionally shot a worried look up at that huge mass looming above us At one point I took a long walk further up my hill then along Istiklal Caddesi my part of the citys main street Other than the electricity being out and the people on the streets there was little physical evidence of the earthquake Some masonry had fallen As I mentioned above an abandoned apartment was half collapsed near my place I saw no one hurt But I did saw people in their underwear a women mumbling about Mohammed in one hand a water bottle the other with its palm turned up to the sky which as I said was starry Some people were laughing others were crying most were huddled together in small groups talking quietly Many of the women were wearing headscarves more than usual it seemed An outdoor caf next to the tower opened and served tea and water I knew a few people there and with my poor Turkish learned that in was really bad in Izmit sixty of so miles east of here that even here in Istanbul a few buildings may have collapsed Dawn came and I returned to my apartment slept for a few hours That sleep was interrupted and made fitful by what I learned later were a series of fairly significant aftershocks On the television a crowd just burst into applause A young boy has been rescued from one collapsed building Except for being dusty he appears unscathed As they carry him to an ambulance a reporter follows asking him questions Were you scared Cok kokum very scared He seems pleased to be back in the world by the attention hes getting Then he is asked about his family His eyes grow wide his face long Annem my mother kardesim my sisterbrother sesleri duydum I heard their voices Duydum By the time they reach the

lot of good questions The best indication my building is ok is that its standing and that its contemporaires are all standing as well You may have read that the buildings that fell for the most part are of new vintage and are in the lowlands Mine is neither Spoke to my landlord today who is an engineer of some sort and for what its worth he said the building is a good one About shots I got all ones recommended by my doctor before I left SF though he wasnt planning for one of the worst natural disasters in our time Im keeping my eye out about the how and why of the spread of the diseases theyre worried about here but am pretty sure that one cirterion is that you have to be pretty darn close which Im not Im not our sticking my nose into anything though would love to see things up close for curiositys sake Trouble is Id just be getting in the way which I dont want to do So will for now restrict myself to giving a little cash and observing what goes on here on the home front The damage really is not apparent from here As I mentioned in my note to dad things are pretty darn normal Expect indirect impact to be visable like worsening inflation for example But thats about it Will keep an eye out for trouble though More later Thanks again for taking the time to write Its always nice to hear from you Love Mark From To Mark Skilling Subject Thanks for the wonderful updates and stay safe and healthy Date Sat Aug Mark Thank YOU for your notes Had we not heard from you our lives here would have proceeded in terror We wouldnt know where to begin trying to find you and the troubles there seem so far flung and numerous that Im sure no on in authority could have taken the time to help They have their hands full The fact that your building held up and that were not looking on helplessly like the poor devils we see on television must do knowing loved ones are dying or dead beneath mounds of shattered concrete underscores Moms lucky star notiona comment we made to each other as we talked earlier today I am relieved to hear you are able to obtain food Theyre saying disease is spreading in the wake of thisespecially with the heat thats underway Please Mark be careful Your accounts of events there are extraordinary but Id rather have you safe and well then threatened by illness or harm at the hands of these aftershocks were hearing about The wire services are reporting the official death toll at but add that are missing beneath the rubble many presumed dead Concern about the spread of disease is being raised not only because of decaying corpses under building but because of the number of people forced to sleep outdoors without toilets or proper sanitation The water is a source of concern Its appearing this may rival the s quake there said to have killed I dont know much about the spread of disease or the way you protect yourself against its spread I presume you were innoculated before going over Mark If not can you get shots anywhere now Your accounts are extraordinary and you give us insight into the environment which preceded and followed this debacle Please be careful Mark Id rather have you healthygiven a choice between that and news of whats happening there Are you satisfied your building is safe to return to Will food become a problem as this situation continues Also what happens when the weather starts turning colderwhere are all the homeless going to live It doesnt sound like the authorities there can get a handle on something this widespread and devastatingat least not anytime in the near future at least Thanks for all the news Markand please be careful and take care of yourself Im not sure exactly what we can do for you from this distance but I did see Jeffs email offering to help through Enron shipments Will close nowits midnight Friday night and Im seeing double nothing new about that right Youre in all of our thoughts Mark Love Tom Reply Separator Subject Re Concern about you from back homeTHURSDAY evening PM Author Mark Skilling at InternetTCO Date AM Tom Thanks again fro your thoughtful notes Cant say life normal but in areas without damage not to far away from it Plenty of food No hoarding Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normal loads on a daily basis just like before Of course things will be taxed by the demands of the rescue and restoration but looks like the suffering will be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones And what a lot of suffering that will be Do have access to my building It is on solid ground and is older which in Turkey ironically means safer Still spent two of the last three nights sleeping outside with millions of others Again my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me Sukran too and have been able to enjoy his and his friends company On these nights every open space not too close to a building seems to be filled with people sleeping on blankets jackets etc Some have strung string between things trees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets made relatively cozy little spots for themselves It continues to amaze me how kind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here though I did hear of one poor old fellow got his shoes stolen perhaps he simply absent mindely misplaced them Everyone though is tramatized tired and sad And what you read about impact on attempts to get economy which has been hit hard by Russian crisis going unfortuantely appear right on the mark Wish Turkey all the luck in the world It will need it Able to watch the local news though obviously dont understand a lot of what theyre saying Still the pictures tell enough More later Nice to know youre thinking about me Let dad and mom know not taking any chances that werent there already Love Mark From To Subject Concern about you from back homeTHURSDAY evening PM cdt Date Thu Aug Dear Mark We continue to follow your emails and the news reports on the earthquke disaster there Wanted to drop you a note before heading home for the night Im concerned about your well being and wondering if youve daredor have been allowedback in your apartment News reports here indicate many are sleeping outsideand being encouraged to do so by the goverment there who fears buildings have been weakened and may succomb to powerful afterschocks Reportedly the Kandilli Observatory there reported aftershocks in just hours today Thursday Reports were getting here put the death toll at with injured The UN says are still buried and feared dead and its experts are saying most who are saved after a disaster like this are saved in the first hoursits been at least hours as I write this to you They say the smell of decomposing bodies is flooding some sections of the countrys hardest hit cities and that there is fear of spreading disease I see the US has ordered Marines and Navy sailors in and told them to step up rescue efforts Were also told something like countriesincluding Israel Germany France Britain and Japan are dispatching rescue teams and equipment The news wires and television reports are covering other US rescuers who are heading over but fear its too late It sounds from your emails like your neighborhood escaped the worst of the damage But I wonder how safe you feel your building is after the shake it endured Also wonder whether you can get adequet food and water and whether phone and electrical service is regular and reliable I cant tell you how relieved we were to receive the quick communication minutes the other night Wed have been worried sick about your wellbeing Clearly news reports center on the hardest hit areasso its hard to picture how normal your life is in the wake of the quake There is real concern being expressed on our news here about how the masses left homeless by this disaster are going to be housed in the coming cold seasonwhich isnt all that far away I also saw a notation on one of the wire stories that recent economic movestermed fairly severe in news reportsby the government there to get inflation under control made this an especially inoportune time for this disaster to hit Hope youre doing all right Mark and I join Dad in urging care I guess they had a point something quake north of SFO just the other evening and the disaster there has the earthquake concerns in vulnerable parts of this country very much in the news The Turkey quake has led national news here since it

your two recent emails as I have all of them Had gone to the Tribune web site something Id done before in order to show my friends here your picture and brag a bit looking for info on percepctive section but probably due to my bad searches didnt unearth it You explanation was very important Also important were your comments on what struck you about what Ive been writing Those kind of comments are the best kind Often when writing its hard to know what works and what doesnt work Perhaps the most important thing however is that the article will be published by Tom Skillings brother Though nothings been published yet and I shouldnt write as if thats a certainty afraid of bad luck would never had gotten close to this opportunity without you Im very grateful Love you and looking forward to both of us experiencing how this ol newspaper media machine works something with which I guess you are all to familiar MarkO From To Mark Skilling Subject ITS FABULOUS Date Wed Aug Mark My read on this is that its terrific You personalize this tragedy in a way only one familiar with the area and its people can You take me through the whole experience in a way Ive not visited the subject before Im not an editorbut it strikes me that this is just the sort of insight into a calamatous event of our day that the Tribune seeks in its Perspective section Editing is always a devil and I suspect you are a lot better at it than I amknowing the subject as completely as you do You probably are right that introducing the reader right up front to the notion this is about the unimaginable tragedy about which weve been hearing for days now is a good idea But my sense is that youve infused this piece with an on the ground and there feel which can only come from one uniquely familiar with this devastated city and region Youre definitely on the right track Mark Congratulations It will be interesting to how the Perspective people feel I think theyre going to be pleased What a job Thanks for sharing this with me Mark Look forward to hearing how this proceeds As Ive said before youre introducing me to a place and events with which I have no personal familiarity After reading your work I feel a kinship with the people and place and the misery thats been imposed on them and it by nature Fascinating Love you Mark This is no easy assignmentyet youve done a beautiful job in trying circumstances Again congratulations Tom Reply Separator Subject no subject Author Mark Skilling at InternetTCO Date AM Dear Bill Hope all is well The piece which is cut and pasted in below is a too long now at some words The first paragraph could go I suppose though I think it gets in some historical information that has not been in anything else Ive been reading Also I think it is important that Turkey has for many years been caught in a tremendous struggle accommodating its rich cultural heritage with the demands of the present Its fair to say that this struggle is one of the main reasons I first became interested in Turkey The present suffered a huge setback with the quake in that not only did the modern secular government fail terribly but so did the modern buildings That the repairs to the old city wall crumbled but the not ancient wall itself seems an apt symbol of this Maybe the stuff on San Francisco can go though I guess it is interesting that I lived through both experiences Also the paragraph about prequake hospitality is not really necessary Perhaps a more general pruning job rather than the crude removal of entire paragraphs would do the job Then again you will probably have all together different ideas I look forward to working with you all on this Mark From my living room I look down a hill over a collection of red tiled rooftops to the Golden Horn This river once beautiful and fast flowing is now stalled and polluted On the other side of the Golden Horn are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium later to be called Constantinople later still Istanbul was founded some thousand years ago Above a cement colored smear of apartment buildings of much more recent vintage I can make out the outlines of towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the sixth century nearly thousand years ago They are now rotten with age though parts had recently been rebuilt for tourists Some of these restored parts collapsed during last Tuesdays earthquake The ancient parts were left untouched Less than a block away is the minaret of our small neighborhood mosque From here you can hear five times a day its ezan or call to prayer That call is now as if a lament The muezzins voice seems fuller more emotional than usual He sings in Arabic which I dont understand but Ive read that his call reminds the believers that God is most great and tells them to Come to prayer come to prosperity I listen carefully for signs of doubt about Gods mercy and compassion But I detect no doubt at all Instead it is simply beautiful and sad and despite not understanding what he sings very moving In the past few days I have heard many sad tired people say automatically and surprisingly without bitterness that Allah verir Allah alir God gives God takes away And much has been taken away The death toll from last Tuesdays earthquake is likely to exceed with an equal number injured Up to have been left homeless Millions more in the days immediately following the quake chose to sleep outdoors including me afraid of the aftershocks All over Istanbul in the parks and squares even on narrow medians between busy streets entire families spent the days and nights on blankets spread out on the ground In the grassy Hippodrome along side the spectacular Blue Mosque and in the gardens between that same mosque and the Sancta Sophia where you would normally expect hundreds of tourists to be milling about it was as if a great migration was taking place Many of the women wore brightly colored headscarves Other women despite the heat were dressed from head to toe in more somber black Some families brought portable propane burners to make the their beloved tea Many more had lugged along pillows and mattresses others string and rope which they strung between trees and posts and hung sheets for a bit of privacy On the nights immediately after the quake I was grateful to receive an invitation to join my friend Ismails family and the family of a friend of his to spend the night in a little park in the hills above the Bosphorus Bridge The Bosphorus Bridge is a huge modern suspension bridge connecting Europe and Asia that looks like a gray version of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco With the bridges hulk looming seemingly helplessly below us I shared a corner of a colorful Turkish blanket covering the ground We drank tea smoked cigarettes and joked about being gocebe nomads and about the Turks finally returning to their forgotten nomadic roots I practiced my Turkish with the children who unlike most older Turks were able to correct me in English During the night while I slept someone put a jacket over me Now that the rains and cooler weather have come and the experts have given an allclear sign most of us have returned to our homes Back in my apartment I glance at my walls at my ceilings find it impossible not to think of all those still buried underneath theirs Last night at our favorite tea garden I joined Ismail and his wife Dilek who had just learned that three of her cousins had died in Adapazari We talked about whether people here will ever be able to forget return to something of a normal life It hadnt started raining yet so we stayed late admitted to being a bit nervous about returning home The government and the army are being severely criticized in the local press and on the streets as are the construction contractors There have been other problems as well In an open area near the caf I mentioned above where dozens of families had come to spend the night an old man had his shoes stolen I was told the story of a Turk in Yalova one of the hardest hit areas selling bottled water for million TL dollars ten times the normal price That profiteer however was apparently beaten subsequently by the storyteller himself while a nearby policeman did nothing to intervene Yet notwithstanding the widespread and no doubt legitimate anger at the official response that of ordinary Turks has been overwhelming and impressive A large truck from my relatively poor working class neighborhood was quickly filled with needed supplies water bread medicine and sent to one disaster site The company of one of my students sent along a similar truckload of supplies and has now set up a fund to collect money for the homeless The same is true of business group to which the company of a dear friend of mine Sukran belongs Efforts like these have been going on everywhere In addition thousands of people from all over Turkey have gone to the stricken areas to help including Kurds who want to prove their commitment to the Turkish State I recall the criticism I heard after the San Francisco World Series Earthquake which I unfortunately experienced as well Though admittedly a much less serious affair the cries about lax enforcement of building codes were similar Everyone promised to do better and I hope they have I recall my own pathetic plans never implemented to prepare for the next big one I had cut an article out of the paper which listed the emergency supplies that should be kept close on hand Though I kept that list near to the top of my pile of important papers over the years it simply grew yellow and torn I finally threw it away at the time I packed up for my move to Istanbul Significantly before I left San Francisco last fall damage from that quake was still being repaired some ten years later and complaints could still be heard about the governments continuing failure to enforce building codes rigorously enough My experience since coming to Istanbul has been one of almost unending Turkish hospitality I could have been left alone but was not When I first came here on vacation some two years ago I meet a fine man Ilyas who makes Saz a stringed musical instrument that is as important here as the guitar is in America and bought a beautiful one from him When I returned to Istanbul this time to live I visited Ilyas again to say hello and talk about possible Saz lessons When he learned I was looking for an apartment he took most of the next day off and showed me around his neighborhood eventually helping me to find the place I now live The lessons he eventually gave me were free My friend Ismail has spent countless hours with me roaming the city looking for deals on used furniture He and his wife have also lent me a beautiful rug a blanket and several other very useful items in my apartment I occasionally get gifts from my students and never an unkind word from anyone After the earthquake itself several of my Turkish friends kept in constant touch with me Several days ago on the television I saw and heard a crowd burst into applause A young boy had just been rescued from one of the many collapsed buildings Except for being dusty he appeared unscathed As they carried him to an ambulance a reporter followed asking him questions Were you scared Cok korktum very scared He response was perky He was clearly delighted to be back in the world by the attention he was getting Then he was asked about his family His eyes grew wide his face long Annem my mother kardesim my sisterbrother sesleri duydum I heard their voices Duydum By the time they reached the ambulance he was screaming Sesleri duydum Sesleri duydum I hope the rest of the world hears Turkeys cries for help Insallah daha iyi olacak With Gods help things will be better Insallah Turkiye iyi sanslar From all of us good luck August Istanbul Turkey Get Your Private Free Email at Get Your Private Free Email at

strange to think that right now as I write this you are on the set at WGN in the middle of the news program perhaps putting a few finishing touches on your graphics Just as I got up a few minutes ago I got up early which is the best time to get through to the line I share and also because Im excited and at the exact time I turned on the computor there was a flash of lightening outside Then moments later just as a healthy downpour began the muezzin started singing outside This is true no lie I thought to myself I hope there arent any more cosmic coincidences such as a well you know Ill be on line for a bit so maybe well be able to talk on this thing almost as if in person Love Mark From To Mark Skilling Subject Editing etc Date Thu Aug Hi Mark Below is an edited version of your piece Weve got a few questions which Ive indicated parenthetically through the story Most of the editing is designed to tighten things a little And weve reorganized some sentences to clarify meaning This is an interesting moment in the writereditor relationship and I regret that were experiencing it in cyberspace Its hard to show you each change and explain it but hopefully theyll be more or less selfexplanatory if you compare the edited version with a printout of the original story In any case be of good cheer this is not an extraordinary amount of editing Id suggest that you answer our questions and raise any points about editing within the story just as we have done and then email the whole story back Ill try again to call you Friday Youll see some strange characters in the text theyre our computer coding You can safely ignore them I did get through on the fax line and sent you both a contract and a tax form I hope you got them Hayirli isler Bill By Mark Skilling ISTANBULFrom my living room I look down a hill over a collection of red tiled rooftops to the Golden Horn This river once beautiful and fast flowing is now stalled and polluted On the other side of the Golden Horn are the hills where the ancient city Byzantiumlater to be called Constantinople later still Istanbulwas founded some years ago Above a cementcolored smear of apartment buildings of much more recent vintage I can make out the outlines of towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the th Century They are now rotten with age though parts had recently been rebuilt for tourists Some of these restored parts collapsed during last Tuesdays earthquake The ancient parts were left unharmed Weve deleted the following graf because its effect is compromised by the fact that we dont understand the language Less than a block away is the minaret of our small neighborhood mosque From here you can hear five times a day its ezan or call to prayer That call is now as if a lament The muezzins voice seems fuller more emotional than usual He sings in Arabic which I dont understand but Ive read that his call reminds the believers that God is most great and tells them to Come to prayer come to prosperity I listen carefully for signs of doubt about Gods mercy and compassion But I detect no doubt at all Instead it is simply beautiful and sad and despite not understanding what he sings very moving In the last few days I have heard many sad tired people say automatically and surprisingly without bitterness that Allah verir Allah alir God gives God takes away And much has been taken away The death toll from last Tuesdays earthquake is likely to exceed well make this number conform with the best and latest wire service reports we have as of Friday with an equal number injured Up to have been left homeless Millions afraid of the aftershocks including me chose to sleep outdoors All over Istanbul in the parks and squares even on narrow medians between busy streets entire families spent the days and nights on blankets spread out on the ground Usually you would expect hundreds of tourists to be milling about in the grassy Hippodrome alongside the spectacular Blue Mosque and in the gardens between that mosque and the Hagia SophiaBut now it was as if a great migration were taking place Many of the women wore brightly colored headscarves Other women despite the heat were dressed from head to toe in somber black Some families brought portable propane burners to make their beloved tea Many more had lugged pillows and mattresses others string and rope which they strung between trees and posts and used to hang sheets for a bit of privacy On the nights immediately after the quake I was grateful to receive an invitation to join my friend Ismails family to spend the night in a little park in the hills above the Bosphorus Bridge The Bosphorus Bridge is a huge modern suspension bridge connecting Europe and Asia that looks like a gray version of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco With the bridges hulk looming seemingly helplessly i dont understand the bridge was helpless it loomed helplessly below us I shared a corner of a colorful Turkish blanket covering the ground We drank tea smoked cigarettes and joked about being MDULgocebeMDNM nomads and about the Turks finally returning to their forgotten nomadic roots I practiced my Turkish with the children who unlike most adults were able to correct me in English During the night while I slept someone put a jacket over me A week or so later the rains and cooler weather have come and the experts have given an allclear sign most of us have returned to our homes Back in my apartment I glance at my walls at my ceilings and find it impossible not to think of all those still buried underneath theirs Last night at our favorite tea garden I joined Ismail and his wife Dilek who had just learned that three of her cousins had died in Adapazari a town that was leveled by the quake We talked about whether people here will ever be able to forget It hadnt started raining yet so we stayed late a bit nervous about returning home The government the army and construction contractors are being severely criticized in the local press and on the streets for slowness carelessness greed There have been other problems as well weve deleted the following because this problem seems sort of trivial In an open area near the caf I mentioned above where dozens of families had come to spend the night an old man had his shoes stolen I was told the story of a Turk in Yalova one of the hardest hit areas selling bottled water for million TL Turkish lira perhaps times the normal price The profiteer however was subsequently beaten by the storyteller himself while a nearby police officer did nothing to intervene Yet notwithstanding the official response which has inspired widespread anger the response of ordinary Turks has been overwhelming and impressive A large truck from my relatively poor working class neighborhood was quickly filled with needed supplies water bread medicine and sent to one disaster site The company of one of my students sent along a similar truckload of supplies and has now set up a fund to collect money for the homeless Efforts like these have been going on everywhere Thousands of people from all over Turkey have gone to the stricken areas to help including Kurds who want to prove their commitment to the Turkish State I recall the criticism I heard after the San Francisco World Series Earthquake which I unfortunately experienced as well Though admittedly

to autobiography Some of the original atmospherics have lingered and dont necessarily reflect anything about yours truly Later At The Galata Tower Cafe Cigarette smoke ignoring the lazy sweep of an old ceiling fan hangs in the air above me It seems to mock my obsessive rambling thoughts about teaching and writing and learning Turkish and of course HER Take it easy it says with a smirk Relax A phony look of concern clouds it further What about taking a deep breath Surreptitiously I think I take in the recommended breath but the smoke has drifted in closer notices There Isnt that better No I say to myself Dont worry I am not so far gone as to take this internal dialogue thing outside I flick my hand through one particularly annoying cloud of the stuff Now get lost Outside at the base of the ancient Galata Tower kids on their way home from school set off an M I flinch at the explosion which is amplified by the tight dimensions of the square and the old stone walls surrounding it The square itself left in a premature dusk by the huge towers shadow is temporarily emptied of the teenaged mob I stare out the window into the gloom Though only the bottom few meters yards of the tower are visible to me I am aware of its tremendous bulk The tower first built by the Genoese in the s dominates my entire neighborhood the Kuledibi It should remind us all I suppose of the durability of stone and dirt and of the significantly less impressive characteristics of flesh and blood Day and night amused perhaps by the slim activity of this generations version of flesh and blood it stands obdurate unmoved like the leg of a giant one dare not disturb Emboldened by the lack of any official response to the bombing onebyone the would be terrorists or freedom fighters whos to say drift back into the square I suspect the tower isnt nearly half as bothered by these kids budding pyromania as me since it has no doubt been subject to much more serious attacks during its or so year history Seeing that no adult has stormed into the square to reestablish order I brace myself for another blast Maybe Im the only one who really minds Every male in this country does have to serve in the army for eighteen months Perhaps the noise doesnt bother them or maybe they see that this rather serious version of childs play has a practical side to it giving the kids a head start on basic training I am surprised to discover that the waiter Yusuf is standing next to me He has his head thrown back slightly a gesture that has become for my benefit his version of the question More tea He has given up on words as the ones he knows still dont much match the ones I know Evet cay lutfen Bir az sutlu lutfen Yes tea please With a little milk please Never would have guessed that huh And yes I agree and have been told before too many lutfens There are probably other mistakes too but my words seem to get the job done Ill work on perfecting them sonra later Yusuf nods walks away I realize I have my head bent forward a subconscious adjustment I must have made to dodge some of the smoke I see a cat under one of the tables looking up at me It opens its mouth for what I figure is the beginning of a yawn But instead it emits a strange highpitched wail sounding more like a bird than a cat Embarrassed for the poor thing I look away For maybe the first time since I have been coming to this cafe I take a close look around I must be getting more comfortable Dikkat Watch out There are very few other people in the cafe which is surprising given the amount of smoke They are all sitting alone their heads like mine bent forward I suspect that boredom however and not the smoke is the proximate cause Every table is covered with green felt table clothes all of which are seriously spotted with tea stains and cigarette burns In the middle of each table looking like a tiny shrunken crown is a silver ashtray Above the kitchen which is squeezed unnecessarily tight into a corner of the otherwise spacious caf hangs a huge painting of a beach scene from somewhere in the Pacific Once no doubt bright and evocative it has aged and has now almost completely blended into and disappeared amongst the dull wood panels covering the top half of the room The green of the palm trees lining the beach is now so dark it is approaching black The sand probably once pure white is the color of the mud in the streets outside and the sea close to the color of the tea served here There are several boats pictured all pulled up onto the sand but they are now no more than ghosts and indeed look as if someone may have tried to erase them The painting is as changed and distorted as the dreams of those who sit below it absentmindedly stirring their tea their feet crammed into shoes stiff from having walked through too much winter rain their fingernails having long ago surrendered to the dirt now permanently built up under them wearing clothes that didnt smell so bad this morning they couldnt be worn just one more day drinking the cheap tea they can scarcely afford dreaming perhaps of little more than an early spring I sit up in my chair let my head fall back take in a deep breath and surprisingly

<33340097.1075840067026.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-12-28 01:55:00,Cc Ive cut and pasted in below a piece that should be published in the Turkish Daily News the English language paper here later this week Its a first person piece about my experience of a Christmas service here last year a lot of which youll recognize from last year Ugh Im already repeating myself and Ive just started though really had no choice as needed to get it out before the holiday itself Since this year Christmas again fell during the Muslim Holy Month of Ramadan the piece is sort of year neutral Happy holidays MarkO Christmas Day Istanbul The priest mutters his deeply accented English into the microphone which amplifies and further distorts his voice His bluntly pronounced words rebound through the vast freezing hall of Saint Antoine Cathedral They tell a story familiar to me about the Son of God being sent to earth to die for our sins But here in the middle of this enormous Muslim City the story sounds strange and almost subversive And indeed the Christ story is at the center of the great Christian and Muslim divide Muslims accept only that Christ was a prophet sent by God rejecting vehemently that Christ is his son They see Mohammeds prophecy and the Koran as prompted by the need to correct the mistaken elevation by the Gospel of Christ from the flesh to the divine The priest appears relieved to turn things over to an African man who in a bizarre contrast to the priests gold embroidered robe is wearing a big stuffed yellow ski jacket His English is much better as he announces that we are now to sing a hymn The songs words handwritten and in English are flashed up onto a screen by an overhead projector The lyrics are basic There are several identical stanzas that simply invite Jesus to come I grimace slightly when I see that these are followed by a poorly translated chorus which asks for the Son of God to come will be born in our heart I glance over at Ismail a Muslim friend who has come with me to the service He smiles gives me a wink His English is excellent and I am sure he notices the mistake I look around at the rest of the people in the sanctuary The pews are not even a third full This is the first service of the day and is completely in English It will be followed by an Italian and a Turkish one The crowd at the Turkish service Ismail tells me will overflow into the courtyard in front of the Cathedral and will consist mostly of Muslims curious to see a Christmas service Apparently some members of St Antoines permanent congregation are angry about this since many of them will be unable to find a place to sit Some may even being forced to stand out in the cold Christmas Day this year falls within the Muslim holy Month of Ramadan during which the faithful are to fast between sunrise and sunset or more precisely according to the Koran between the times one can discern a white thread from a black one Ramadan is celebrated during the ninth month of the Muslim calendar which is a lunar one in the solar calendar it occurs days earlier each year My day had started well before dawn when I was awoken by our neighborhoods Ramadan drummer who was roaming the streets pounding his drum and hollering at the top of his lungs Since Ramadan began several days ago all over Istanbul similar drummers have been setting out into the streets some as early as am A tradition originating from a time when clocks were less prevalent their aim is to rustle the believers up out of bed in time for them to have a meal before the sun comes up Ramadan is by far the most important religious observance of the year for Muslims Somewhat like the Jewish celebration of Yom Kippur which some say influenced it Ramadan is a period of atonement and forgiveness Total remission of sins can be achieved if one fasts with pure intentions I have been told that in Turkey which is Muslim well over of all the Turks fast during Ramadan That estimate is certainly consistent with what I have seen and heard The majority of the Turks I come in contact tell me they fast The streets of Istanbul are normally full of vendors selling all sorts of food There are noticeably fewer of them now and they are significantly less busy During the day some restaurants are closed many of the rest all but empty I myself have been careful to be respectful and eat only indoors avoiding among other things my usual practice of grabbing a simit a bagel like round of bread and piece of fruit in the morning and eating them on my way to work Ismail leans over and asks if the service is similar to ones in the States I whisper back that I was raised Protestant and had not seen enough Catholic services in my life to say Raised Protestant was really much too strong a word to use My early religious education involved little more than an hour each Sunday down in the basement of the local Presbyterian Church first in Westfield New Jersey later in Aurora Illinois with my twin sister Sue There during our Sunday school class we often struggle for the entire hour to suppress giggling fits to which we only seemed susceptible in church Sitting now in St Antoines I check myself to see if any of those fits still linger am relieved to discover that none do The priest has returned and is now saying something about light being shown into the darkness and about how the darkness was unable to defeat that light The image of a light tiny but robust surrounded by infinite darkness is a particularly powerful one for me today especially given that I am so far from what I am most familiar A new voice the priest had been replaced again asks us to rise The words of Come Let Us Adore Him are projected onto the screen I lean over toward Ismail whisper that this is a very famous song He kids under his breath that perhaps its one of Gods greatest hits I smile straighten back up listen to the song begin There is no choir only a single guitar for accompaniment It takes a while for the congregations singing to build up Though it never becomes particularly loud it is beautiful Eventually I join in too As if something ethereal our voices drift up through the tremendous space that envelops us seeming only to just barely penetrate the thick cold air I am moved by how wonderful our singing sounds and am surprised to feel a tear though already icecold in the corner of my eye Most of the people here are Westerners I suppose and I wonder how many came like me to be reminded of home a few cold foreigners dwarfed by a Cathedral that is itself dwarfed by the immense Moslem city surrounding it For the first time since arriving in Istanbul I feel a bit homesick The song ends The priest returns invites everyone up to take communion Thinking that Ismail might find it interesting I suggest that we walk to the front of the church to watch We do But when we get there I am surprised that our way is blocked by a dozen or so television cameramen who have begun filming the ceremony I had not seen them before and wonder where they might have been hiding Some now with the powerful lights attached to their cameras turned on swing around and start filming those who have remained in the pews An older woman who is kneeling and praying is caught in one of those lights The cameraman moves in closer and is soon no more than a couple feet away With her eyes closed the elderly woman continues her praying I wonder how she can concentrate and indeed if she can But she continues or at least pretends to perhaps seeing it as an act of defiance The cameramen get even bolder and are now moving freely about the church filming others at point blank range Ismail says he does not want to be on the evening news and tells me he will meet me outside I return to my seat and watch the end of communion wrapped up like it is so incongruously in the hectic filming And I wonder how God would view all this his two most successful religions bumping up against each other in such an awkward fashion Which of the many ways these two religions have come up with to worship him would he approve of disapprove This afternoon in Istanbul the few Christians families that live here will be feasting and celebrating with their families and friends perhaps exchanging gifts Early in the evening after the blast of the cannon shots heard all over Istanbul that signal the end of the days Ramadan fasting pious Muslims will sit down to their own postfast celebratory meal the Iftar Later still the mosques will be filled though mostly by men where special Ramadan prayers will be said Istanbul itself is remarkable at least to westerners for the many domes of its huge Ottoman mosques and the hundreds of minarets that spike its skyline as well as the calls to prayer that pierce its urban din five times each day Yet when the day ends throughout Istanbul each of us will fall asleep under the same black sky In him was life and the life was the light of men And the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not Translation from the Bible Praise be to God Lord of the worlds The compassionate the merciful King on the day of reckoning Thee only do we worship and to Thee do we cry for help Guide Thou us on the straight path The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious with whom Thou are not angry and who go not astray

<16318274.1075840067682.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,2000-02-17 00:16:00,Cc I wrote the following last month while I was in Northern Cyprus Hope you enjoy it Maras The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Attached to the rusting chainlink fence I am approaching are several blood red signs on which are stenciled both the black silhouette of the top half of a faceless soldier holding a rifle and a warning in Turkish that Fotograf Cekmek Yasaktir To Take Photographs Is Forbidden The fence no longer quite plumb in the soft sand seems to stumble across the beach eventually ending at a gently lapping Mediterranean There a tangle of wires attached to the fence extends a short way into the surf making anyones effort to outflank it obviously intentional The Turkish soldiers patrolling the nonmans land beyond to the south could thus treat such an intruder I suppose in whatever way they might see fit In the other direction the fence before it has completely left the beach cuts sharply north running in front of the hulks of four empty resort hotels Above them in the deep blue of the predusk sky hangs a crescent moon the same phased moon that graces the flags of both Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus One of the hotels still has the remnants of an identifying sign with just two of its six letter Greek name remaining Another hotel the smallest and no doubt at one time the quaintest has slatted wooden shutters covering the windows and doors leading out to tiny porches Some of the shutters have rusted off their hinges then fallen forward against the porch railings and now point out to sea as if giving urgent warning Others hang limply defeated from a single remaining hinge Most surprisingly every one of the windows I can see in the hotels is either missing or broken I am taken back by such thoroughness given that the most likely motivation was vindictiveness I struggle to find a loftie r one wondering if there was perhaps some valid security consideration such as making these somewhat strategically set buildings unattractive to squatters Maybe though I find this thought the most troubling it ha d been done just for the fun of it The fence I am walking along marks the border between inhabited and uninhabited Maras the Turkish Cypriots name for the town Greek Cypriots call Varosha The uninhabited part has been off limits since the Turkish army invaded Cyprus in Before that invasion the small Turkish Cyprio t minority had lived uneasily amongst the Greek Cypriot majority though in the years since when Cyprus was given its independence by the English periodic outbreaks of intercommunal violence had led to increased segregation and emigration The invasion launched after a coup on the island and another particularly vicious spat of violence eventually put an end to even this limited association as it did the worst of the violence The Turkish army went on to occupy roughly the northern most of the island which was accompanied and followed by one of the last centurys all too familiar mass crossmigrations The northern half is now home to nearly all of the islands Turkish Cypriots close to of the total population The border between the north and south known as the Atilla Line is one of the many UN patrolled blue lines in the world Maras actually falls within Northern Cyprus with the Attila Line further to the south It is controlled now by the Turkish army At the time of the invasion the town had been a thriving up and coming resort town run mostly by Greek Cypriots Indeed all over Cyprus since its independence despite the periodic deadly violence tourism had been booming But here in Maras at least the boom is no more The forty or so thousand Greek Cypriots who once owned ran or otherwise worked there fled in panic before the advancing Turkish army reportedly leaving behind uncleared breakfast dishe s on tables and washing on lines some forgetting to turn off lights that burned on and on for years UN sponsored proximity talks between the North and the South called proximity talks because the negotiating leaders will not met face to face started in New York on December th They are set to continue in Geneva this January st The return of Maras to its former mostly Greek Cypriot owners or more precisely their return to it is no doubt high on this meetings thus far secret agenda as it has been over the years at the many similar though always fruitless negotiations This time around however expectations are running higher than usual primarily because of a positive change in the dynamic between the two sides by far most important sponsor states Turkey and Greece Turkey for example has recently acquired candidacy status within the European Union which commits it to resolving among other things its disputes with EU member Greece Greece o n the other hand has lately suffered a series of embarrassments on the international stage the biggest of which was being caught last February having given sanctuary to fugitive Kurdish separatist leader and terrorist in most peoples minds Abdullah Apo Ocalan Coupled with th e significant good will garnered in the wake of the tremendous assistance Turkey and Greece gave each other after their twin earthquake disasters las t year the two countries just may be willing to push their client states toward a deal The point where the fence meets the sea marks the end of the gentle curve o f the short beach I am walking Behind me at this beachs other end is inhabited Maras nicest hotel oddly sporting an English name the Palm Beach Hotel If you looked in that direction taking in only the fine hotel the attractive beach the dark blue sea you might think you were in a tourist paradise But this is no paradise As I walk the last few feet to the fence I begin to see another beach emerge much longer than the one I am on sweeping south most of the way to the horizon There are more hotels which I knew from what I had read were also empty But my reading has not prepared me for the monstrous proportions of it all First in the distance one two three empty hotels quickly come into view then more slowly dozens more At the fence with the entire beach now visible I count more than thirty of them and these just on the waterfront Just beyond the fence are a few pieces of ancient playground equipment scattered about the sand I try to imagine the happy cries of the children as their parents more than twenty five years before pushed them round an d round in dizzying circles on the miniature merrygoaround now rusted and partially buried by drifted sand There is a long slide too though halftumbled down one of its rusted supports having twisted and collapsed after so many years of weather and neglect My own memories of childhood end at no such place now trapped inside a militarized nomans land How different life must seem to those whose memories do What sorts of dreams are built on this type of innocence lost I turn around and walk to the Palm Beach Hotel along the way wondering if it was merely luck that had left it on the business side of the fence On its porch I chose a chair since it has become cold near a partly cracked door through which comes a warm draft I order a cup of tea As the evening grows darker so does the abandoned town spread out before me The crescent moon is now higher in the sky and together with a strategically placed star provides a tiny bright exclamation point over the entire disma l scene below At that moment two energetic young men burst through the door The bigger of the two is gripping the arm of the other directing him forward to the porchs railing Bak look he says in Turkish gesturing out toward the sea with a broad sweep of his free arm Harika degil mi Wonderful isnt it Evet cok guzel Yes very beautiful his friend agrees They stand gazing out over the sea though after a brief moment I see the smaller mans head turn toward the darkened hulks that line the shore The bigger man glances at his friend sees where he is looking then looks himself They are both silent for quite some time before the bigger man returns his attention to his friend squeezes his arm His friend as if awakening from a trance slowly pulls his gaze from the ruins smiles up at his companion After two identical simultaneous shrugs they chuckle uneasily shaking their heads as they do When they turn to return to the door I holler out to them Baris mumkun m u Is peace possible They stop look at me with frowns of curiosity Nerelisiniz Where are yo u from It is the big one who had taken the lead Amerikaliyim Im an American His frown deepens though now for a different reason Belki dort bes yil sonra Maybe four five years from now belki hic bir zaman yok maybe never Ama ne hakkinda otuz bir ocak bir yeni baris gurusmesi But what about January st the new peace negotiations Hah he exclaims interrupting me Her zamen yeni baris gorumesi var There are always new peace negotiations He thereupon dismisses my inference with the same sweeping arm gesture he used to introduce to his friend the sea Get Your Private Free Email at

<18898317.1075840081875.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-04-05 21:20:00,Cc This is the first day of the Kurban Bayram Holiday of the Sacrifice and Istanbuls streets are full of folks in their holiday best And blood For days cows lambs goats rams and other big animals have been being brought to Istanbul from the countryside I read that in Cairo you could see people bringing their animals in by cab Tent cites consisting of rickety structures of unlumbered wood and huge plastic tarps full of these doomed animals have sprung up under bridges in garbage filled lots and along the highways The citys normal perfume of car exhaust and coal fumes is now mixed with the heavy smells of the barnyard And today the slaughter began Pools of blood and rain spotted the pavement in front of my building evidence of a recent butchering On a muddy hillside in one of the older neighborhoods south of the Halic Golden Horn in Eski Old Istanbul I saw several women all smiling surrounding a man vigorously chopping away at the rib cage of a cow with an ax The cows recently skinned hide was spread out neatly beside them the rest of the animal in a heap nearby I passed three men loading sagging plastic sacks no doubt full of the spoils of a recent kill into the trunk of a car Sorry but my weak imagination couldnt help but conjure up to images from Scorceses Goodfellas By a mosque three was a lone Rams head under a tree Its snout was pointing upwards as if thinking about stretching a neck that was no longer there to the leaves just above it On the sidewalk in front of a butcher shop a man hacking off the skin of a decapitated lamb rolled the body back and forth like a water balloon A few meters away a pen full of sheep ate their feed contentedly from a trough I looked closely at them was surprised to see that they seemed oblivious to the significance of what was going on right next to them Mounds of entrails lay in the gutter of one street I walked bye the opening of a narrow alley from which I was assaulted by a draft bloated with the now unpleasant order of fresh meat Later I watched with absolutely no idea what it meant a young man put his fingers into the blood runoff of one butchering then walk to his car and wipe it on the license plate The Kurban Bayram is an extremely important holiday for Moslems second only Ramadon Ramazon in Turkish Its the time for the hajj hac in Turkish or pilgrimage to Mecca which all Moslems of any means are to make at least once in their lifetimes Here in Turkey most folks get at least two days off work some the entire week During the holiday throughout the Moslem world many families buy an entire animal for sacrifice using only a part of it themselves giving the bulk of it to others including most importantly the poor Some play amateur butcher but I have been told the vast majority of them have an expert do it Indeed the Koran demands that the sacrifice be as quick and painless as possible The holiday itself celebrates the Old Testament story in which Ibrahim Abraham to nonMoslems was ordered by God to sacrifice his son Abraham reluctantly agreed but was given a last minute reprieve and was allowed to sacrifice a ram instead It is a powerful story about belief and faith and must give animal rightists a few textual problems I can see why Moslems have picked the story out as paramount It certainly provides an interesting contrast to the New Testament story of Gods sacrifice of his son As I walked around Istanbul today I overwhelmed The city was a slaughterhouse full of for me somewhat gruesome contrasts Young girls in flowered dresses and boys in tiny threepiece suits ran around the streets laughing and playing games with blood on their shoes I passed a curious boy kicking at some unfortunate creatures stomach which had been left on a pile of garbage I saw a little girl holding her mothers hand smiling at me shyly as her mom picked through a pile of discarded intestines April My discontent at the sights of the Kurban I concluded later was a bit sanctimonious Americans eat considerable more meat than Turks its only that in the United States the dismemberment is done quite a bit more discretely But why should it be Isnt it a better or at least a lot more honest to understand what the animal part and animal youre eating looked like when it was still alive including rippling muscles forlorn gaze and all I thought of my canoe trips to Canada and how much more meaningful my fish dinner was because I had caught and cleaned the unlucky critter myself A sharpening of reality I think is always a good thing especially in this time when so much of our knowledge and experience comes secondhand through the media including I have to reluctantly admit my beloved books If our rituals often the most powerful means of creating realityblindness can be infused with as much truth as possible all the better Id say Then perhaps when those flimsy dreams we try to kid ourselves with disintegrate like pieces of wet toilet paper Today is the fivemonth anniversary of my arrival here in Istanbul Its an amazing thing Ive done for myself I think I am as close to totally engaged in my life and the world around me as I have ever been It will be hard to live any other way again I imagine In the last week and a half three terrorists here in Turkey succeeded only in blowing themselves up much I suppose to their martyred souls chagrin Ive got to hope that these crazy acts are evidence of the PKK or whomever being on its last legs There are important elections national and local coming up on April th so well probably get a chance to see just how long those legs are Hope all is well Drop me a line MarkO Get Your Private Free Email at

trust that we have chosen right WH Auden The view from my living room a southern view begins with a mess of red tiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic Golden Horn On the other side of the Halic a riverharbor once beautiful and fast flowing now stalled and polluted are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium later to be called Constantinople later still Istanbul was founded nearly six centuries before the birth of Christ Above a cement colored smear of apartment buildings of much more recent vintage I can make out the outlines of towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the s AD I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques built in the s during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman Suleyman the Magnificent Otherwise the hillsides of Eski Old Istanbul are covered by the before mentioned apartment buildings relatively new but already appearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement They are I suppose full of people who for the most part work far too much for far too little and who must wonder more and more with each passing day about the relevance of their muezzins cries Incongruously hundreds maybe thousands of sea gulls screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters dip and rise in the air space between me and all of that I recently bought a cheap guitar I left a better one back in the States from my friend Ilyas and from time to time I sit looking out my window while playing sad songs from Americas south the easiest kind to play slow with three chords and as Bono pretentiously said the truth This evening I did just that singing and playing among others a song by Steve Earle in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long ago love Was I off somewhere or maybe just too high and one by Lucinda Williams who sings about hitting the road in order to forget When I get to Baton Rouge I wont cry a tear for you A pile of clouds staacked up on the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset but the invisible sun still makes its presence know bordering them crimson I watch the neddlelike vapor trail of a jet crawl west until it too disappears behind the clouds all the time wondering about when I too will be heading in that same direction What will it be like to be in America again I dont think Ive ever developed particularly deep psychic connections with places though that is not to say I havent loved the places Ive lived I truly adore San Francisco and I always come to Dallass defense I appreciate Aurora Illinois and miss Westfield New Jersey often wondering what it would have been like to have finished my growing up there But because perhaps I ultimately value experience more than comfort and dont get me wrong I value comfort a great deal maybe I havent been able to convince myself at some critical fundamental level to believe that settling down in one place or come to think of it with one person for the rest of my life is an ultimate goal Of course I worry about where this all might lead with the specter of absolute and perhaps God forbid unbearable loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility But then again maybe Im just looking for the ultimate home and will burrow in deeply once Ive found it My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home after what was for me at least a wonderful tenday visit They werent so sure about the Boza a sweet slightly fermented drink made from millet I accosted them with at a tiny caf in the center of Eski Istanbul but they tried it anyway Later forgetting about how scared I had been the first time I was there I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on a postdusk walk through the working class Kucuk Pazar neighborhood on our way to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the Suleymaniye Mosque While passing through Kucuk Pazar we turned into one particularly poorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in near total darkness I could only tell they were smoking by the occasional flare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes After first not knowing what in the world wed stumbled onto I realized we were passing near a hamam Turkish public bath no doubt an immensely important institution in Kucuk Pazar as many of the apartments there I have been told have no showers Notwithstanding these and a few other nonstarters I still think Misha and Ninas trip was a success We did and saw a lot albiet while suffering through the hot humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer Probably of most significance to me was checking in with Misha after nearly nine months apart We had much to talk about or at least to allude to vaguely During one of our more memorable ie ridiculous jaunts into these wordy nevernever lands which occurred on the roof porch of my building and lasted until four in the morning Misha was patient and courteous when I suggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood space between an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understand department In response I referred to some of the books Ive read This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons though I plan on studying Turkish a lot for example translating newspaper articles and writing and with the help of Ismail and Sukran trying to absorb more deeply all that I have learned to date And I have learned a lot including an incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary Still I wonder if this old dog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where to lay down afterwards My biggest problem among many I know is hearing Turkish My two most used sentences are Ne dediniz What did you say and Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz Can you say that again I will be buying a television ugh as Ive concluded that a television is an important way to learn how to hear Turkish Most importantly this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writing program writing for a least three hours a day five days a week Insallah With gods help That coupled with work and Turkish and my reading should keep me pretty busy and hopefully productive At least I should

Thanks again for the communication Like I said in earlier note things seem pretty normal Stores without electricty but open No one seems to be hoarding Indeed except for lack of electricity I really wouldnt know anything happened and I walked around for a couple hours covering some ground It was strange but I had great trouble getting to sleep last night and probably only did so minutes before the quake Next couple hours was spont outdoors with the rest of my neighbors Took a pretty good walk then too and again saw little damage though admittedly it was the middle of the night The one good thing is that for the first time in my stay here the stars were all out as the city had gone dark Quite an experience More later Mark From To Mark Skilling Subject UPDATE before heading home for the night am CDT TUES Date Tue Aug Dear Mark Just finished the late news its past midnight herebut wanted to check in one last time and will monitor the internet here at work for future communications from you as they become possible Mom and Dad are on following this online as well I called them the minute the bulletins started coming across on the earthquake and Mom saw it on television shortly afterward We had CNN video of some of the victims on our midnight news tonight so were just starting to see what has happened there AP is now saying at least are dead and reporting that at least buildings in Istanbul have crumbled I guess Izmit miles east of you in Instabulyoull know where these cities are has been hardest hit with of the deaths there And an oil refinery is said to be on fire in the city of Bursa where six are reported dead If this story is like so many others at this point were only starting to get the picture It sounds like a messand the aftershocks are always said to be frightening Were all very concerned about you after this Markbut I cant begin to tell you how relieved we were to hear from you I hope youre really all right We know communications are apt to be sporadic in coming days but well await word on how youre doingI couldnt get over the fact you were able to get through to us so quickly I know battery power for your laptop is at a premium and that youll be carefully using your PCproviding the phone lines hold uptheyre saying there are a lot of lines down I didnt realize Istabul was so biga city of million learned that on the wires but have no idea how sophisticated or well equipped the Turkish rescue teams are nor how extensive the damage has beenwill food become short when will electricity be restored etc Were concerned about you Mark

<12116.1075840082208.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-08-20 01:36:00,August The afternoon ezan is as if a lament The muezzins voice seems fuller more emotional and he sings strong and slow Because the electricity in my neighborhood had been off most of the day apparently as a precaution against fire it was the first amplified call to prayer I have heard today But it is not for us he wails My neighborhood has been relatively untouched some fallen masonry an empty top floor apartment overlooking the square surrounding the Galata Tower half collapsed debris from it partially blocking the road that circles the square Thousands are suspected dead in an incredible series of earthquakes the first a possible and unfathomable on the Richter scale that began this morning at Images on the TV are horrific a five story building off its foundation leaning against the building next to it a warehouse its roof collapsed on fire the top half of a minaret toppled a bridge severed neatly into four parts collapsed Worse yet dozens of apartment buildings flattened into cruel piles of concrete beams and slabs twisted steel reinforcement and rubble A handsome father breaks down in the arms of friends in front of one such monstrosity At another a reporter shoves her microphone into a hole under a concrete beam interviews someone trapped there the camera then panning back to show an impossible heap of debris above I had trouble getting to sleep last night which was unusual Ismail and I had spent a fine evening at one of our favorite outdoor cafs under trees whose leaves were gently tussled by a breeze coming down the Bosphorus Nearby was the impressive bulk of the Nusretiye Mosque built by Sultan Mahmut the Second some years ago to celebrate his victory over the corrupt Janissary a kind of special guard to the Sultan We spoke of writing of nationalism about my upcoming trip to the States about learning a new language about a possible trip together in the winter along the coast of the Aegean Sea We were both particularly buoyant with the worst of the summer heat and humidity seemingly behind us In retrospect it was as if we were summing some things up a minor period in our lives over a new one soon to begin I returned home around midnight lay in my bed mulling absurdly over possible problems that might arise on trips that are many weeks away The last time I looked at my watch it was well after am It seemed that something woke me up other than the shaking though Im not sure It may have been dogs barking a person yelling or the birds Perhaps it was simply the first gentle movements of the quake triggering deeply imbedded memories and fears from the quake I experienced in San Francisco I was up out of my bed though still half a sleep before it got really bad There was a crazy mess of sounds from wood and metal and whatever squeaking and creaking around me The movement and sounds confused me at first and I remember thinking for a moment or two that there were other people in my place and that this was the problem Soon however there was no question what was happening By then I was in my hallway where three doorways were close together The first moments of a serious earthquake when you are up in a building are as if the earth below is swelling the building riding those swells like waves Then it gets awful out of control and it is nothing at all like the comfort of riding waves I felt the sickening feeling of my building being all too easily whipped around from side to side and otherwise Though it was dark the ceilings walls and floors all seemed at absurd new angles visavis each other The shaking was bad enough I could imagine that things might start collapsing From time to time I darted out of the relatively safety of the hallway to grab my sweats a jacket my bag Soon the shaking stopped I heard it lasted some seconds and then I really started racing to get outside I must have been soaked with adrenaline by this point remembering to grab my Turkish dictionary a flashlight which unfortunately wasnt assembled I did that later and I had to root around the drawer for the batteries some extra cash even my camera The electricity stayed on for a bit which was helpful but was off by the time I opened my door a minute or two later My place is five stories up on the top floor and theres a veranda off to one side Perhaps unwisely though I couldnt resist I went out on it for a quick look out over the city It was dark except for a moving light here and there the headlights of cars Something may have been burning across the Golden Horn in the Balat neighborhood I could see the silhouettes of a few of the great Mosques against a sky now full of beautiful stars Below a car alarm had gone off and people were yelling and shouting I worked my way carefully down the stairs concerned that they may have collapsed I spent most of the next two or three hours with the crowd that had gathered in the relative safety of the square around the Galata Tower though I occasionally shot a worried look up at that huge mass looming above us At one point I took a long walk further up my hill then along Istiklal Caddesi my part of the citys main street Other than the electricity being out and the people on the streets there was little physical evidence of the earthquake Some masonry had fallen As I mentioned above an abandoned apartment was half collapsed near my place I saw no one hurt But I did saw people in their underwear a women mumbling about Mohammed in one hand a water bottle the other with its palm turned up to the sky which as I said was starry Some people were laughing others were crying most were huddled together in small groups talking quietly Many of the women were wearing headscarves more than usual it seemed An outdoor caf next to the tower opened and served tea and water I knew a few people there and with my poor Turkish learned that in was really bad in Izmit sixty of so miles east of here that even here in Istanbul a few buildings may have collapsed Dawn came and I returned to my apartment slept for a few hours That sleep was interrupted and made fitful by what I learned later were a series of fairly significant aftershocks On the television a crowd just burst into applause A young boy has been rescued from one collapsed building Except for being dusty he appears unscathed As they carry him to an ambulance a reporter follows asking him questions Were you scared Cok kokum very scared He seems pleased to be back in the world by the attention hes getting Then he is asked about his family His eyes grow wide his face long Annem my mother kardesim my sisterbrother sesleri duydum I heard their voices Duydum By the time they reach the ambulance he is screaming

lot of good questions The best indication my building is ok is that its standing and that its contemporaires are all standing as well You may have read that the buildings that fell for the most part are of new vintage and are in the lowlands Mine is neither Spoke to my landlord today who is an engineer of some sort and for what its worth he said the building is a good one About shots I got all ones recommended by my doctor before I left SF though he wasnt planning for one of the worst natural disasters in our time Im keeping my eye out about the how and why of the spread of the diseases theyre worried about here but am pretty sure that one cirterion is that you have to be pretty darn close which Im not Im not our sticking my nose into anything though would love to see things up close for curiositys sake Trouble is Id just be getting in the way which I dont want to do So will for now restrict myself to giving a little cash and observing what goes on here on the home front The damage really is not apparent from here As I mentioned in my note to dad things are pretty darn normal Expect indirect impact to be visable like worsening inflation for example But thats about it Will keep an eye out for trouble though More later Thanks again for taking the time to write Its always nice to hear from you Love Mark From To Mark Skilling Subject Thanks for the wonderful updates and stay safe and healthy Date Sat Aug Mark Thank YOU for your notes Had we not heard from you our lives here would have proceeded in terror We wouldnt know where to begin trying to find you and the troubles there seem so far flung and numerous that Im sure no on in authority could have taken the time to help They have their hands full The fact that your building held up and that were not looking on helplessly like the poor devils we see on television must do knowing loved ones are dying or dead beneath mounds of shattered concrete underscores Moms lucky star notiona comment we made to each other as we talked earlier today I am relieved to hear you are able to obtain food Theyre saying disease is spreading in the wake of thisespecially with the heat thats underway Please Mark be careful Your accounts of events there are extraordinary but Id rather have you safe and well then threatened by illness or harm at the hands of these aftershocks were hearing about The wire services are reporting the official death toll at but add that are missing beneath the rubble many presumed dead Concern about the spread of disease is being raised not only because of decaying corpses under building but because of the number of people forced to sleep outdoors without toilets or proper sanitation The water is a source of concern Its appearing this may rival the s quake there said to have killed I dont know much about the spread of disease or the way you protect yourself against its spread I presume you were innoculated before going over Mark If not can you get shots anywhere now Your accounts are extraordinary and you give us insight into the environment which preceded and followed this debacle Please be careful Mark Id rather have you healthygiven a choice between that and news of whats happening there Are you satisfied your building is safe to return to Will food become a problem as this situation continues Also what happens when the weather starts turning colderwhere are all the homeless going to live It doesnt sound like the authorities there can get a handle on something this widespread and devastatingat least not anytime in the near future at least Thanks for all the news Markand please be careful and take care of yourself Im not sure exactly what we can do for you from this distance but I did see Jeffs email offering to help through Enron shipments Will close

Author Mark Skilling at InternetTCO Date AM Tom Thanks again fro your thoughtful notes Cant say life normal but in areas without damage not to far away from it Plenty of food No hoarding Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normal loads on a daily basis just like before Of course things will be taxed by the demands of the rescue and restoration but looks like the suffering will be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones And what a lot of suffering that will be Do have access to my building It is on solid ground and is older which in Turkey ironically means safer Still spent two of the last three nights sleeping outside with millions of others Again my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me Sukran too and have been able to enjoy his and his friends company On these nights every open space not too close to a building seems to be filled with people sleeping on blankets jackets etc Some have strung string between things trees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets made relatively cozy little spots for themselves It continues to amaze me how kind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here though I did hear of one poor old fellow got his shoes stolen perhaps he simply absent mindely misplaced them Everyone though is tramatized tired and sad And what you read about impact on attempts to get economy which has been hit hard by Russian crisis going unfortuantely appear right on the mark Wish Turkey all the luck in the world It will need it Able to watch the local news though obviously dont understand a lot of what theyre saying Still the pictures tell enough More later Nice to know youre thinking about me Let dad and mom know not taking any chances that werent there already Love Mark From To Subject Concern about you from back homeTHURSDAY evening PM cdt Date Thu Aug Dear Mark We continue to follow your emails and the news reports on the earthquke disaster there Wanted to drop you a note before heading home for the night Im concerned about your well being and wondering if youve daredor have been allowedback in your apartment News reports here indicate many are sleeping outsideand being encouraged to do so by the goverment there who fears buildings have been weakened and may succomb to powerful afterschocks Reportedly the Kandilli Observatory there reported aftershocks in just hours today Thursday Reports were getting here put the death toll at with injured The UN says are still buried and feared dead and its experts are saying most who are saved after a disaster like this are saved in the first hoursits been at least hours as I write this to you They say the smell of decomposing bodies is flooding some sections of the countrys hardest hit cities and that there is fear of spreading disease I see the US has ordered Marines and Navy sailors in and told them to step up rescue efforts Were also told something like countriesincluding Israel Germany France Britain and Japan are dispatching rescue teams and equipment The news wires and television reports are covering other US rescuers who are heading over but fear its too late It sounds from your emails like your neighborhood escaped the worst of the damage But I wonder how safe you feel your building is after the shake it endured Also wonder whether you can get adequet food and water and whether phone and electrical service is regular and reliable I cant tell you how relieved we were to receive the quick communication minutes the other night Wed have been worried sick about your wellbeing Clearly news reports center on the hardest hit areasso its hard to picture how normal your life is in the wake of the quake There is real concern being expressed on our news here about how the masses left homeless by this disaster are going to be housed in the coming cold seasonwhich isnt all that far away I also saw a notation on one of the wire stories that recent economic movestermed fairly severe in news reportsby the government there to get inflation under control made this an especially inoportune time for this disaster to hit Hope youre doing all right Mark and I join Dad in urging care I guess they had a point something quake north of SFO just the other evening and the disaster there has the earthquake concerns in vulnerable parts of this country very much in the news The Turkey quake has led national news here since it happened and a new cable system installed in my building lets me see all the CNN servicesincluding CNN Internationalso I think Im seeing what you can see of CNN there Please be careful and keep us posted on how youre doing We really appreciate all of your emails to date I love you Mark Tom Get Your Private Free Email at Get Your Private Free Email at 
<14085672.1075840082402.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-08-25 20:35:00,Re ITS FABULOUS Cc From previous notes which I bccd to you looks like Im in business Ive really appreciated your two recent emails as I have all of them Had gone to the Tribune web site something Id done before in order to show my friends here your picture and brag a bit looking for info on percepctive section but probably due to my bad searches didnt unearth it You explanation was very important Also important were your comments on what struck you about what Ive been writing Those kind of comments are the best kind Often when writing its hard to know what works and what doesnt work Perhaps the most important thing however is that the article will be published by Tom Skillings brother Though nothings been published yet and I shouldnt write as if thats a certainty afraid of bad luck would never had gotten close to this opportunity without you Im very grateful Love you and looking forward to both of us experiencing how this ol newspaper media machine works something with which I guess you are all to familiar MarkO From To Mark Skilling Subject ITS FABULOUS Date Wed Aug Mark My read on this is that its terrific You personalize this tragedy in a way only one familiar with the area and its people can You take me through the whole experience in a way Ive not visited the subject before Im not an editorbut it strikes me that this is just the sort of insight into a calamatous event of our day that the Tribune seeks in its Perspective section Editing is always a devil and I suspect you are a lot better at it than I amknowing the subject as completely as you do You probably are right that introducing the reader right up front to the notion this is about the unimaginable tragedy about which weve been hearing for days now is a good idea But my sense is that youve infused this piece with an on the ground and there feel which can only come from one uniquely familiar with this devastated city and region Youre definitely on the right track Mark Congratulations It will be interesting to how the Perspective people feel I think theyre going to be pleased What a job Thanks for sharing this with me Mark Look forward to hearing how this proceeds As Ive said before youre introducing me to a place and events with which I have no personal familiarity After reading your work I feel a kinship with the people and place and the misery thats been imposed on them and it by nature Fascinating Love you Mark This is no easy assignmentyet youve done a beautiful job in trying circumstances Again congratulations Tom Reply Separator Subject no subject Author Mark Skilling at InternetTCO Date AM Dear Bill Hope all is well The piece which is cut and pasted in below is a too long now at some words The first paragraph could go I suppose though I think it gets in some historical information that has not been in anything else Ive been reading Also I think it is important that Turkey has for many years been caught in a tremendous struggle accommodating its rich cultural heritage with the demands of the present Its fair to say that this struggle is one of the main reasons I first became interested in Turkey The present suffered a huge setback with the quake in that not only did the modern secular government fail terribly but so did the modern buildings That the repairs to the old city wall crumbled but the not ancient wall itself seems an apt symbol of this Maybe the stuff on San Francisco can go though I guess it is interesting that I lived through both experiences Also the paragraph about prequake hospitality is not really necessary Perhaps a more general pruning job rather than the crude removal of entire paragraphs would do the job Then again you will probably have all together different ideas I look forward to working with you all on this Mark From my living room I look down a hill over a collection of red tiled rooftops to the Golden Horn This river once beautiful and fast flowing is now stalled and polluted On the other side of the Golden Horn are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium later to be called Constantinople later still Istanbul was founded some thousand years ago Above a cement colored smear of apartment buildings of much more recent vintage I can make out the outlines of towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the sixth century nearly thousand years ago They are now rotten with age though parts had recently been rebuilt for tourists Some of these restored parts collapsed during last Tuesdays earthquake The ancient parts were left untouched Less than a block away is the minaret of our small neighborhood mosque From here you can hear five times a day its ezan or call to prayer That call is now as if a lament The muezzins voice seems fuller more emotional than usual He sings in Arabic which I dont understand but Ive read that his call reminds the believers that God is most great and tells them to Come to prayer come to prosperity I listen carefully for signs of doubt about Gods mercy and compassion But I detect no doubt at all Instead it is simply beautiful and sad and despite not understanding what he sings very moving In the past few days I have heard many sad tired people say automatically and surprisingly without bitterness that Allah verir Allah alir God gives God takes away And much has been taken away The death toll from last Tuesdays earthquake is likely to exceed with an equal number injured Up to have been left homeless Millions more in the days immediately following the quake chose to sleep outdoors including me afraid of the aftershocks All over Istanbul in the parks and squares even on narrow medians between busy streets entire families spent the days and nights on blankets spread out on the ground In the grassy Hippodrome along side the spectacular Blue Mosque and in the gardens between that same mosque and the Sancta Sophia where you would normally expect hundreds of tourists to be milling about it was as if a great migration was taking place Many of the women wore brightly colored headscarves Other women despite the heat were dressed from head to toe in more somber black Some families brought portable propane burners to make the their beloved tea Many more had lugged along pillows and mattresses others string and rope which they strung between trees and posts and hung sheets for a bit of privacy On the nights immediately after the quake I was grateful to receive an invitation to join my friend Ismails family and the family of a friend of his to spend the night in a little park in the hills above the Bosphorus Bridge The Bosphorus Bridge is a huge modern suspension bridge connecting Europe and Asia that looks like a gray version of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco With the bridges hulk looming seemingly helplessly below us I shared a corner of a colorful Turkish blanket covering the ground We drank tea smoked cigarettes and joked about being gocebe nomads and about the Turks finally returning to their forgotten nomadic roots I practiced my Turkish with the children who unlike most older Turks were able to correct me in English During the night while I slept someone put a jacket over me Now that the rains and cooler weather have come and the experts have given an allclear sign most of us have returned to our homes Back in my apartment I glance at my walls at my ceilings find it impossible not to think of all those still buried underneath theirs Last night at our favorite tea garden I joined Ismail and his wife Dilek who had just learned that three of her cousins had died in Adapazari We talked about whether people here will ever be able to forget return to something of a normal life It hadnt started raining yet so we stayed late admitted to being a bit nervous about returning home The government and the army are being severely criticized in the local press and on the streets as are the construction contractors There have been other problems as well In an open area near the caf I mentioned above where dozens of families had come to spend the night an old man had his shoes stolen I was told the story of a Turk in Yalova one of the hardest hit areas selling bottled water for million TL dollars ten times the normal price That profiteer however was apparently beaten subsequently by the storyteller himself while a nearby policeman did nothing to intervene Yet notwithstanding the widespread and no doubt legitimate anger at the official response that of ordinary Turks has been overwhelming and impressive A large truck from my relatively poor working class neighborhood was quickly filled with needed supplies water bread medicine and sent to one disaster site The company of one of my students sent along a similar truckload of supplies and has now set up a fund to collect money for the homeless The same is true of business group to which the company of a dear friend of mine Sukran belongs Efforts like these have been going on everywhere In addition thousands of people from all over Turkey have gone to the stricken areas to help including Kurds who want to prove their commitment to the Turkish State I recall the criticism I heard after the San Francisco World Series Earthquake which I unfortunately experienced as well Though admittedly a much less serious affair the cries about lax enforcement of building codes were similar Everyone promised to do better and I hope they have I recall my own pathetic plans never implemented to prepare for the next big one I had cut an article out of the paper which listed the emergency supplies that should be kept close on hand Though I kept that list near to the top of my pile of important papers over the years it simply grew yellow and torn I finally threw it away at the time I packed up for my move to Istanbul Significantly before I left San Francisco last fall damage from that quake was still being repaired some ten years later and complaints could still be heard about the governments continuing failure to enforce building codes rigorously enough My experience since coming to Istanbul has been one of almost unending Turkish hospitality I could have been left alone but was not When I first came here on vacation some two years ago I meet a fine man Ilyas who makes Saz a stringed musical instrument that is as important here as the guitar is in America and bought a beautiful one from him When I returned to Istanbul this time to live I visited Ilyas again to say hello and talk about possible Saz lessons When he learned I was looking for an apartment he took most of the next day off and showed me around his neighborhood eventually helping me to find the place I now live The lessons he eventually gave me were free My friend Ismail has spent countless hours with me roaming the city looking for deals on used furniture He and his wife have also lent me a beautiful rug a blanket and several other very useful items in my apartment I occasionally get gifts from my students and never an unkind word from anyone After the earthquake itself several of my Turkish friends kept in constant touch with me Several days ago on the television I saw and heard a crowd burst into applause A young boy had just been rescued from one of the many collapsed buildings Except for being dusty he appeared unscathed As they carried him to an ambulance a reporter followed asking him questions Were you scared Cok korktum very scared He response was perky He was clearly delighted to be back in the world by the attention he was getting Then he was asked about his family His eyes grew wide his face long Annem my mother kardesim my sisterbrother sesleri duydum I heard their voices Duydum By the time they reached the ambulance he was screaming Sesleri duydum Sesleri duydum I hope the rest of the world hears Turkeys cries for help Insallah daha iyi olacak With Gods help things will be better Insallah Turkiye iyi sanslar From all of us good luck August Istanbul Turkey Get Your Private Free Email at Get Your Private Free Email at

strange to think that right now as I write this you are on the set at WGN in the middle of the news program perhaps putting a few finishing touches on your graphics Just as I got up a few minutes ago I got up early which is the best time to get through to the line I share and also because Im excited and at the exact time I turned on the computor there was a flash of lightening outside Then moments later just as a healthy downpour began the muezzin started singing outside This is true no lie I thought to myself I hope there arent any more cosmic coincidences such as a well you know Ill be on line for a bit so maybe well be able to talk on this thing almost as if in person Love Mark From To Mark Skilling Subject Editing etc Date Thu Aug Hi Mark Below is an edited version of your piece Weve got a few questions which Ive indicated parenthetically through the story Most of the editing is designed to tighten things a little And weve reorganized some sentences to clarify meaning This is an interesting moment in the writereditor relationship and I regret that were experiencing it in cyberspace Its hard to show you each change and explain it but hopefully theyll be more or less selfexplanatory if you compare the edited version with a printout of the original story In any case be of good cheer this is not an extraordinary amount of editing Id suggest that you answer our questions and raise any points about editing within the story just as we have done and then email the whole story back Ill try again to call you Friday Youll see some strange characters in the text theyre our computer coding You can safely ignore them I did get through on the fax line and sent you both a contract and a tax form I hope you got them Hayirli isler Bill By Mark Skilling ISTANBULFrom

<31768270.1075840082830.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-12-28 01:55:00,Cc Ive cut and pasted in below a piece that should be published in the Turkish Daily News the English language paper here later this week Its a first person piece about my experience of a Christmas service here last year a lot of which youll recognize from last year Ugh Im already repeating myself and Ive just started though really had no choice as needed to get it out before the holiday itself Since this year Christmas again fell during the Muslim Holy Month of Ramadan the piece is sort of year neutral Happy holidays MarkO Christmas Day Istanbul The priest mutters his deeply accented English into the microphone which amplifies and further distorts his voice His bluntly pronounced words rebound through the vast freezing hall of Saint Antoine Cathedral They tell a story familiar to me about the Son of God being sent to earth to die for our sins But here in the middle of this enormous Muslim City the story sounds strange and almost subversive And indeed the Christ story is at the center of the great Christian and Muslim divide Muslims accept only that Christ was a prophet sent by God rejecting vehemently that Christ is his son They see Mohammeds prophecy and the Koran as prompted by the need to correct the mistaken elevation by the Gospel of Christ from the flesh to the divine The priest appears relieved to turn things over to an African man who in a bizarre contrast to the priests gold embroidered robe is wearing a big stuffed yellow ski jacket His English is much better as he announces that we are now to sing a hymn The songs words handwritten and in English are flashed up onto a screen by an overhead projector The lyrics are basic There are several identical stanzas that simply invite Jesus to come I grimace slightly when I see that these are followed by a poorly translated chorus which asks for the Son of God to come will be born in our heart I glance over at Ismail a Muslim friend who has come with me to the service He smiles gives me a wink His English is excellent and I am sure he notices the mistake I look around at the rest of the people in the sanctuary The pews are not even a third full This is the first service of the day and is completely in English It will be followed by an Italian and a Turkish one The crowd at the Turkish service Ismail tells me will overflow into the courtyard in front of the Cathedral and will consist mostly of Muslims curious to see a Christmas service Apparently some members of St Antoines permanent congregation are angry about this since many of them will be unable to find a place to sit Some may even being forced to stand out in the cold Christmas Day this year falls within the Muslim holy Month of Ramadan during which the faithful are to fast between sunrise and sunset or more precisely according to the Koran between the times one can discern a white thread from a black one Ramadan is celebrated during the ninth month of the Muslim calendar which is a lunar one in the solar calendar it occurs days earlier each year My day had started well before dawn when I was awoken by our neighborhoods Ramadan drummer who was roaming the streets pounding his drum and hollering at the top of his lungs Since Ramadan began several days ago all over Istanbul similar drummers have been setting out into the streets some as early as am A tradition originating from a time when clocks were less prevalent their aim is to rustle the believers up out of bed in time for them to have a meal before the sun comes up Ramadan is by far the most important religious observance of the year for Muslims Somewhat like the Jewish celebration of Yom Kippur which some say influenced it Ramadan is a period of atonement and forgiveness Total remission of sins can be achieved if one fasts with pure intentions I have been told that in Turkey which is Muslim well over of all the Turks fast during Ramadan That estimate is certainly consistent with what I have seen and heard The majority of the Turks I come in contact tell me they fast The streets of Istanbul are normally full of vendors selling all sorts of food There are noticeably fewer of them now and they are significantly less busy During the day some restaurants are closed many of the rest all but empty I myself have been careful to be respectful and eat only indoors avoiding among other things my usual practice of grabbing a simit a bagel like round of bread and piece of fruit in the morning and eating them on my way to work Ismail leans over and asks if the service is similar to ones in the States I whisper back that I was raised Protestant and had not seen enough Catholic services in my life to say Raised Protestant was really much too strong a word to use My early religious education involved little more than an hour each Sunday down in the basement of the local Presbyterian Church first in Westfield New Jersey later in Aurora Illinois with my twin sister Sue There during our Sunday school class we often struggle for the entire hour to suppress giggling fits to which we only seemed susceptible in church Sitting now in St Antoines I check myself to see if any of those fits still linger am relieved to discover that none do The priest has returned and is now saying something about light being shown into the darkness and about how the darkness was unable to defeat that light The image of a light tiny but robust surrounded by infinite darkness is a particularly powerful one for me today especially given that I am so far from what I am most familiar A new voice the priest had been replaced again asks us to rise The words of Come Let Us Adore Him are projected onto the screen I lean over toward Ismail whisper that this is a very famous song He kids under his breath that perhaps its one of Gods greatest hits I smile straighten back up listen to the song begin There is no choir only a single guitar for accompaniment It takes a while for the congregations singing to build up Though it never becomes particularly loud it is beautiful Eventually I join in too As if something ethereal our voices drift up through the tremendous space that envelops us seeming only to just barely penetrate the thick cold air I am moved by how wonderful our singing sounds and am surprised to feel a tear though already icecold in the corner of my eye Most of the people here are Westerners I suppose and I wonder how many came like me to be reminded of home a few cold foreigners dwarfed by a Cathedral that is itself dwarfed by the immense Moslem city surrounding it For the first time since arriving in Istanbul I feel a bit homesick The song ends The priest returns invites everyone up to take communion Thinking that Ismail might find it interesting I suggest that we walk to the front of the church to watch We do But when we get there I am surprised that our way is blocked by a dozen or so television cameramen who have begun filming the ceremony I had not seen them before and wonder where they might have been hiding Some now with the powerful lights attached to their cameras turned on swing around and start filming those who have remained in the pews An older woman who is kneeling and praying is caught in one of those lights The cameraman moves in closer and is soon no more than a couple feet away With her eyes closed the elderly woman continues her praying I wonder how she can concentrate and indeed if she can But she continues or at least pretends to perhaps seeing it as an act of defiance The cameramen get even bolder and are now moving freely about the church filming others at point blank range Ismail says he does not want to be on the evening news and tells me he will meet me outside I return to my seat and watch the end of communion wrapped up like it is so incongruously in the hectic filming And I wonder how God would view all this his two most successful religions bumping up against each other in such an awkward fashion Which of the many ways these two religions have come up with to worship him would he approve of disapprove This afternoon in Istanbul the few Christians families that live here will be feasting and celebrating with their families and friends perhaps exchanging gifts Early in the evening after the blast of the cannon shots heard all over Istanbul that signal the end of the days Ramadan fasting pious Muslims will sit down to their own postfast celebratory meal the Iftar Later still the mosques will be filled though mostly by men where special Ramadan prayers will be said Istanbul itself is remarkable at least to westerners for the many domes of its huge Ottoman mosques and the hundreds of minarets that spike its skyline as well as the calls to prayer that pierce its urban din five times each day Yet when the day ends throughout Istanbul each of us will fall asleep under the same black sky In him was life and the life was the light of men And the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not Translation from the Bible Praise be to God Lord of the worlds The compassionate the merciful King on the day of reckoning Thee only do we worship and to Thee do we cry for help Guide Thou us on the straight path The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious with whom Thou are not angry and who go not astray

<10199109.1075840081714.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-02-27 22:30:00,Cc The below was originally the false start of a short story but quickly metamorphisized into something close to autobiography Some of the original atmospherics have lingered and dont necessarily reflect anything about yours truly Later At The Galata Tower Cafe Cigarette smoke ignoring the lazy sweep of an old ceiling fan hangs in the air above me It seems to mock my obsessive rambling thoughts about teaching and writing and learning Turkish and of course HER Take it easy it says with a smirk Relax A phony look of concern clouds it further What about taking a deep breath Surreptitiously I think I take in the recommended breath but the smoke has drifted in closer notices There Isnt that better No I say to myself Dont worry I am not so far gone as to take this internal dialogue thing outside I flick my hand through one particularly annoying cloud of the stuff Now get lost Outside at the base of the ancient Galata Tower kids on their way home from school set off an M I flinch at the explosion which is amplified by the tight dimensions of the square and the old stone walls surrounding it The square itself left in a premature dusk by the huge towers shadow is temporarily emptied of the teenaged mob I stare out the window into the gloom Though only the bottom few meters yards of the tower are visible to me I am aware of its tremendous bulk The tower first built by the Genoese in the s dominates my entire neighborhood the Kuledibi It should remind us all I suppose of the durability of stone and dirt and of the significantly less impressive characteristics of flesh and blood Day and night amused perhaps by the slim activity of this generations version of flesh and blood it stands obdurate unmoved like the leg of a giant one dare not disturb Emboldened by the lack of any official response to the bombing onebyone the would be terrorists or freedom fighters whos to say drift back into the square I suspect the tower isnt nearly half as bothered by these kids budding pyromania as me since it has no doubt been subject to much more serious attacks during its or so year history Seeing that no adult has stormed into the square to reestablish order I brace myself for another blast Maybe Im the only one who really minds Every male in this country does have to serve in the army for eighteen months Perhaps the noise doesnt bother them or maybe they see that this rather serious version of childs play has a practical side to it giving the kids a head start on basic training I am surprised to discover that the waiter Yusuf is standing next to me He has his head thrown back slightly a gesture that has become for my benefit his version of the question More tea He has given up on words as the ones he knows still dont much match the ones I know Evet cay lutfen Bir az sutlu lutfen Yes tea please With a little milk please Never would have guessed that huh And yes I agree and have been told before too many lutfens There are probably other mistakes too but my words seem to get the job done Ill work on perfecting them sonra later Yusuf nods walks away I realize I have my head bent forward a subconscious adjustment I must have made to dodge some of the smoke I see a cat under one of the tables looking up at me It opens its mouth for what I figure is the beginning of a yawn But instead it emits a strange highpitched wail sounding more like a bird than a cat Embarrassed for the poor thing I look away For maybe the first time since I have been coming to this cafe I take a close look around I must be getting more comfortable Dikkat Watch out There are very few other people in the cafe which is surprising given the amount of smoke They are all sitting alone their heads like mine bent forward I suspect that boredom however and not the smoke is the proximate cause Every table is covered with green felt table clothes all of which are seriously spotted with tea stains and cigarette burns In the middle of each table looking like a tiny shrunken crown is a silver ashtray Above the kitchen which is squeezed unnecessarily tight into a corner of the otherwise spacious caf hangs a huge painting of a beach scene from somewhere in the Pacific Once no doubt bright and evocative it has aged and has now almost completely blended into and disappeared amongst the dull wood panels covering the top half of the room The green of the palm trees lining the beach is now so dark it is approaching black The sand probably once pure white is the color of the mud in the streets outside and the sea close to the color of the tea served here There are several boats pictured all pulled up onto the sand but they are now no more than ghosts and indeed look as if someone may have tried to erase them The painting is as changed and distorted as the dreams of those who sit below it absentmindedly stirring their tea their feet crammed into shoes stiff from having walked through too much winter rain their fingernails having long ago surrendered to the dirt now permanently built up under them wearing clothes that didnt smell so bad this morning they couldnt be worn just one more day drinking the cheap tea they can scarcely afford dreaming perhaps of little more than an early spring I sit up in my chair let my head fall back take in a deep breath and surprisingly begin to relax Get Your Private Free Email at 
<17893531.1075840083134.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,2000-02-17 00:16:00,Cc I wrote the following last month while I was in Northern Cyprus Hope you enjoy it Maras The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Attached to the rusting chainlink fence I am approaching are several blood red signs on which are stenciled both the black silhouette of the top half of a faceless soldier holding a rifle and a warning in Turkish that Fotograf Cekmek Yasaktir To Take Photographs Is Forbidden The fence no longer quite plumb in the soft sand seems to stumble across the beach eventually ending at a gently lapping Mediterranean There a tangle of wires attached to the fence extends a short way into the surf making anyones effort to outflank it obviously intentional The Turkish soldiers patrolling the nonmans land beyond to the south could thus treat such an intruder I suppose in whatever way they might see fit In the other direction the fence before it has completely left the beach cuts sharply north running in front of the hulks of four empty resort hotels Above them in the deep blue of the predusk sky hangs a crescent moon the same phased moon that graces the flags of both Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus One of the hotels still has the remnants of an identifying sign with just two of its six letter Greek name remaining Another hotel the smallest and no doubt at one time the quaintest has slatted wooden shutters covering the windows and doors leading out to tiny porches Some of the shutters have rusted off their hinges then fallen forward against the porch railings and now point out to sea as if giving urgent warning Others hang limply defeated from a single remaining hinge Most surprisingly every one of the windows I can see in the hotels is either missing or broken I am taken back by such thoroughness given that the most likely motivation was vindictiveness I struggle to find a loftie r one wondering if there was perhaps some valid security consideration such as making these somewhat strategically set buildings unattractive to squatters Maybe though I find this thought the most troubling it ha d been done just for the fun of it The fence I am walking along marks the border between inhabited and uninhabited Maras the Turkish Cypriots name for the town Greek Cypriots call Varosha The uninhabited part has been off limits since the Turkish army invaded Cyprus in Before that invasion the small Turkish Cyprio t minority had lived uneasily amongst the Greek Cypriot majority though in the years since when Cyprus was given its independence by the English periodic outbreaks of intercommunal violence had led to increased segregation and emigration The invasion launched after a coup on the island and another particularly vicious spat of violence eventually put an end to even this limited association as it did the worst of the violence The Turkish army went on to occupy roughly the northern most of the island which was accompanied and followed by one of the last centurys all too familiar mass crossmigrations The northern half is now home to nearly all of the islands Turkish Cypriots close to of the total population The border between the north and south known as the Atilla Line is one of the many UN patrolled blue lines in the world Maras actually falls within Northern Cyprus with the Attila Line further to the south It is controlled now by the Turkish army At the time of the invasion the town had been a thriving up and coming resort town run mostly by Greek Cypriots Indeed all over Cyprus since its independence despite the periodic deadly violence tourism had been booming But here in Maras at least the boom is no more The forty or so thousand Greek Cypriots who once owned ran or otherwise worked there fled in panic before the advancing Turkish army reportedly leaving behind uncleared breakfast dishe s on tables and washing on lines some forgetting to turn off lights that burned on and on for years UN sponsored proximity talks between the North and the South called proximity talks because the negotiating leaders will not met face to face started in New York on December th They are set to continue in Geneva this January st The return of Maras to its former mostly Greek Cypriot owners or more precisely their return to it is no doubt high on this meetings thus far secret agenda as it has been over the years at the many similar though always fruitless negotiations This time around however expectations are running higher than usual primarily because of a positive change in the dynamic between the two sides by far most important sponsor states Turkey and Greece Turkey for example has recently acquired candidacy status within the European Union which commits it to resolving among other things its disputes with EU member Greece Greece o n the other hand has lately suffered a series of embarrassments on the international stage the biggest of which was being caught last February having given sanctuary to fugitive Kurdish separatist leader and terrorist in most peoples minds Abdullah Apo Ocalan Coupled with th e significant good will garnered in the wake of the tremendous assistance Turkey and Greece gave each other after their twin earthquake disasters las t year the two countries just may be willing to push their client states toward a deal The point where the fence meets the sea marks the end of the gentle curve o f the short beach I am walking Behind me at this beachs other end is inhabited Maras nicest hotel oddly sporting an English name the Palm Beach Hotel If you looked in that direction taking in only the fine hotel the attractive beach the dark blue sea you might think you were in a tourist paradise But this is no paradise As I walk the last few feet to the fence I begin to see another beach emerge much longer than the one I am on sweeping south most of the way to the horizon There are more hotels which I knew from what I had read were also empty But my reading has not prepared me for the monstrous proportions of it all First in the distance one two three empty hotels quickly come into view then more slowly dozens more At the fence with the entire beach now visible I count more than thirty of them and these just on the waterfront Just beyond the fence are a few pieces of ancient playground equipment scattered about the sand I try to imagine the happy cries of the children as their parents more than twenty five years before pushed them round an d round in dizzying circles on the miniature merrygoaround now rusted and partially buried by drifted sand There is a long slide too though halftumbled down one of its rusted supports having twisted and collapsed after so many years of weather and neglect My own memories of childhood end at no such place now trapped inside a militarized nomans land How different life must seem to those whose memories do What sorts of dreams are built on this type of innocence lost I turn around and walk to the Palm Beach Hotel along the way wondering if it was merely luck that had left it on the business side of the fence On its porch I chose a chair since it has become cold near a partly cracked door through which comes a warm draft I order a cup of tea As the evening grows darker so does the abandoned town spread out before me The crescent moon is now higher in the sky and together with a strategically placed star provides a tiny bright exclamation point over the entire disma l scene below At that moment two energetic young men burst through the door The bigger of the two is gripping the arm of the other directing him forward to the porchs railing Bak look he says in Turkish gesturing out toward the sea with a broad sweep of his free arm Harika degil mi Wonderful isnt it Evet cok guzel Yes very beautiful his friend agrees They stand gazing out over the sea though after a brief moment I see the smaller mans head turn toward the darkened hulks that line the shore The bigger man glances at his friend sees where he is looking then looks himself They are both silent for quite some time before the bigger man returns his attention to his friend squeezes his arm His friend as if awakening from a trance slowly pulls his gaze from the ruins smiles up at his companion After two identical simultaneous shrugs they chuckle uneasily shaking their heads as they do When they turn to return to the door I holler out to them Baris mumkun m u Is peace possible They stop look at me with frowns of curiosity Nerelisiniz Where are yo u from It is the big one who had taken the lead Amerikaliyim Im an American His frown deepens though now for a different reason Belki dort bes yil sonra Maybe four five years from now belki hic bir zaman yok maybe never Ama ne hakkinda otuz bir ocak bir yeni baris gurusmesi But what about January st the new peace negotiations Hah he exclaims interrupting me Her zamen yeni baris gorumesi var There are always new peace negotiations He thereupon dismisses my inference with the same sweeping arm gesture he used to introduce to his friend the sea Get Your Private Free Email at

<3699202.1075840094586.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-04-05 21:20:00,Cc This is the first day of the Kurban Bayram Holiday of the Sacrifice and Istanbuls streets are full of folks in their holiday best And blood For days cows lambs goats rams and other big animals have been being brought to Istanbul from the countryside I read that in Cairo you could see people bringing their animals in by cab Tent cites consisting of rickety structures of unlumbered wood and huge plastic tarps full of these doomed animals have sprung up under bridges in garbage filled lots and along the highways The citys normal perfume of car exhaust and coal fumes is now mixed with the heavy smells of the barnyard And today the slaughter began Pools of blood and rain spotted the pavement in front of my building evidence of a recent butchering On a muddy hillside in one of the older neighborhoods south of the Halic Golden Horn in Eski Old Istanbul I saw several women all smiling surrounding a man vigorously chopping away at the rib cage of a cow with an ax The cows recently skinned hide was spread out neatly beside them the rest of the animal in a heap nearby I passed three men loading sagging plastic sacks no doubt full of the spoils of a recent kill into the trunk of a car Sorry but my weak imagination couldnt help but conjure up to images from Scorceses Goodfellas By a mosque three was a lone Rams head under a tree Its snout was pointing upwards as if thinking about stretching a neck that was no longer there to the leaves just above it On the sidewalk in front of a butcher shop a man hacking off the skin of a decapitated lamb rolled the body back and forth like a water balloon A few meters away a pen full of sheep ate their feed contentedly from a trough I looked closely at them was surprised to see that they seemed oblivious to the significance of what was going on right next to them Mounds of entrails lay in the gutter of one street I walked bye the opening of a narrow alley from which I was assaulted by a draft bloated with the now unpleasant order of fresh meat Later I watched with absolutely no idea what it meant a young man put his fingers into the blood runoff of one butchering then walk to his car and wipe it on the license plate The Kurban Bayram is an extremely important holiday for Moslems second only Ramadon Ramazon in Turkish Its the time for the hajj hac in Turkish or pilgrimage to Mecca which all Moslems of any means are to make at least once in their lifetimes Here in Turkey most folks get at least two days off work some the entire week During the holiday throughout the Moslem world many families buy an entire animal for sacrifice using only a part of it themselves giving the bulk of it to others including most importantly the poor Some play amateur butcher but I have been told the vast majority of them have an expert do it Indeed the Koran demands that the sacrifice be as quick and painless as possible The holiday itself celebrates the Old Testament story in which Ibrahim Abraham to nonMoslems was ordered by God to sacrifice his son Abraham reluctantly agreed but was given a last minute reprieve and was allowed to sacrifice a ram instead It is a powerful story about belief and faith and must give animal rightists a few textual problems I can see why Moslems have picked the story out as paramount It certainly provides an interesting contrast to the New Testament story of Gods sacrifice of his son As I walked around Istanbul today I overwhelmed The city was a slaughterhouse full of for me somewhat gruesome contrasts Young girls in flowered dresses and boys in tiny threepiece suits ran around the streets laughing and playing games with blood on their shoes I passed a curious boy kicking at some unfortunate creatures stomach which had been left on a pile of garbage I saw a little girl holding her mothers hand smiling at me shyly as her mom picked through a pile of discarded intestines April My discontent at the sights of the Kurban I concluded later was a bit sanctimonious Americans eat considerable more meat than Turks its only that in the United States the dismemberment is done quite a bit more discretely But why should it be Isnt it a better or at least a lot more honest to understand what the animal part and animal youre eating looked like when it was still alive including rippling muscles forlorn gaze and all I thought of my canoe trips to Canada and how much more meaningful my fish dinner was because I had caught and cleaned the unlucky critter myself A sharpening of reality I think is always a good thing especially in this time when so much of our knowledge and experience comes secondhand through the media including I have to reluctantly admit my beloved books If our rituals often the most powerful means of creating realityblindness can be infused with as much truth as possible all the better Id say Then perhaps when those flimsy dreams we try to kid ourselves with disintegrate like pieces of wet toilet paper Today is the fivemonth anniversary of my arrival here in Istanbul Its an amazing thing Ive done for myself I think I am as close to totally engaged in my life and the world around me as I have ever been It will be hard to live any other way again I imagine In the last week and a half three terrorists here in Turkey succeeded only in blowing themselves up much I suppose to their martyred souls chagrin Ive got to hope that these crazy acts are evidence of the PKK or whomever being on its last legs There are important elections national and local coming up on April th so well probably get a chance to see just how long those legs are Hope all is well Drop me a line MarkO Get Your Private Free Email at

trust that we have chosen right WH Auden The view from my living room a southern view begins with a mess of red tiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic Golden Horn On the other side of the Halic a riverharbor once beautiful and fast flowing now stalled and polluted are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium later to be called Constantinople later still Istanbul was founded nearly six centuries before the birth of Christ Above a cement colored smear of apartment buildings of much more recent vintage I can make out the outlines of towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the s AD I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques built in the s during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman Suleyman the Magnificent Otherwise the hillsides of Eski Old Istanbul are covered by the before mentioned apartment buildings relatively new but already appearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement They are I suppose full of people who for the most part work far too much for far too little and who must wonder more and more with each passing day about the relevance of their muezzins cries Incongruously hundreds maybe thousands of sea gulls screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters dip and rise in the air space between me and all of that I recently bought a cheap guitar I left a better one back in the States from my friend Ilyas and from time to time I sit looking out my window while playing sad songs from Americas south the easiest kind to play slow with three chords and as Bono pretentiously said the truth This evening I did just that singing and playing among others a song by Steve Earle in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long ago love Was I off somewhere or maybe just too high and one by Lucinda Williams who sings about hitting the road in order to forget When I get to Baton Rouge I wont cry a tear for you A pile of clouds staacked up on the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset but the invisible sun still makes its presence know bordering them crimson I watch the neddlelike vapor trail of a jet crawl west until it too disappears behind the clouds all the time wondering about when I too will be heading in that same direction What will it be like to be in America again I dont think Ive ever developed particularly deep psychic connections with places though that is not to say I havent loved the places Ive lived I truly adore San Francisco and I always come to Dallass defense I appreciate Aurora Illinois and miss Westfield New Jersey often wondering what it would have been like to have finished my growing up there But because perhaps I ultimately value experience more than comfort and dont get me wrong I value comfort a great deal maybe I havent been able to convince myself at some critical fundamental level to believe that settling down in one place or come to think of it with one person for the rest of my life is an ultimate goal Of course I worry about where this all might lead with the specter of absolute and perhaps God forbid unbearable loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility But then again maybe Im just looking for the ultimate home and will burrow in deeply once Ive found it My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home after what was for me at least a wonderful tenday visit They werent so sure about the Boza a sweet slightly fermented drink made from millet I accosted them with at a tiny caf in the center of Eski Istanbul but they tried it anyway Later forgetting about how scared I had been the first time I was there I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on a postdusk walk through the working class Kucuk Pazar neighborhood on our way to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the Suleymaniye Mosque While passing through Kucuk Pazar we turned into one particularly poorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in near total darkness I could only tell they were smoking by the occasional flare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes After first not knowing what in the world wed stumbled onto I realized we were passing near a hamam Turkish public bath no doubt an immensely important institution in Kucuk Pazar as many of the apartments there I have been told have no showers Notwithstanding these and a few other nonstarters I still think Misha and Ninas trip was a success We did and saw a lot albiet while suffering through the hot humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer Probably of most significance to me was checking in with Misha after nearly nine months apart We had much to talk about or at least to allude to vaguely During one of our more memorable ie ridiculous jaunts into these wordy nevernever lands which occurred on the roof porch of my building and lasted until four in the morning Misha was patient and courteous when I suggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood space between an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understand department In response I referred to some of the books Ive read This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons though I plan on studying Turkish a lot for example translating newspaper articles and writing and with the help of Ismail and Sukran trying to absorb more deeply all that I have learned to date And I have learned a lot including an incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary Still I wonder if this old dog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where to lay down afterwards My biggest problem among many I know is hearing Turkish My two most used sentences are Ne dediniz What did you say and Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz Can you say that again I will be buying a television ugh as Ive concluded that a television is an important way to learn how to hear Turkish Most importantly this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writing program writing for a least three hours a day five days a week Insallah With gods help That coupled with work and Turkish and my reading should keep me pretty busy and hopefully productive At least I should be sending a few more emails More later MarkO Get Your Private Free Email at

Thanks again for the communication Like I said in earlier note things seem pretty normal Stores without electricty but open No one seems to be hoarding Indeed except for lack of electricity I really wouldnt know anything happened and I walked around for a couple hours covering some ground It was strange but I had great trouble getting to sleep last night and probably only did so minutes before the quake Next couple hours was spont outdoors with the rest of my neighbors Took a pretty good walk then too and again saw little damage though admittedly it was the middle of the night The one good thing is that for the first time in my stay here the stars were all out as the city had gone dark Quite an experience More later Mark From To Mark Skilling Subject UPDATE before heading home for the

from you as they become possible Mom and Dad are on following this online as well I called them the minute the bulletins started coming across on the earthquake and Mom saw it on television shortly afterward We had CNN video of some of the victims on our midnight news tonight so were just starting to see what has happened there AP is now saying at least are dead and reporting that at least buildings in Istanbul have crumbled I guess Izmit miles east of you in Instabulyoull know where these cities are has been hardest hit with of the deaths there And an oil refinery is said to be on fire in the city of Bursa where six are reported dead If this story is like so many others at this point were only starting to get the picture It sounds like a messand the aftershocks are always said to be frightening Were all very concerned about you after this Markbut I cant begin to tell you how relieved we were to hear from you I hope youre really all right We know communications are apt to be sporadic in coming days but well await word on how youre doingI couldnt get over the fact you were able to get through to us so quickly I know battery power for your laptop is at a premium and that

<13060580.1075840094897.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-08-20 01:36:00,August The afternoon ezan is as if a lament The muezzins voice seems fuller more emotional and he sings strong and slow Because the electricity in my neighborhood had been off most of the day apparently as a precaution against fire it was the first amplified call to prayer I have heard today But it is not for us he wails My neighborhood has been relatively untouched some fallen masonry an empty top floor apartment overlooking the square surrounding the Galata Tower half collapsed debris from it partially blocking the road that circles the square Thousands are suspected dead in an incredible series of earthquakes the first a possible and unfathomable on the Richter scale that began this morning at Images on the TV are horrific a five story building off its foundation leaning against the building next to it a warehouse its roof collapsed on fire the top half of a minaret toppled a bridge severed neatly into four parts collapsed Worse yet dozens of apartment buildings flattened into cruel piles of concrete beams and slabs twisted steel reinforcement and rubble A handsome father breaks down in the arms of friends in front of one such monstrosity At another a reporter shoves her microphone into a hole under a concrete beam interviews someone trapped there the camera then panning back to show an impossible heap of debris above I had trouble getting to sleep last night which was unusual Ismail and I had spent a fine evening at one of our favorite outdoor cafs under trees whose leaves were gently tussled by a breeze coming down the Bosphorus Nearby was the impressive bulk of the Nusretiye Mosque built by Sultan Mahmut the Second some years ago to celebrate his victory over the corrupt Janissary a kind of special guard to the Sultan We spoke of writing of nationalism about my upcoming trip to the States about learning a new language about a possible trip together in the winter along the coast of the Aegean Sea We were both particularly buoyant with the worst of the summer heat and humidity seemingly behind us In retrospect it was as if we were summing some things up a minor period in our lives over a new one soon to begin I returned home around midnight lay in my bed mulling absurdly over possible problems that might arise on trips that are many weeks away The last time I looked at my watch it was well after am It seemed that something woke me up other than the shaking though Im not sure It may have been dogs barking a person yelling or the birds Perhaps it was simply the first gentle movements of the quake triggering deeply imbedded memories and fears from the quake I experienced in San Francisco I was up out of my bed though still half a sleep before it got really bad There was a crazy mess of sounds from wood and metal and whatever squeaking and creaking around me The movement and sounds confused me at first and I remember thinking for a moment or two that there were other people in my place and that this was the problem Soon however there was no question what was happening By then I was in my hallway where three doorways were close together The first moments of a serious earthquake when you are up in a building are as if the earth below is swelling the building riding those swells like waves Then it gets awful out of control and it is nothing at all like the comfort of riding waves I felt the sickening feeling of my building being all too easily whipped around from side to side and otherwise Though it was dark the ceilings walls and floors all seemed at absurd new angles visavis each other The shaking was bad enough I could imagine that things might start collapsing From time to time I darted out of the relatively safety of the hallway to grab my sweats a jacket my bag Soon the shaking stopped I heard it lasted some seconds and then I really started racing to get outside I must have been soaked with adrenaline by this point remembering to grab my Turkish dictionary a flashlight which unfortunately wasnt assembled I did that later and I had to root around the drawer for the batteries some extra cash even my camera The electricity stayed on for a bit which was helpful but was off by the time I opened my door a minute or two later My place is five stories up on the top floor and theres a veranda off to one side Perhaps unwisely though I couldnt resist I went out on it for a quick look out over the city It was dark except for a moving light here and there the headlights of cars Something may have been burning across the Golden Horn in the Balat neighborhood I could see the silhouettes of a few of the great Mosques against a sky now full of beautiful stars Below a car alarm had gone off and people were yelling and shouting I worked my way carefully down the stairs concerned that they may have collapsed I spent most of the next two or three hours with the crowd that had gathered in the relative safety of the square around the Galata Tower though I occasionally shot a worried look up at that huge mass looming above us At one point I took a long walk further up my hill then along Istiklal Caddesi my part of the citys main street Other than the electricity being out and the people on the streets there was little physical evidence of the earthquake Some masonry had fallen As I mentioned above an abandoned apartment was half collapsed near my place I saw no one hurt But I did saw people in their underwear a women mumbling about Mohammed in one hand a water bottle the other with its palm turned up to the sky which as I said was starry Some people were laughing others were crying most were huddled together in small groups talking quietly Many of the women were wearing headscarves more than usual it seemed An outdoor caf next to the tower opened and served tea and water I knew a few people there and with my poor Turkish learned that in was really bad in Izmit sixty of so miles east of here that even here in Istanbul a few buildings may have collapsed Dawn came and I returned to my apartment slept for a few hours That sleep was interrupted and made fitful by what I learned later were a series of fairly significant aftershocks On the television a crowd just burst into applause A young boy has been rescued from one collapsed building Except for being dusty he appears unscathed As they carry him to an ambulance a reporter follows asking him questions Were you scared Cok kokum very scared He seems pleased to be back in the world by the attention hes getting Then he is asked about his family His eyes grow wide his face long Annem my mother kardesim my sisterbrother sesleri duydum I heard their voices Duydum By the time they reach the

<3747816.1075840095003.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-08-23 12:13:00,Re Thanks for the wonderful updates and stay safe and healthy Cc Thakns again for your concern Youre asking a lot of good questions The best indication my building is ok is that its standing and that its contemporaires are all standing as well You may have read that the buildings that fell for the most part are of new vintage and are in the lowlands Mine is neither Spoke to my landlord today who is an engineer of some sort and for what its worth he said the building is a good one About shots I got all ones recommended by my doctor before I left SF though he wasnt planning for one of the worst natural disasters in our time Im keeping my eye out about the how and why of the spread of the diseases theyre worried about here but am pretty sure that one cirterion is that you have to be pretty darn close which Im not Im not our sticking my nose into anything though would love to see things up close for curiositys sake Trouble is Id just be getting in the way which I dont want to do So will for now restrict myself to giving a little cash and observing what goes on here on the home front The damage really is not apparent from here As I mentioned in my note to dad things are pretty darn normal Expect indirect impact to be visable like worsening inflation for example But thats about it Will keep an eye out for trouble though More later Thanks again for taking the time to write Its always nice to hear from you Love Mark From To Mark Skilling Subject Thanks for the wonderful updates and stay safe and healthy Date Sat Aug Mark Thank YOU for your notes Had we not heard from you our lives here would have proceeded in terror We wouldnt know where to begin trying to find you and the troubles there seem so far flung and numerous that Im sure no on in authority could have taken the time to help They have their hands full The fact that your building held up and that were not looking on helplessly like the poor devils we see on television must do knowing loved ones are dying or dead beneath mounds of shattered concrete underscores Moms lucky star notiona comment we made to each other as we talked earlier today I am relieved to hear you are able to obtain food Theyre saying disease is spreading in the wake of thisespecially with the heat thats underway Please Mark be careful Your accounts of events there are extraordinary but Id rather have you safe and well then threatened by illness or harm at the hands of these aftershocks were hearing about The wire services are reporting the official death toll at but add that are missing beneath the rubble many presumed dead Concern about the spread of disease is being raised not only because of decaying corpses under building but because of the number of people forced to sleep outdoors without toilets or proper sanitation The water is a source of concern Its appearing this may rival the s quake there said to have killed I dont know much about the spread of disease or the way you protect yourself against its spread I presume you were innoculated before going over Mark If not can you get shots anywhere now Your accounts are extraordinary and you give us insight into the environment which preceded and followed this debacle Please be careful Mark Id rather have you healthygiven a choice between that and news of whats happening there Are you satisfied your building is safe to return to Will food become a problem as this situation continues Also what happens when the weather starts turning colderwhere are all the homeless going to live It doesnt sound like the authorities there can get a handle on something this widespread and devastatingat least not anytime in the near future at least Thanks for all the news Markand please be careful and take care of yourself Im not sure exactly what we can do for you from this distance but I did see Jeffs email offering to help through Enron shipments Will close nowits midnight Friday night and Im seeing double nothing new about that right Youre in all of our thoughts Mark Love Tom Reply Separator Subject Re Concern about you from back homeTHURSDAY evening PM Author Mark Skilling at InternetTCO Date AM Tom Thanks again fro your thoughtful notes Cant say life normal but in areas without damage not to far away from it Plenty of food No hoarding Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normal loads on a daily basis just like before Of course things will be taxed by the demands of the rescue and restoration but looks like the suffering will be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones And what a lot of suffering that will be Do have access to my building It is on solid ground and is older which in Turkey ironically means safer Still spent two of the last three nights sleeping outside with millions of others Again my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me Sukran too and have been able to enjoy his and his friends company On these nights every open space not too close to a building seems to be filled with people sleeping on blankets jackets etc Some have strung string between things trees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets made relatively cozy little spots for themselves It continues to amaze me how kind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here though I did hear of one poor old fellow got his shoes stolen perhaps he simply absent mindely misplaced them Everyone though is tramatized tired and sad And what you read about impact on attempts to get economy which has been hit hard by Russian crisis going unfortuantely appear right on the mark Wish Turkey all the luck in the world It will need it Able to watch the local news though obviously dont understand a lot of what theyre saying Still the pictures tell enough More later Nice to know youre thinking about me Let dad and mom know not taking any chances that werent there already Love Mark From To Subject Concern about you from back homeTHURSDAY evening PM cdt Date Thu Aug Dear Mark We continue to follow your emails and the news reports on the earthquke disaster there Wanted to drop you a note before heading home for the night Im concerned about your well being and wondering if youve daredor have been allowedback in your apartment News reports here indicate many are sleeping outsideand being encouraged to do so by the goverment there who fears buildings have been weakened and may succomb to powerful afterschocks Reportedly the Kandilli Observatory there reported aftershocks in just hours today Thursday Reports were getting here put the death toll at with injured The UN says are still buried and feared dead and its experts are saying most who are saved after a disaster like this are saved in the first hoursits been at least hours as I write this to you They say the smell of decomposing bodies is flooding some sections of the countrys hardest hit cities and that there is fear of spreading disease I see the US has ordered Marines and Navy sailors in and told them to step up rescue efforts Were also told something like countriesincluding Israel Germany France Britain and Japan are dispatching rescue teams and equipment The news wires and television reports are covering other US rescuers who are heading over but fear its too late It sounds from your emails like your neighborhood escaped the worst of the damage But I wonder how safe you feel your building is after the shake it endured Also wonder whether you can get adequet food and water and whether phone and electrical service is regular and reliable I cant tell you how relieved we were to receive the quick communication minutes the other night Wed have been worried sick about your wellbeing Clearly news reports center on the hardest hit areasso its hard to picture how normal your life is in the wake of the quake There is real concern being expressed on our news here about how the masses left homeless by this disaster are going to be housed in the coming cold seasonwhich isnt all that far away I also saw a notation on one of the wire stories that recent economic movestermed fairly severe in news reportsby the government there to get inflation under control made this an especially inoportune time for this disaster to hit Hope youre doing all right Mark and I join Dad in urging care I guess they had a point something quake north of SFO just the other evening and the disaster there has the earthquake concerns in vulnerable parts of this country very much in the news The Turkey quake has led national news here since it happened and a new cable system installed in my building lets me see all the CNN servicesincluding CNN Internationalso I think Im seeing what you can see of CNN there Please be careful and keep us posted on how youre doing We really appreciate all of your emails to date I love you Mark Tom Get Your Private Free Email at Get Your Private Free Email at 
<7886757.1075840095035.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-08-25 20:35:00,Re ITS FABULOUS Cc From previous notes which I bccd to you looks like Im in business Ive really appreciated your two recent emails as I have all of them Had gone to the Tribune web site something Id done before in order to show my friends here your picture and brag a bit looking for info on percepctive section but probably due to my bad searches didnt unearth it You explanation was very important Also important were your comments on what struck you about what Ive been writing Those kind of comments are the best kind Often when writing its hard to know what works and what doesnt work Perhaps the most important thing however is that the article will be published by Tom Skillings brother Though nothings been published yet and I shouldnt write as if thats a certainty afraid of bad luck would never had gotten close to this opportunity without you Im very grateful Love you and looking forward to both of us experiencing how this ol newspaper media machine works something with which I guess you are all to familiar MarkO From To Mark Skilling Subject ITS FABULOUS Date Wed Aug Mark My read on this is that its terrific You personalize this tragedy in a way only one familiar with the area and its people can You take me through the whole experience in a way Ive not visited the subject before Im not an editorbut it strikes me that this is just the sort of insight into a calamatous event of our day that the Tribune seeks in its Perspective section Editing is always a devil and I suspect you are a lot better at it than I amknowing the subject as completely as you do You probably are right that introducing the reader right up front to the notion this is about the unimaginable tragedy about which weve been hearing for days now is a good idea But my sense is that youve infused this piece with an on the ground and there feel which can only come from one uniquely familiar with this devastated city and region Youre definitely on the right track Mark Congratulations It will be interesting to how the Perspective people feel I think theyre going to be pleased What a job Thanks for sharing this with me Mark Look forward to hearing how this proceeds As Ive said before youre introducing me to a place and events with which I have no personal familiarity After reading your work I feel a kinship with the people and place and the misery thats been imposed on them and it by nature Fascinating Love you Mark This is no easy assignmentyet youve done a beautiful job in trying circumstances Again congratulations Tom Reply Separator Subject no subject Author Mark Skilling at InternetTCO Date AM Dear Bill Hope all is well The piece which is cut and pasted in below is a too long now at some words The first paragraph could go I suppose though I think it gets in some historical information that has not been in anything else Ive been reading Also I think it is important that Turkey has for many years been caught in a tremendous struggle accommodating its rich cultural heritage with the demands of the present Its fair to say that this struggle is one of the main reasons I first became interested in Turkey The present suffered a huge setback with the quake in that not only did the modern secular government fail terribly but so did the modern buildings That the repairs to the old city wall crumbled but the not ancient wall itself seems an apt symbol of this Maybe the stuff on San Francisco can go though I guess it is interesting that I lived through both experiences Also the paragraph about prequake hospitality is not really necessary Perhaps a more general pruning job rather than the crude removal of entire paragraphs would do the job Then again you will probably have all together different ideas I look forward to working with you all on this Mark From my living room I look down a hill over a collection of red tiled rooftops to the Golden Horn This river once beautiful and fast flowing is now stalled and polluted On the other side of the Golden Horn are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium later to be called Constantinople later still Istanbul was founded some thousand years ago Above a cement colored smear of apartment buildings of much more recent vintage I can make out the outlines of towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the sixth century nearly thousand years ago They are now rotten with age though parts had recently been rebuilt for tourists Some of these restored parts collapsed during last Tuesdays earthquake The ancient parts were left untouched Less than a block away is the minaret of our small neighborhood mosque From here you can hear five times a day its ezan or call to prayer That call is now as if a lament The muezzins voice seems fuller more emotional than usual He sings in Arabic which I dont understand but Ive read that his call reminds the believers that God is most great and tells them to Come to prayer come to prosperity I listen carefully for signs of doubt about Gods mercy and compassion But I detect no doubt at all Instead it is simply beautiful and sad and despite not understanding what he sings very moving In the past few days I have heard many sad tired people say automatically and surprisingly without bitterness that Allah verir Allah alir God gives God takes away And much has been taken away The death toll from last Tuesdays earthquake is likely to exceed with an equal number injured Up to have been left homeless Millions more in the days immediately following the quake chose to sleep outdoors including me afraid of the aftershocks All over Istanbul in the parks and squares even on narrow medians between busy streets entire families spent the days and nights on blankets spread out on the ground In the grassy Hippodrome along side the spectacular Blue Mosque and in the gardens between that same mosque and the Sancta Sophia where you would normally expect hundreds of tourists to be milling about it was as if a great migration was taking place Many of the women wore brightly colored headscarves Other women despite the heat were dressed from head to toe in more somber black Some families brought portable propane burners to make the their beloved tea Many more had lugged along pillows and mattresses others string and rope which they strung between trees and posts and hung sheets for a bit of privacy On the nights immediately after the quake I was grateful to receive an invitation to join my friend Ismails family and the family of a friend of his to spend the night in a little park in the hills above the Bosphorus Bridge The Bosphorus Bridge is a huge modern suspension bridge connecting Europe and Asia that looks like a gray version of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco With the bridges hulk looming seemingly helplessly below us I shared a corner of a colorful Turkish blanket covering the ground We drank tea smoked cigarettes and joked about being gocebe nomads and about the Turks finally returning to their forgotten nomadic roots I practiced my Turkish with the children who unlike most older Turks were able to correct me in English During the night while I slept someone put a jacket over me Now that the rains and cooler weather have come and the experts have given an allclear sign most of us have returned to our homes Back in my apartment I glance at my walls at my ceilings find it impossible not to think of all those still buried underneath theirs Last night at our favorite tea garden I joined Ismail and his wife Dilek who had just learned that three of her cousins had died in Adapazari We talked about whether people here will ever be able to forget return to something of a normal life It hadnt started raining yet so we stayed late admitted to being a bit nervous about returning home The government and the army are being severely criticized in the local press and on the streets as are the construction contractors There have been other problems as well In an open area near the caf I mentioned above where dozens of families had come to spend the night an old man had his shoes stolen I was told the story of a Turk in Yalova one of the hardest hit areas selling bottled water for million TL dollars ten times the normal price That profiteer however was apparently beaten subsequently by the storyteller himself while a nearby policeman did nothing to intervene Yet notwithstanding the widespread and no doubt legitimate anger at the official response that of ordinary Turks has been overwhelming and impressive A large truck from my relatively poor working class neighborhood was quickly filled with needed supplies water bread medicine and sent to one disaster site The company of one of my students sent along a similar truckload of supplies and has now set up a fund to collect money for the homeless The same is true of business group to which the company of a dear friend of mine Sukran belongs Efforts like these have been going on everywhere In addition thousands of people from all over Turkey have gone to the stricken areas to help including Kurds who want to prove their commitment to the Turkish State I recall the criticism I heard after the San Francisco World Series Earthquake which I unfortunately experienced as well Though admittedly a much less serious affair the cries about lax enforcement of building codes were similar Everyone promised to do better and I hope they have I recall my own pathetic plans never implemented to prepare for the next big one I had cut an article out of the paper which listed the emergency supplies that should be kept close on hand Though I kept that list near to the top of my pile of important papers over the years it simply grew yellow and torn I finally threw it away at the time I packed up for my move to Istanbul Significantly before I left San Francisco last fall damage from that quake was still being repaired some ten years later and complaints could still be heard about the governments continuing failure to enforce building codes rigorously enough My experience since coming to Istanbul has been one of almost unending Turkish hospitality I could have been left alone but was not When I first came here on vacation some two years ago I meet a fine man Ilyas who makes Saz a stringed musical instrument that is as important here as the guitar is in America and bought a beautiful one from him When I returned to Istanbul this time to live I visited Ilyas again to say hello and talk about possible Saz lessons When he learned I was looking for an apartment he took most of the next day off and showed me around his neighborhood eventually helping me to find the place I now live The lessons he eventually gave me were free My friend Ismail has spent countless hours with me roaming the city looking for deals on used furniture He and his wife have also lent me a beautiful rug a blanket and several other very useful items in my apartment I occasionally get gifts from my students and never an unkind word from anyone After the earthquake itself several of my Turkish friends kept in constant touch with me Several days ago on the television I saw and heard a crowd burst into applause A young boy had just been rescued from one of the many collapsed buildings Except for being dusty he appeared unscathed As they carried him to an ambulance a reporter followed asking him questions Were you scared Cok korktum very scared He response was perky He was clearly delighted to be back in the world by the attention he was getting Then he was asked about his family His eyes grew wide his face long Annem my mother kardesim my sisterbrother sesleri duydum I heard their voices Duydum By the time they reached the ambulance he was screaming Sesleri duydum Sesleri duydum I hope the rest of the world hears Turkeys cries for help Insallah daha iyi olacak With Gods help things will be better Insallah Turkiye iyi sanslar From all of us good luck August Istanbul Turkey Get Your Private Free Email at Get Your Private Free Email at

strange to think that right now as I write this you are on the set at WGN in the middle of the news program perhaps putting a few finishing touches on your graphics Just as I got up a few minutes ago I got up early which is the best time to get through to the line I share and also because Im excited and at the exact time I turned on the computor there was a flash of lightening outside Then moments later just as a healthy downpour began the muezzin started singing outside This is true no lie I thought to myself I hope there arent any more cosmic coincidences such as a well you know Ill be on line for a bit so maybe well be able to talk on this thing almost as if in person Love Mark From To Mark Skilling Subject Editing etc Date Thu Aug Hi Mark Below is an edited version of your piece Weve got a few questions which Ive indicated parenthetically through the story Most of the editing is designed to tighten things a little And weve reorganized some sentences to clarify meaning This is an interesting moment in the writereditor relationship and I regret that were experiencing it in cyberspace Its hard to show you each change and explain it but hopefully theyll be more or less selfexplanatory if you compare the edited version with a printout of the original story In any case be of good cheer this is not an extraordinary amount of editing Id suggest that you answer our questions and raise any points about editing within the story just as we have done and then email the whole story back Ill try again to call you Friday Youll see some strange characters in the text

<13000625.1075840095266.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,markskilling@hotmail.com,1999-12-28 01:55:00,Cc Ive cut and pasted in below a piece that should be published in the Turkish Daily News the English language paper here later this week Its a first person piece about my experience of a Christmas service here last year a lot of which youll recognize from last year Ugh Im already repeating myself and Ive just started though really had no choice as needed to get it out before the holiday itself Since this year Christmas again fell during the Muslim Holy Month of Ramadan the piece is sort of year neutral Happy holidays MarkO Christmas Day Istanbul The priest mutters his deeply accented English into the microphone which amplifies and further distorts his voice His bluntly pronounced words rebound through the vast freezing hall of Saint Antoine Cathedral They tell a story familiar to me about the Son of God being sent to earth to die for our sins But here in the middle of this enormous Muslim City the story sounds strange and almost subversive And indeed the Christ story is at the center of the great Christian and Muslim divide Muslims accept only that Christ was a prophet sent by God rejecting vehemently that Christ is his son They see Mohammeds prophecy and the Koran as prompted by the need to correct the mistaken elevation by the Gospel of Christ from the flesh to the divine The priest appears relieved to turn things over to an African man who in a bizarre contrast to the priests gold embroidered robe is wearing a big stuffed yellow ski jacket His English is much better as he announces that we are now to sing a hymn The songs words handwritten and in English are flashed up onto a screen by an overhead projector The lyrics are basic There are several identical stanzas that simply invite Jesus to come I grimace slightly when I see that these are followed by a poorly translated chorus which asks for the Son of God to come will be born in our heart I glance over at Ismail a Muslim friend who has come with me to the service He smiles gives me a wink His English is excellent and I am sure he notices the mistake I look around at the rest of the people in the sanctuary The pews are not even a third full This is the first service of the day and is completely in English It will be followed by an Italian and a Turkish one The crowd at the Turkish service Ismail tells me will overflow into the courtyard in front of the Cathedral and will consist mostly of Muslims curious to see a Christmas service Apparently some members of St Antoines permanent congregation are angry about this since many of them will be unable to find a place to sit Some may even being forced to stand out in the cold Christmas Day this year falls within the Muslim holy Month of Ramadan during which the faithful are to fast between sunrise and sunset or more precisely according to the Koran between the times one can discern a white thread from a black one Ramadan is celebrated during the ninth month of the Muslim calendar which is a lunar one in the solar calendar it occurs days earlier each year My day had started well before dawn when I was awoken by our neighborhoods Ramadan drummer who was roaming the streets pounding his drum and hollering at the top of his lungs Since Ramadan began several days ago all over Istanbul similar drummers have been setting out into the streets some as early as am A tradition originating from a time when clocks were less prevalent their aim is to rustle the believers up out of bed in time for them to have a meal before the sun comes up Ramadan is by far the most important religious observance of the year for Muslims Somewhat like the Jewish celebration of Yom Kippur which some say influenced it Ramadan is a period of atonement and forgiveness Total remission of sins can be achieved if one fasts with pure intentions I have been told that in Turkey which is Muslim well over of all the Turks fast during Ramadan That estimate is certainly consistent with what I have seen and heard The majority of the Turks I come in contact tell me they fast The streets of Istanbul are normally full of vendors selling all sorts of food There are noticeably fewer of them now and they are significantly less busy During the day some restaurants are closed many of the rest all but empty I myself have been careful to be respectful and eat only indoors avoiding among other things my usual practice of grabbing a simit a bagel like round of bread and piece of fruit in the morning and eating them on my way to work Ismail leans over and asks if the service is similar to ones in the States I whisper back that I was raised Protestant and had not seen enough Catholic services in my life to say Raised Protestant was really much too strong a word to use My early religious education involved little more than an hour each Sunday down in the basement of the local Presbyterian Church first in Westfield New Jersey later in Aurora Illinois with my twin sister Sue There during our Sunday school class we often struggle for the entire hour to suppress giggling fits to which we only seemed susceptible in church Sitting now in St Antoines I check myself to see if any of those fits still linger am relieved to discover that none do The priest has returned and is now saying something about light being shown into the darkness and about how the darkness was unable to defeat that light The image of a light tiny but robust surrounded by infinite darkness is a particularly powerful one for me today especially given that I am so far from what I am most familiar A new voice the priest had been replaced again asks us to rise The words of Come Let Us Adore Him are projected onto the screen I lean over toward Ismail whisper that this is a very famous song He kids under his breath that perhaps its one of Gods greatest hits I smile straighten back up listen to the song begin There is no choir only a single guitar for accompaniment It takes a while for the congregations singing to build up Though it never becomes particularly loud it is beautiful Eventually I join in too As if something ethereal our voices drift up through the tremendous space that envelops us seeming only to just barely penetrate the thick cold air I am moved by how wonderful our singing sounds and am surprised to feel a tear though already icecold in the corner of my eye Most of the people here are Westerners I suppose and I wonder how many came like me to be reminded of home a few cold foreigners dwarfed by a Cathedral that is itself dwarfed by the immense Moslem city surrounding it For the first time since arriving in Istanbul I feel a bit homesick The song ends The priest returns invites everyone up to take communion Thinking that Ismail might find it interesting I suggest that we walk to the front of the church to watch We do But when we get there I am surprised that our way is blocked by a dozen or so television cameramen who have begun filming the ceremony I had not seen them before and wonder where they might have been hiding Some now with the powerful lights attached to their cameras turned on swing around and start filming those who have remained in the pews An older woman who is kneeling and praying is caught in one of those lights The cameraman moves in closer and is soon no more than a couple feet away With her eyes closed the elderly woman continues her praying I wonder how she can concentrate and indeed if she can But she continues or at least pretends to perhaps seeing it as an act of defiance The cameramen get even bolder and are now moving freely about the church filming others at point blank range Ismail says he does not want to be on the evening news and tells me he will meet me outside I return to my seat and watch the end of communion wrapped up like it is so incongruously in the hectic filming And I wonder how God would view all this his two most successful religions bumping up against each other in such an awkward fashion Which of the many ways these two religions have come up with to worship him would he approve of disapprove This afternoon in Istanbul the few Christians families that live here will be feasting and celebrating with their families and friends perhaps exchanging gifts Early in the evening after the blast of the cannon shots heard all over Istanbul that signal the end of the days Ramadan fasting pious Muslims will sit down to their own postfast celebratory meal the Iftar Later still the mosques will be filled though mostly by men where special Ramadan prayers will be said Istanbul itself is remarkable at least to westerners for the many domes of its huge Ottoman mosques and the hundreds of minarets that spike its skyline as well as the calls to prayer that pierce its urban din five times each day Yet when the day ends throughout Istanbul each of us will fall asleep under the same black sky In him was life and the life was the light of men And the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not Translation from the Bible Praise be to God Lord of the worlds The compassionate the merciful King on the day of reckoning Thee only do we worship and to Thee do we cry for help Guide Thou us on the straight path The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious with whom Thou are not angry and who go not astray

to autobiography Some of the original atmospherics have lingered and dont necessarily reflect anything about yours truly Later At The Galata Tower Cafe Cigarette smoke ignoring the lazy sweep of an old ceiling fan hangs in the air above me It seems to mock my obsessive rambling thoughts about teaching and writing and learning Turkish and of course HER Take it easy it says with a smirk Relax A phony look of concern clouds it further What about taking a deep breath Surreptitiously I think I take in the recommended breath but the smoke has drifted in closer notices There Isnt that better No I say to myself Dont worry I am not so far gone as to take this internal dialogue thing outside I flick my hand through one particularly annoying cloud of the stuff Now get lost Outside at the base of the ancient Galata Tower kids on their way home from school set off an M I flinch at the explosion which is amplified by the tight dimensions of the square and the old stone walls surrounding it The square itself left in a premature dusk by the huge towers shadow is temporarily emptied of the teenaged mob I stare out the window into the gloom Though only the bottom few meters yards of the tower are visible to me I am aware of its tremendous bulk The tower first built by the Genoese in the s dominates my entire neighborhood the Kuledibi It should remind us all I suppose of the durability of stone and dirt and of the significantly less impressive characteristics of flesh and blood Day and night amused perhaps by the slim activity of this generations version of flesh and blood it stands obdurate unmoved like the leg of a giant one dare not disturb Emboldened by the lack of any official response to the bombing onebyone the would be terrorists or freedom fighters whos to say drift back into the square I suspect the tower isnt nearly half as bothered by these kids budding pyromania as me since it has no doubt been subject to much more serious attacks during its or so year history Seeing that no adult has stormed into the square to reestablish order I brace myself for another blast Maybe Im the only one who really minds Every male in this country does have to serve in the army for eighteen months Perhaps the noise doesnt bother them or maybe they see that this rather serious version of childs play has a practical side to it giving the kids a head start on basic training I am surprised to discover that the waiter Yusuf is standing next to me He has his head thrown back slightly a gesture that has become for my benefit his version of the question More tea He has given up on words as the ones he knows still dont much match the ones I know Evet cay lutfen Bir az sutlu lutfen Yes tea please With a little milk please Never would have guessed that huh And yes I agree and have been told before too many lutfens There are probably other mistakes too but my words seem to get the job done Ill work on perfecting them sonra later Yusuf nods walks away I realize I have my head bent forward a subconscious adjustment I must have made to dodge some of the smoke I see a cat under one of the tables looking up at me It opens its mouth for what I figure is the beginning of a yawn But instead it emits a strange highpitched wail sounding more like a bird than a cat Embarrassed for the poor thing I look away For maybe the first time since I have been coming to this cafe I take a close look around I must be getting more comfortable Dikkat Watch out There are very few other people in the cafe which is surprising given the amount of smoke They are all sitting alone their heads like mine bent forward I suspect that boredom however and not the smoke is the proximate cause Every table is covered with green felt table clothes all of which are seriously spotted with tea stains and cigarette burns In the middle of each table looking like a tiny shrunken crown is a silver ashtray Above the kitchen which is squeezed unnecessarily tight into a corner of the otherwise spacious caf hangs a huge painting of a beach scene from somewhere in the Pacific Once no doubt bright and evocative it has aged and has now almost completely blended into and disappeared amongst the dull wood panels covering the top half of the room The green of the palm trees lining the beach is now so dark it is approaching black The sand probably once pure white is the color of the mud in the streets outside and the sea close to the color of the tea served here There are several boats pictured all pulled up onto the sand but they are now no more than ghosts and indeed look as if someone may have tried to erase them The painting is as changed and distorted as the dreams of those who sit below it absentmindedly stirring their tea their feet crammed into shoes stiff from having walked through too much winter rain their fingernails having long ago surrendered to the dirt now permanently built up under them wearing clothes that didnt smell so bad this morning they couldnt be worn just one more day drinking the cheap tea they can scarcely afford dreaming perhaps of little more than an early spring I sit up in my chair let my head fall back take in a deep breath and surprisingly

Republic of Northern Cyprus Attached to the rusting chainlink fence I am approaching are several blood red signs on which are stenciled both the black silhouette of the top half of a faceless soldier holding a rifle and a warning in Turkish that Fotograf Cekmek Yasaktir To Take Photographs Is Forbidden The fence no longer quite plumb in the soft sand seems to stumble across the beach eventually ending at a gently lapping Mediterranean There a tangle of wires attached to the fence extends a short way into the surf making anyones effort to outflank it obviously intentional The Turkish soldiers patrolling the nonmans land beyond to the south could thus treat such an intruder I suppose in whatever way they might see fit In the other direction the fence before it has completely left the beach cuts sharply north running in front of the hulks of four empty resort hotels Above them in the deep blue of the predusk sky hangs a crescent moon the same phased moon that graces the flags of both Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus One of the hotels still has the remnants of an identifying sign with just two of its six letter Greek name remaining Another hotel the smallest and no doubt at one time the quaintest has slatted wooden shutters covering the windows and doors leading out to tiny porches Some of the shutters have rusted off their hinges then fallen forward against the porch railings and now point out to sea as if giving urgent warning Others hang limply defeated from a single remaining hinge Most surprisingly every one of the windows I can see in the hotels is either missing or broken I am taken back by such thoroughness given that the most likely motivation was vindictiveness I struggle to find a loftie r one wondering if there was perhaps some valid security consideration such as making these somewhat strategically set buildings unattractive to squatters Maybe though I find this thought the most troubling it ha d been done just for the fun of it The fence I am walking along marks the border between inhabited and uninhabited Maras the Turkish Cypriots name for the town Greek Cypriots call Varosha The uninhabited part has been off limits since the Turkish army invaded Cyprus in Before that invasion the small Turkish Cyprio t minority had lived uneasily amongst the Greek Cypriot majority though in the years since when Cyprus was given its independence by the English periodic outbreaks of intercommunal violence had led to increased segregation and emigration The invasion launched after a coup on the island and another particularly vicious spat of violence eventually put an end to even this limited association as it did the worst of the violence The Turkish army went on to occupy roughly the northern most of the island which was accompanied and followed by one of the last centurys all too familiar mass crossmigrations The northern half is now home to nearly all of the islands Turkish Cypriots close to of the total population The border between the north and south known as the Atilla Line is one of the many UN patrolled blue lines in the world Maras actually falls within Northern Cyprus with the Attila Line further to the south It is controlled now by the Turkish army At the time of the invasion the town had been a thriving up and coming resort town run mostly by Greek Cypriots Indeed all over Cyprus since its independence despite the periodic deadly violence tourism had been booming But here in Maras at least the boom is no more The forty or so thousand Greek Cypriots who once owned ran or otherwise worked there fled in panic before the advancing Turkish army reportedly leaving behind uncleared breakfast dishe s on tables and washing on lines some forgetting to turn off lights that burned on and on for years UN sponsored proximity talks between the North and the South called proximity talks because the negotiating leaders will not met face to face started in New York on December th They are set to continue in Geneva this January st The return of Maras to its former mostly Greek Cypriot owners or more precisely their return to it is no doubt high on this meetings thus far secret agenda as it has been over the years at the many similar though always fruitless negotiations This time around however expectations are running higher than usual primarily because of a positive change in the dynamic between the two sides by far most important sponsor states Turkey and Greece Turkey for example has recently acquired candidacy status within the European Union which commits it to resolving among other things its disputes with EU member Greece Greece o n the other hand has lately suffered a series of embarrassments on the international stage the biggest of which was being caught last February having given sanctuary to fugitive Kurdish separatist leader and terrorist in most peoples minds Abdullah Apo Ocalan Coupled with th e significant good will garnered in the wake of the tremendous assistance Turkey and Greece gave each other after their twin earthquake disasters las t year the two countries just may be willing to push their client states toward a deal The point where the fence meets the sea marks the end of the gentle curve o f the short beach I am walking Behind me at this beachs other end is inhabited Maras nicest hotel oddly sporting an English name the Palm Beach Hotel If you looked in that direction taking in only the fine hotel the attractive beach the dark blue sea you might think you were in a tourist paradise But this is no paradise As I walk the last few feet to the fence I begin to see another beach emerge much longer than the one I am on sweeping south most of the way to the horizon There are more hotels which I knew from what I had read were also empty But my reading has not prepared me for the monstrous proportions of it all First in the distance one two three empty hotels quickly come into view then more slowly dozens more At the fence with the entire beach now visible I count more than thirty of them and these just on the waterfront Just beyond the fence are a few pieces of ancient playground equipment scattered about the sand I try to imagine the happy cries of the children as their parents more than twenty five years before pushed them round an d round in dizzying circles on the miniature merrygoaround now rusted and partially buried by drifted sand There is a long slide too though halftumbled down one of its rusted supports having twisted and collapsed after so many years of weather and neglect My own memories of childhood end at no such place now trapped inside a militarized nomans land How different life must seem to those whose memories do What sorts of dreams are built on this type of innocence lost I turn around and walk to the Palm Beach Hotel along the way wondering if it was merely luck that had left it on the business side of the fence On its porch I chose a chair since it has become cold near a partly cracked door through which comes a warm draft I order a cup of tea As the evening grows darker so does the abandoned town spread out before me The crescent moon is now higher in the sky and together with a strategically placed star provides a tiny bright exclamation point over the entire disma l scene below At that moment two energetic young men burst through the door The bigger of the two is gripping the arm of the other directing him forward to the porchs railing Bak look he says in Turkish gesturing out toward the sea with a broad sweep of his free arm Harika degil mi Wonderful isnt it Evet cok guzel Yes very beautiful his friend agrees They stand gazing out over the sea though after a brief moment I see the smaller mans head turn toward the darkened hulks that line the shore The bigger man glances at his friend sees where he is looking then looks himself They are both silent for quite some time before the bigger man returns his attention to his friend squeezes his arm His friend as if awakening from a trance slowly pulls his gaze from the ruins smiles up at his companion After two identical simultaneous shrugs they chuckle uneasily shaking their heads as they do When they turn to return to the door I holler out to them Baris mumkun m u Is peace possible They stop look at me with frowns of curiosity Nerelisiniz Where are yo u from It is the big one who had taken the lead Amerikaliyim Im an American His frown deepens though now for a different reason Belki dort bes yil sonra Maybe four five years from now belki hic bir zaman yok maybe never Ama ne hakkinda otuz bir ocak bir yeni baris gurusmesi But what about January st the new peace negotiations Hah he exclaims interrupting me Her zamen yeni baris gorumesi var There are always new peace negotiations He thereupon dismisses my inference with the same sweeping arm gesture he used to introduce to his friend the sea Get Your Private Free Email at
