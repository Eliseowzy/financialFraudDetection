Roatan one of the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras If you fly on Taca from San Francisco i dont think you have to go through San Salvador on the way home I would recommend flying Taca because United is a pain in the ass because the flight from San Salvador leaves at am but you cant take an early morning flight off Roatan so you have to leave the afternoon before and spend the night in San Salvador about miles from the airport You want to dive at Pura Vida Ask for Mel shes awesome You can stay at Pura Vida Hotel thats where steph stayed which is literally feet from the dive shop wwwpuravidaresortcom if i was you thats where id stay as its super convenient adjacent to dive shop boulangarie and the yummiest restaurants they also have a driver to take you to and from airport

Honduras in the western Caribbean Sea The largest of the Bay Islands Roatan measures approximately miles long and miles wide A mountainous ridge runs along the center of the island creating scenic hiking through tropical trees pockets of rainforest vines and flowers to dramatic vistas overlooking the ocean and reef Along the coast are diverse ecosystems from intricate mangroves and dramatic iron shore coastline to beautiful sandy beaches and inlets And of course just a short distance from shore is the barrier reef that has made Roatan famous for spectacular diving The average temperature in Roatan is a balmy F The trade winds provide a constant gentle breeze The Islanders speak both English and Spanish and welcome the tourist trade The island has a modern airport phones faxes paved road and electricity however Roatan is still laidback Everyone operates on island time which allows for conversation a second cup of hot Honduran coffee and a chance to enjoy the peaceful surroundings There are no shopping malls or fancy nightclubs This is the place for quiet mornings on the dock with a freshpicked mango hammock time with the sunset and a tropical drink fun nights at the local

attached document Original Message From Cameron Sellers mailto Sent Wednesday October PM To Jeff NRONcom Cc Subject RE honduras Thank you for your prompt reply I have taken the time to listen to all of your concerns and have responded below appropriately Question my need would more appropriately be characterized as a desire something that according to my buddhism class yesterday would be beneficial to give up if I want to achieve true happiness The desire however is related to the possibility of spending a fair amount of time in diving locations during my honeymoon Due to the limited amount of vacation time I am alotted from my employer I am going to find it necessary to forego all vacation opportunities for the next months other than this week between Christmas and New Years and hence find it necessary to use the specified time to obtain the coveted certification No I am not interested in getting certified in Monterey Bay Question As far as I know the weather is quite pleasant year round I know the place we intend to go is on an island off the eastern coast of Honduras I hope to provide you with a more deailed answer after consulting reliable travel guides and weather almanacs Question The diving is supposed to be quite killer as you put it I have a direct recommendation from my travel obsessed friend jessica who just got certified there a couple months ago and has provided me with both information and endorsements Yes Belizeis supposed to be very good also but the island we would be going to is practcally in Belize Please refer to a map of Honduras

Jeff NRONcom To Cameron Sellers PP Sent Wed Oct Subject RE honduras Interesting Question Please explain the following line from your note I really need to get certified for diving Question How hot is it down there Question Cheap is good but if youre going to travel that far to dive is the diving good there or is there another place like Beliz where the diving is supposed to be killer Original Message From Cameron Sellers mailto Sent Wednesday October PM To Dasovich Jeff PP Subject honduras I asked PP if she was interested in going to Honduras between xmas and new years this year I really need to get certified for diving and the diving there is extremely cheap but reliable its an American outfit and all PADI PP thought she might be interested in going and doing it with me So first I wanted to know what you thought of the whole thing Then if you are into it at all I will look into flight opportunities staying down there and the scuba course and single dives are all very cheap but the flight would be the most expensive And last do you have miles on continental and are they miles that PP can take advantage of also I think Continental goes to San Salvador which is a common connecting city So you might luck out on flight costs and the whole trip would not be too bad What do you think Cameron Sellers Vice President Business Development PERFECT Embarcadero Road Suite Palo

Grant Jessica mailto Sent Wednesday October PM To Cameron Sellers Subject RE honduras questions hi depends on which airline you fly i flew United to San Salvador El Salvador then on Taca Airlines over to Roatan one of the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras If you fly on Taca from San Francisco i dont think you have to go through San Salvador on the way home I would recommend flying Taca because United is a pain in the ass because the flight from San Salvador leaves at am but you cant take an early morning flight off Roatan so you have to leave the afternoon before and spend the night in San Salvador about miles from the airport You want to dive at Pura Vida Ask for Mel shes awesome You can stay at Pura Vida Hotel thats where steph stayed which is literally feet from the dive shop wwwpuravidaresortcom if i was you thats where id stay as its super convenient adjacent to dive shop boulangarie and the yummiest restaurants they also have a driver to take you to and from airport which is quite a help your open water PADI course should be i dont think im going there next month as its too hectic to try and fly all the way there and back in days id need at least or i miss you

considering BayBuilder They said they dont care about the DealBench platform it doesnt meet their needs and DealBench isnt giving any better deal to Enrons business units than they would to anyone
