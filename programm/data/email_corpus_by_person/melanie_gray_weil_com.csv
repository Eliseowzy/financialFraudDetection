Vanderhorst Barry Subject Nation Fuel Gas Supply Corporation ENA EES Motions We just found out that National Fuel Gas Supply NFGS filed motions with the bankruptcy court on December to vacate the automatic stay and allow NFGS to terminate the firm and interruptible transport agreements compel the Debtor to assume or reject the agreements or provide adequate assurance of future performance by the Debtor A separate motion for ENA and EES was filed The hearing looks like it was scheduled on January I do not believe that ENAs and EESs commercial groups were aware that these NFGSs motions had been made to the court Was Legal involved in a response to these motions If ENA and EES did not respond at the court hearing is the decision of the court to terminate the agreements Most of the agreements were for interruptible services that had no future value to the Estate One of the two firm ENA agreements was tied to a producer netback transaction that Enron Canada is working on a settlement with the producer The other firm ENA agreement is outofthemoney and would have been rejected anyway Please confirm that by ENA and EES taking no action at the hearing that the agreements have been terminated I will get with Enron Canada so that fact can be included in their settlement with the producer Thanks for your help Ruth Concannon This email is the property of Enron Corp andor

<7713342.1075853204178.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,melanie.gray@weil.com,2001-01-30 06:22:00,RE Could this be Trust counsels argument Cc another email about theTrusts damage theories about which I wrote in an earlier email YOu may want to print this out until you get through the emails Im forwarding to you about this subject Thanks Forwarded by Melanie GrayHOWGMUS on PM Greenswag Douglas on AM cc Beth Nelson Catherine HortonMorin Catherine McEnroe Dan Oberdorfer Eric A Henzy Esq Email James Bertrand Noah Hall Subject RE Could this be Trust counsels argument Leonard Street and Deinard Joint Defense Group Privileged Communication January Re Trusts Damage Theory Dear Counsel I think Tim is correct when he lays out the Trusts damage theory While we should anticipate it and have a response in our brief I suggest there are a number of flaws The damage language for Seller nondelivery expressly provides that no damages are allowed where the nondelivery was caused by the buyer Cause is an undefined term as far as I can see We will of course argue that cause necessarily includes PCAs prospective inability to perform and its actual business failure If cause were limited to situations where the buyer affirmatively refuses to take the power then a dying marketer could make millions simply by keeping its mouth shut The logical extension of the Trusts argument that you have to run through the two step damage analysis regardless of the reasons for one partys failure to perform is that as noted above a shaky marketer could time its failure in a rising market and thus assert millions in damage claims by never telling counterparties it would not accept delivery of power The Trusts argument presupposes that we had no legal right to demand adequate assurance and take steps to protect ourselves The reference to the exclusive nature of the damage remedy has nothing to do with our right to demand adequate assurance Rather that remedy provision expresses the exclusive means

Communication Group Paul Turner and I were discussing the following interpretation of the liquidated damages clause in PCAs confirmations which we believe is likely going to be Trust counsels argument in the mediation The language of the liquidated damages provision LD Provision which I have simplified is as follows Damages for NonPerformance For this firm transaction if the Buyer fails to schedule andor to receive the Quantity where such failure was not excused by Seller Buyer shall pay Seller on the date payment would otherwise be due under this transaction an amount for each MWh of such deficiency equaling the sum of i the contract price minus ii the market price provided however if the amount determined in the preceding clause is negative then the amount shall be equal to zero for purposes of calculating the deficiency payment For this firm transaction if the Seller fails to schedule andor to deliver the Quantity where such failure was not excused by Buyer Seller shall pay Buyer on the date payment would otherwise be due under this transaction an amount for each MWh of such deficiency equaling the sum of i the market price minus ii the contract price provided however if the amount determined in the preceding clause is negative then the amount shall be equal to zero for purposes of calculating the deficiency payment acknowledgement that these provisions are for liquidated damages and not a penalty exclusive remedy provision To illustrate how I think that the Trust interprets this LD Provision lets assume that PGET had a contract to sell power to PCA for delivery at Cinergy during JulyAugust at a price of MWH the Transaction Lets assume that based on PCAs payment or delivery defaults PGET terminates the Transaction and all other forward transactions with PCA in late June Lets assume further that the market price for power at Cinergy was MWH on the date of termination without getting into whether you look to index price of forward price The Trust will argue that PCA failed to schedule andor receive power from PGET under the Transaction and therefore PCA must make the deficiency payment to PGET under clause Under clause however this deficiency payment would be zero The Trust will argue further that PGET also failed to schedule andor deliver power to PCA under the Transaction and therefore PGET must make the deficiency payment to PCA under clause Under clause PGET would have to make a deficiency payment of times the Quantity The Trust will argue further that under the express contractual language of the LD Provision it doesnt matter whether PCA was able to actually perform under the Transaction The parties intent in entering into an agreement containing the LD Provision was to require each party to pay the deficiency amount in the event that the Transaction is not performed The only situation where a party would NOT have to pay the deficiency amount is a in the event of force majeure or b when the other party excuses performance PCA will argue that regardless of whether it was in default or unable to perform it did not excuse performance by PGET under the Transaction The Trust will argue that this is the parties express contract and sole remedy in the event of nonperformance Therefore the Trust will argue it does not matter whether PCA was able to perform the contracts If a contract was not performed then the damages are calculated under the LD Provision The Trust will also argue that it does not matter whether PGET had a RIGHT to terminate the Transaction because of PCAs default It only matters that the contract was not performed Moreover I am confident that this interpretation of the LD provision is the basis for the positive difference damages calculation that Peter keeps referring to With regard to damages I imagine that the Trust will argue that A Under direct bookouts performance is excused therefore you net the contract price of the two contracts B Under all other transactions you look solely at whether power was scheduled andor delivered If not then you calculate each partys liquidated damages with respect to each and every transaction under clauses and of the LD Provision The advantage this line of argument is obvious It is based on the express language of the confirmation statement that the Trust will contend was part of the contract It is a simple response to the inability to perform argument and It actually makes sense in the context of a commodities market This is what we are going to hear from the Trust in their mediation submission Baird Tim Billeck Jason

<6300929.1075853182127.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,melanie.gray@weil.com,2000-09-08 08:34:00,PCA Bankruptcy Court Status Hearing on September email updates you on the joint defense conference call and the issues related to the September th hearing It is long so you may want to print it out and read a hard copy Your suggestion of following the joint defense discussion of what theyll discuss with the court on September th was a good one Although I think the general direction of the joint defense group is sound it may be in EPMIs best interest to have counsel there even if it is local counsel so that we can avoid travel expenses at this point Consistent with what the Bankruptcy Court has stated on the record and based upon more recent conversations with his former law clerk the Judge would like to resolve at the hearing whether the parties are willing to go to mediation and whether there is agreement to appoint a special discovery master to handle the myriad of discovery disputes that have already arisen and that are certain to multiply as the cases move forward From listening to the defense counsel who have appeared before the judge in this case it is clear that this judge does not want to decide anything is loath to try these cases and promises to give only day a month for any trial let alone the trials that would be necessary to hear these cases if they dont settle The judge will not consider summary judgments and he is held in low regard by the defense group The big players on the joint defense team very much want the equivalent of a special discovery master but they want the powers defined more broadly so that the master can make recommendations to the judge of how to try these cases if they go to trial eg bifurcation of factual and legal issues to resolve before full trial on the merits order in which the cases will go to trial etc The recommendation of the rest of the joint defense group is to ask that a special pretrial master be appointed to resolve discovery disputes and make recommendations to the bankruptcy judge for further proceedings including trial Each defendant would be able to go to mediation whenever it feels it has enough discovery but the majority of the defense group did not want to ask for the appointment of a settlement mediator at this time Although there was not complete consensus the majority view was to propose that the costs of the special master be split evenly among all the parties There are approximately adversaries on file and counsel representing more than one defendant were already arguing that they should only be treated as only one party given how closely aligned their defenses and interests are Further although most of the defense group feels that the trust should be required to pay its share as party many are willing to withdraw that requirement and let the trust get a free ride if the trustee objects to the proposal thereby isolating the trustee and making him look foolish I raise this in detail because of my concern that EPMI with much cleaner and stronger defenses may end carrying more of the expense freight than it should Given that everyone envisions that this pretrial mediator will have his or her hands full the expense of even of that could add up quickly My suggestion is that the plaintiff or particular defendant who files the discovery dispute pays for the time the pretrial master spends resolving it For matters involving all defendants then the costs be split evenly My further suggestion echoing what yall said on our last conference call is to try to position this case for settlement as soon as possible so that the expenses do not mount by virtue of the morass of the rest of the litigation against defendants who did not terminate their contracts The next issue is whether to attend the hearing on the th The order setting the hearing was finally entered on September th Elizabeth Austin recommended local counsel see previous emails was kind enough to send me a copy The Order requires that the hearing be attended by all counsel for all Defendants in the pending adversary proceedings Counsel are further required to have full authorization to resolve any issue arising at the status conference and shall be either accompanied by the person or persons authorized and competent to accept or reject the resolution of such issues or such persons shall be available by telephone Further the docket reflects that a pretrial order is due in our case by September This is an special animal of the local rules and is not the typical pretrial order It only requires that parties states whether they agree that the case is a core or noncore proceeding set forth the answer or response date and set forth the proposed length for discovery The plaintiff is responsible for contacting the defendant to reach agreement on the pretrial order To date I assume that youve received no calls or correspondence from Kaye Scholer about this In another adversary filed against El Paso about the same time that the case against Enron was filed the trustee has already unilaterally filed a motion to extend the deadline for filing the pretrial Ill check the docket again on Monday to see if such an extension motion was filed in our adversary If we are contacted by the trustee counsel between now and the th it will take all of about minutes to prepare the pretrial order Again this is a long way of saying that although we are not obligated to do anything about the pretrial order especially since we havent yet received a copy of the complaint we do have actual knowledge of the proceedings we have joined the defense group and we may get off to a bad start if we dont attend the hearing and then try to argue that we dont want some part of the order entered to apply to us If I were the judge my first question would be why werent you here on the th so that you could have objected then To respond that we didnt think we had to because we had not yet received a copy of the complaint in the mail may not endear us to the judge if he presses us to find out what we actually knew about the hearing My recommendation is that either local counsel or I attend the hearing even though Id love to avoid the cost altogether There is a joint defense meeting the night before and the morning of the status hearing where the group is going to further attempt to reach agreement among themselves as to how theyre going to propose to handle discovery and legal issues assuming that a pretrial master is appointed If you decide that I dont need to go I would recommend that our local counsel attend if we have retained him or her by then If it is Elizabeth Austin I have confidence that she will adequately protect Enrons interests especially given her prior involvement in the case If counsel for EPMI attends the hearing then you Elizabeth or Jeff should be reachable by phone in case something comes up that we need authorization for We have another joint defense conference call set up for Wednesday Sept at pm By that time a draft of the proposed order for the pretrial master will be circulated with the proposed sharing of costs provisions If we are going to object to an equal sharing for all work performed by the pretrial master I should advise the group on Wednesday in this call If we arent able to get this case settled relatively quickly there will be a great deal of benefit by being a member of the joint defense group especially with regard to establishing other grounds for termination of the transactions and fighting the trustees damage calculations In determining the appropriate settlement amount reduction of EPMIs proof of claim we should be cognizant that the costs of the defense may be higher than it would otherwise be if this were the only pending litigation involving this kind of claim I look forward to your response I will be in town all of next week so call at your convenience NOTE The information contained in this

<10192769.1075853191519.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,melanie.gray@weil.com,2000-11-07 02:59:00,Settlement Call and Analysis of Termination Notice Issueis a long email you may want to print out to read Settlement Conference Call Issues We are set for the conference call tomorrow morning Ill come to your offices Have Leslie and Tom had any discussions about the calculation of the proof of claim I assume not given that they want EPMI to sign the confidentiality agreement that I faxed to you yesterday The confidentiality agreement essentially says that well treat any communications and documents shared in the settlement discussions as confidential The only problem I have with the scope is that for the pure factual exchange about how they are calculating our proof of claim the unpaid electricity sold in May June and July that is not confidential or proprietary information and we shouldnt have to go take discovery to prove it up if we arent able to reach a settlement However that discovery should not be burdensome and I doubt that the Trustee will agree to go forward with the settlement conference unless we sign the agreement Action Required I would appreciate it if you would look at the agreement and let me know whether youre willing to sign it If so please execute it and fax it to me so that I can get it to the Trustee before the call tomorrow so that we dont waste any time If you dont want to enter into it then please let me know so that I can let them know and determine whether there is anything we can discuss with the trust tomorrow Could you please let me know what phone number that I should give the Trustee and counsel for them to call us tomorrow at am If youd prefer that we place the call let me know and Ill get the phone number but I suggest that the cost of the call be on their ticket Termination Notice Issues We have taken a look at the law in Texas in connection with their anticipated allegation that we did not provide notice consistent with the terms of the Master Agreement they did not receive the June letter and consequently we did not properly terminate the transactions under the Master Agreement and are not entitled to use the termination payment provisions of the Master Agreement The bottom line is that if we can prove actual receipt then sending it to the wrong address will not negate the effectiveness of the notice Texas Utilities Electric Co v Aetna Casualty Surety Co SWd Tex App Dallas The standard used in most cases is substantial compliance rather than strict compliance An address that is correct in all respects except that it is not the address in the notice section of the contract can fully perform the function of the specified address absent the special circumstance that a particular separate address for distinct purpose is brought to the attention of the contracting party Ray v Metropolitan Life Ins Co F Supp SD Tex I assume that there was no discussion about the address given in the Master Agreement and no discussion about the importance of using that address for the June nonpayment notice Section of the Master Agreement states that Notice by facsimile shall be deemed to have been received by the close of the Business Day on which it was transmitted Thus by the terms of the Master Agreement itself EPMIs transmission confirmation should be sufficient to prove that it was transmitted and received If PCA disputes receipt we have the burden to prove receipt Although a notice provision that allows delivery by mail of fax shifts the risk of nondelivery of the notice from the sender to the intended receiver if the sending party fails to use the address specified in the contract the risk of nondelivery shifts back to the sender See eg University Emergency Medicine Foundation v Rapier Investments Ltd Fd st Cir In terms of what evidence we can present to prove that the fax was sent and actually received obviously the fax and confirmation sheet are the most important pieces of evidence we have In addition we would want to have testimony from the author James Fallon andor Jeff Hodge and the person who actually faxed it Jeffs secretary who made the hand written notation on the fax cover sheet In Ray Judge Hughes stated the evidence showed that it the letter was prepared and processed as were all of the other letters sent to Energy Resources The likelihood that the letter was not received is remote especially since all the other correspondence was received F Supp at Proof that all the other confirmation notices were received at the CT address and acted upon by PCA will help us carry the burden of proof on actual receipt Our waiver or modification argument based upon course of dealing is not as strong as I had hoped The Master Agreement provides in section that no modification to this Master Agreement shall be enforceable unless reduced to writing and executed by the Parties Courts have upheld these nonmodification provisions See eg Brookside Farms v Mama Rizzos Inc F Supp SD Tex In Brookside the court articulated the black letter law just described but then found that the nonwaiver clause did not protect the party asserting it because of certain equitable factors If the PCA New York office was closed or defunct at the time the June th letter was sent we could rely on that to try to escape the nonwaiver clause ruling in Brookside Motion to Compel Arbitration A quick and interesting update As you recall the Trustee has asked for an extension of the briefing schedule to allow them to determine whether we will settle the case Richard was agreeable to a short extension When I communicated this back Jane Parver indicated that the Trustee would want discovery of the intent of the parties in connection with the arbitration clause From previous conversations with Elizabeth my sense is that the intent evidence is nonexistent because it was not negotiated or the evidence will not necessarily help us because at the time the Master Agreement was entered into EPMI wanted a more limited arbitration clause If I understand correctly similar agreements now have broader language to require arbitration or any and all disputes Please let me know if Im incorrect in my assumption I assume that we will go along with the short extension of two weeks but if Parver follows through on her statement shes going to want a deposition of someone knowledgeable of the intent of the arbitration clause I look forward to seeing you tomorrow Thanks NOTE The information contained in this email message is intended only for use of the

Nelson Catherine HortonMorin Catherine McEnroe Dan Oberdorfer Eric A Henzy Esq Email James Bertrand Noah Hall Subject RE Could this be Trust counsels argument Leonard Street and Deinard Joint Defense Group Privileged Communication January Re Trusts Damage Theory Dear Counsel I think Tim is correct when he lays out the Trusts damage theory While we should anticipate it and have a response in our brief I suggest there are a number of flaws The damage language for Seller nondelivery expressly provides that no damages are allowed where the nondelivery was caused by the buyer Cause is an undefined term as far as I can see We will of course argue that cause necessarily includes PCAs prospective inability to perform and its actual business failure If cause were limited to situations where the buyer affirmatively refuses to take the power then a dying marketer could make millions simply by keeping its mouth shut The logical extension of the Trusts argument that you have to run through the two step damage analysis regardless of the reasons for one partys failure to perform is that as noted above a shaky marketer could time its failure in a rising market and thus assert millions in damage claims by never telling counterparties it would not accept delivery of power The Trusts argument presupposes that we had no legal right to demand adequate assurance and take steps to protect ourselves The reference to the exclusive nature of the damage remedy has nothing to do with our right to demand adequate assurance Rather that remedy provision expresses the exclusive means for calculating the amount of damages in the event the seller breaches and does not address the question of whether in fact the seller actually breached the contract Regards Douglas B Greenswag Esq

Communication Group Paul Turner and I were discussing the following interpretation of the liquidated damages clause in PCAs confirmations which we believe is likely going to be Trust counsels argument in the mediation The language of the liquidated damages provision LD Provision which I have simplified is as follows Damages for NonPerformance For this firm transaction if the Buyer fails to schedule andor to receive the Quantity where such failure was not excused by Seller Buyer shall pay Seller on the date payment would otherwise be due under this transaction an amount for each MWh of such deficiency equaling the sum of i the contract price minus ii the market price provided however if the amount determined in the preceding clause is negative then the amount shall be equal to zero for purposes of calculating the deficiency payment For this firm transaction if the Seller fails to schedule andor to deliver the Quantity where such failure was not excused by Buyer Seller shall pay Buyer on the date payment would otherwise be due under this transaction an amount for each MWh of such deficiency equaling the sum of i the market price minus ii the contract price provided however if the amount determined in the preceding clause is negative then the amount shall be equal to zero for purposes of calculating the deficiency payment acknowledgement that these provisions are for liquidated damages and not a penalty exclusive remedy provision To illustrate how I think that the Trust interprets this LD Provision lets assume that PGET had a contract to sell power to PCA for delivery at Cinergy during JulyAugust at a price of MWH the Transaction Lets assume that based on PCAs payment or delivery defaults PGET terminates the Transaction and all other forward transactions with PCA in late June Lets assume further that the market price for power at Cinergy was MWH on the date of termination without getting into whether you look to index price of forward price The Trust will argue that PCA failed to schedule andor receive power from PGET under the Transaction and therefore PCA must make the deficiency payment to PGET under clause Under clause however this deficiency payment would be zero The Trust will argue further that PGET also failed to schedule andor deliver power to PCA under the Transaction and therefore PGET must make the deficiency payment to PCA under clause Under clause PGET would have to make a deficiency payment of times the Quantity The Trust will argue further that under the express contractual language of the LD Provision it doesnt matter whether PCA was able to actually perform under the Transaction The parties intent in entering into an agreement containing the LD Provision was to require each party to pay the deficiency amount in the event that the Transaction is not performed The only situation where a party would NOT have to pay the deficiency amount is a in the event of force majeure or b when the other party excuses performance PCA will argue that regardless of whether it was in default or unable to perform it did not excuse performance by PGET under the Transaction The Trust will argue that this is the parties express contract and sole remedy in the event of nonperformance Therefore the Trust will argue it does not matter whether PCA was able to perform the contracts If a contract was not performed then the damages are calculated under the LD Provision The Trust will also argue that it does not matter whether PGET had a RIGHT to terminate the Transaction because of PCAs default It only matters that the contract was not performed Moreover I am confident that this interpretation of the LD provision is the basis for the positive difference damages calculation that Peter keeps referring to With regard to damages I imagine that the Trust will argue that A Under direct bookouts performance is excused therefore you net the contract price of the two contracts B Under all other transactions you look solely at whether power was scheduled andor delivered If not then you calculate each partys liquidated damages with respect to each and every transaction under clauses and of the LD Provision The advantage this line of argument is obvious It is based on the express language of the confirmation statement that the Trust will contend was part of the contract It is a simple response to the inability to perform argument and It actually makes sense in the context of a commodities market This is what we are going to hear from the Trust in their mediation submission Baird Tim Billeck Jason

<32137923.1075853248063.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,melanie.gray@weil.com,2000-09-08 08:34:00,PCA Bankruptcy Court Status Hearing on September email updates you on the joint defense conference call and the issues related to the September th hearing It is long so you may want to print it out and read a hard copy Your suggestion of following the joint defense discussion of what theyll discuss with the court on September th was a good one Although I think the general direction of the joint defense group is sound it may be in EPMIs best interest to have counsel there even if it is local counsel so that we can avoid travel expenses at this point Consistent with what the Bankruptcy Court has stated on the record and based upon more recent conversations with his former law clerk the Judge would like to resolve at the hearing whether the parties are willing to go to mediation and whether there is agreement to appoint a special discovery master to handle the myriad of discovery disputes that have already arisen and that are certain to multiply as the cases move forward From listening to the defense counsel who have appeared before the judge in this case it is clear that this judge does not want to decide anything is loath to try these cases and promises to give only day a month for any trial let alone the trials that would be necessary to hear these cases if they dont settle The judge will not consider summary judgments and he is held in low regard by the defense group The big players on the joint defense team very much want the equivalent of a special discovery master but they want the powers defined more broadly so that the master can make recommendations to the judge of how to try these cases if they go to trial eg bifurcation of factual and legal issues to resolve before full trial on the merits order in which the cases will go to trial etc The recommendation of the rest of the joint defense group is to ask that a special pretrial master be appointed to resolve discovery disputes and make recommendations to the bankruptcy judge for further proceedings including trial Each defendant would be able to go to mediation whenever it feels it has enough discovery but the majority of the defense group did not want to ask for the appointment of a settlement mediator at this time Although there was not complete consensus the majority view was to propose that the costs of the special master be split evenly among all the parties There are approximately adversaries on file and counsel representing more than one defendant were already arguing that they should only be treated as only one party given how closely aligned their defenses and interests are Further although most of the defense group feels that the trust should be required to pay its share as party many are willing to withdraw that requirement and let the trust get a free ride if the trustee objects to the proposal thereby isolating the trustee and making him look foolish I raise this in detail because of my concern that EPMI with much cleaner and stronger defenses may end carrying more of the expense freight than it should Given that everyone envisions that this pretrial mediator will have his or her hands full the expense of even of that could add up quickly My suggestion is that the plaintiff or particular defendant who files the discovery dispute pays for the time the pretrial master spends resolving it For matters involving all defendants then the costs be split evenly My further suggestion echoing what yall said on our last conference call is to try to position this case for settlement as soon as possible so that the expenses do not mount by virtue of the morass of the rest of the litigation against defendants who did not terminate their contracts The next issue is whether to attend the hearing on the th The order setting the hearing was finally entered on September th Elizabeth Austin recommended local counsel see previous emails was kind enough to send me a copy The Order requires that the hearing be attended by all counsel for all Defendants in the pending adversary proceedings Counsel are further required to have full authorization to resolve any issue arising at the status conference and shall be either accompanied by the person or persons authorized and competent to accept or reject the resolution of such issues or such persons shall be available by telephone Further the docket reflects that a pretrial order is due in our case by September This is an special animal of the local rules and is not the typical pretrial order It only requires that parties states whether they agree that the case is a core or noncore proceeding set forth the answer or response date and set forth the proposed length for discovery The plaintiff is responsible for contacting the defendant to reach agreement on the pretrial order To date I assume that youve received no calls or correspondence from Kaye Scholer about this In another adversary filed against El Paso about the same time that the case against Enron was filed the trustee has already unilaterally filed a motion to extend the deadline for filing the pretrial Ill check the docket again on Monday to see if such an extension motion was filed in our adversary If we are contacted by the trustee counsel between now and the th it will take all of about minutes to prepare the pretrial order Again this is a long way of saying that although we are not obligated to do anything about the pretrial order especially since we havent yet received a copy of the complaint we do have actual knowledge of the proceedings we have joined the defense group and we may get off to a bad start if we dont attend the hearing and then try to argue that we dont want some part of the order entered to apply to us If I were the judge my first question would be why werent you here on the th so that you could have objected then To respond that we didnt think we had to because we had not yet received a copy of the complaint in the mail may not endear us to the judge if he presses us to find out what we actually knew about the hearing My recommendation is that either local counsel or I attend the hearing even though Id love to avoid the cost altogether There is a joint defense meeting the night before and the morning of the status hearing where the group is going to further attempt to reach agreement among themselves as to how theyre going to propose to handle discovery and legal issues assuming that a pretrial master is appointed If you decide that I dont need to go I would recommend that our local counsel attend if we have retained him or her by then If it is Elizabeth Austin I have confidence that she will adequately protect Enrons interests especially given her prior involvement in the case If counsel for EPMI attends the hearing then you Elizabeth or Jeff should be reachable by phone in case something comes up that we need authorization for We have another joint defense conference call set up for Wednesday Sept at pm By that time a draft of the proposed order for the pretrial master will be circulated with the proposed sharing of costs provisions If we are going to object to an equal sharing for all work performed by the pretrial master I should advise the group on Wednesday in this call If we arent able to get this case settled relatively quickly there will be a great deal of benefit by being a member of the joint defense group especially with regard to establishing other grounds for termination of the transactions and fighting the trustees damage calculations In determining the appropriate settlement amount reduction of EPMIs proof of claim we should be cognizant that the costs of the defense may be higher than it would otherwise be if this were the only pending litigation involving this kind of claim I look forward to your response I will be in town all of next week so call at your convenience NOTE The information contained in this

<10323982.1075853248158.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,melanie.gray@weil.com,2000-11-07 02:59:00,Settlement Call and Analysis of Termination Notice Issueis a long email you may want to print out to read Settlement Conference Call Issues We are set for the conference call tomorrow morning Ill come to your offices Have Leslie and Tom had any discussions about the calculation of the proof of claim I assume not given that they want EPMI to sign the confidentiality agreement that I faxed to you yesterday The confidentiality agreement essentially says that well treat any communications and documents shared in the settlement discussions as confidential The only problem I have with the scope is that for the pure factual exchange about how they are calculating our proof of claim the unpaid electricity sold in May June and July that is not confidential or proprietary information and we shouldnt have to go take discovery to prove it up if we arent able to reach a settlement However that discovery should not be burdensome and I doubt that the Trustee will agree to go forward with the settlement conference unless we sign the agreement Action Required I would appreciate it if you would look at the agreement and let me know whether youre willing to sign it If so please execute it and fax it to me so that I can get it to the Trustee before the call tomorrow so that we dont waste any time If you dont want to enter into it then please let me know so that I can let them know and determine whether there is anything we can discuss with the trust tomorrow Could you please let me know what phone number that I should give the Trustee and counsel for them to call us tomorrow at am If youd prefer that we place the call let me know and Ill get the phone number but I suggest that the cost of the call be on their ticket Termination Notice Issues We have taken a look at the law in Texas in connection with their anticipated allegation that we did not provide notice consistent with the terms of the Master Agreement they did not receive the June letter and consequently we did not properly terminate the transactions under the Master Agreement and are not entitled to use the termination payment provisions of the Master Agreement The bottom line is that if we can prove actual receipt then sending it to the wrong address will not negate the effectiveness of the notice Texas Utilities Electric Co v Aetna Casualty Surety Co SWd Tex App Dallas The standard used in most cases is substantial compliance rather than strict compliance An address that is correct in all respects except that it is not the address in the notice section of the contract can fully perform the function of the specified address absent the special circumstance that a particular separate address for distinct purpose is brought to the attention of the contracting party Ray v Metropolitan Life Ins Co F Supp SD Tex I assume that there was no discussion about the address given in the Master Agreement and no discussion about the importance of using that address for the June nonpayment notice Section of the Master Agreement states that Notice by facsimile shall be deemed to have been received by the close of the Business Day on which it was transmitted Thus by the terms of the Master Agreement itself EPMIs transmission confirmation should be sufficient to prove that it was transmitted and received If PCA disputes receipt we have the burden to prove receipt Although a notice provision that allows delivery by mail of fax shifts the risk of nondelivery of the notice from the sender to the intended receiver if the sending party fails to use the address specified in the contract the risk of nondelivery shifts back to the sender See eg University Emergency Medicine Foundation v Rapier Investments Ltd Fd st Cir In terms of what evidence we can present to prove that the fax was sent and actually received obviously the fax and confirmation sheet are the most important pieces of evidence we have In addition we would want to have testimony from the author James Fallon andor Jeff Hodge and the person who actually faxed it Jeffs secretary who made the hand written notation on the fax cover sheet In Ray Judge Hughes stated the evidence showed that it the letter was prepared and processed as were all of the other letters sent to Energy Resources The likelihood that the letter was not received is remote especially since all the other correspondence was received F Supp at Proof that all the other confirmation notices were received at the CT address and acted upon by PCA will help us carry the burden of proof on actual receipt Our waiver or modification argument based upon course of dealing is not as strong as I had hoped The Master Agreement provides in section that no modification to this Master Agreement shall be enforceable unless reduced to writing and executed by the Parties Courts have upheld these nonmodification provisions See eg Brookside Farms v Mama Rizzos Inc F Supp SD Tex In Brookside the court articulated the black letter law just described but then found that the nonwaiver clause did not protect the party asserting it because of certain equitable factors If the PCA New York office was closed or defunct at the time the June th letter was sent we could rely on that to try to escape the nonwaiver clause ruling in Brookside Motion to Compel Arbitration A quick and interesting update As you recall the Trustee has asked for an extension of the briefing schedule to allow them to determine whether we will settle the case Richard was agreeable to a short extension When I communicated this back Jane Parver indicated that the Trustee would want discovery of the intent of the parties in connection with the arbitration clause From previous conversations with Elizabeth my sense is that the intent evidence is nonexistent because it was not negotiated or the evidence will not necessarily help us because at the time the Master Agreement was entered into EPMI wanted a more limited arbitration clause If I understand correctly similar agreements now have broader language to require arbitration or any and all disputes Please let me know if Im incorrect in my assumption I assume that we will go along with the short extension of two weeks but if Parver follows through on her statement shes going to want a deposition of someone knowledgeable of the intent of the arbitration clause I look forward to seeing you tomorrow Thanks NOTE The information contained in this email message is intended only for use of the
