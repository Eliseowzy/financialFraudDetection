look good Ann is trying to get a meeting set up to di scuss our next step regarding settlement tentatively Greg Original Message From Passamonti Ida mailto Sent Wednesday October PM To Porter Gregory J Subject RE E TW settlement offer Sensitivity Confidential Yes the copies of the letter orders and one decision of the footnote arr ived yesterday and we have looked at them First I think it is in this proceeding that the FERC advisory staff raised the issue whether the contracts revealed contravention of FERC policy Se e the original order to show cause The issues addressed in the hearing we re a means or an attempt to get more facts that relate to the original ques tions flagged by the FERC advisory staff regarding the FERCs policy on use of negotiated rates We also know that when Indicated Shippers attempted to challenge the policy statement when it first issued the court said that such a challenge was not appropriate and only the implementation cases reg arding the policy would give rise to issues the court could consider The CPUC is therefore in the right forum and in the right proceeding to claim t hat TW used marketbased rates without authority to use marketbased rates TWs tariff must be modified to provide for the exclusion of marketbased rates Of course we understand that the FERC had pinned its hopes on neg otiated rates working equitably and legally by emphasizing all shippers mus t be treated in nondiscriminatory manner and all shippers who bid the recou rse rate must be granted the capacity bid on at the recourse rate We saw in this proceeding however that shippers were not treated equally and in nondiscriminatory manner see eg our discussion in CPUCs reply brief of TWs total disregard for accuracy and equitable treatment regarding announc ement of delivery points We also note that in your proposed tariff modification last page of tarif f changes attachment to your outline of settlement you do not provide for evaluation of bids in a manner that would indeed assure shippers who bid f or the capacity they want at the recourse rate would get that capacity at t he recourse rate If there are a number of bidders at the recourse rate and some bidders at a negotiated rate that is not fixed at a rate below the re course rate then the available capacity should first be prorated among the recourse rate bidders and the remainder allocated to negotiated rate bidd ers Unless this is done TW cannot say that shippers who bid the recourse rate are awarded the bid If you include negotiated rates not fixed below recourse ratein prorating the capacity allocation then you are not imple menting the FERCs essential rationale that shippers must have the right to bid for the capacity they want at the recourse rate if the pipeline is to be allowed use of negotiated rates By prorating among negotiated rate ship pers you are forcing shippers who only want to bid the recourse rate to en ter into a negotiated rate to get the total capacity they need That underm ines the FERCs only rationale for authorizing negotiated rates We thinktherefore that the next step would be for TW to draft a revision of the initial TW settlement offer expressing whatever changes TW is propos ing in response to Indicated Shippers comments and CPUC s comments I will send in separate email an outline of CPUC concerns re garding TWs original settlement offer This outline summarizes the issues TW may want to consider if it revises that offer Original Message From Porter Gregory J To Passamonti Ida Sent AM Subject RE E TW settlement offer Sensitivity Confidential Privileged and Confidential Ida A response to your questions regarding the citations was provided yesterday under separate cover In regards to TWs settlement proposal we need to know whether the CPUC can settle this case and if so on what terms To date you and I have discusseds everal policy matters It is not practical to think all of them will be addressed in this proceeding let alone in a settlement Therefore it would be most helpful if the CPUC would specifically let us know what it needs to settle We have discussed so many issues that I am quite honestly having difficulty identifying the CPUCs objective in this proceeding as opposed to general policy concerns that could be raised by the CPUC in other more broad based proceedings For instance it is my perception based on our last conversation that CPUC will oppose any settlement that does not prohibit TW from negotiating agreements with shippers that include a rate component based off of published indexes If this is correct is the CPUCs concern the resulting rate ie that the rate may exceed max rates or is it the fundamental structure ie index rates are inappropriate TW will not give up the flexibility to enter into deals based off of published indexes Such deals reflect how the gas market works and are desired by customers Is it possible for the CPUC to agree on specific tariff changes of the nature proposed by TW and pursue broaderp olicy concerns in another proceeding TW would like a specific response to the settlement proposal it provided on ora bout October Obviously the more specific the better However our immediate question is whether the CPUC believes it is possible to reach a settlement based on the process oriented tariff changes proposed by TW or if not what else needs to be considered Please give me a call when you get in today to discuss Thanks Greg J Gregory Porter Assistant General Counsel Enron Transportation Services voice fax Porter Gregory J Original Message From Passamonti Ida mailto Sent Tuesday October PM To Porter Gregory J Subject E TW settlement offer Importance High Sensitivity Confidential We are still reviewing your letters of October and the settlement TW has thus far proposed One practical problem you may be able to help us with In the first of your letters you referenced FERC approval of indextoindex type mechanisms in other proceedings as noted TWs Reply Brief at footnote page not page The footnote of TWs brief however contains inaccurate and incomplete citations Please provide the correct citation for the reference to TransColorado decision the docket number for the Great Lakes Letter order so we can try to retrieve it from FERCs electronic data base or please provide a copy of the letter order and a correction of the date of the letter order re Columbia in Docket RP since a July letter order cannot be found Also please let me know Greg how TW wants to proceed Should we communicate by telephone the CPUCs responses to the TW settlement offer and letters and determine whether TW is prepared to revise the offer pursuant to our responses and those of Indicated SHippers Are weto have a teleconference call including Kathy and Tom or just with Kathy to see where we are on the possibility of reaching a settlement Would TW like an outline of the CPUCs responses thus far including outline of questions or
