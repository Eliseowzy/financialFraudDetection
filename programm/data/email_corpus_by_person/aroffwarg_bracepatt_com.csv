<32060569.1075845710290.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,aroffwarg@bracepatt.com,2001-05-02 04:28:00,Re GreystoneHaywood Extension of Dates Cc Thanks for your email I have highlighted the pertinent Sections and of the Project Development Agreement to the bottom of this email for your review So long as we extend the May date to August regarding Purchasers obligations I think many of your concerns are adequately covered by these Sections This was a big concern of Healys when we did the deal initially and we tried to make it clear that despite a sale of the Interests to AES prior to the deadline for meeting the Development Milestones Developer ENA would remain the exclusive developer of the Property as long as the PDA was in effect Regarding indemnities in Section Purchaser agrees to indemnify Developer and Developers related parties from all damages caused by Purchasers nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant under the PDA Thus if they breach the obligations listed below they are liable to us for damages related to such breach Please call me at your convenience to discuss this issue at your convenience Best regards SECTION Obligations of Purchaser Purchaser shall have the following obligations under this Project Development Agreement a Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Developer in achieving the Development Milestones on or before May b Purchaser shall pay to Developer all payments owing by Purchaser to Developer in accordance with Article III below as and when such payments are due c Purchaser agrees to provide on or before fifteen days after the Effective Date the Base Configuration Information d following Purchasers submission to Developer of the Base Configuration Information Purchaser hereby agrees not to change any of the information contained in the Base Configuration Information in any manner that could in Developers reasonable judgment adversely affect Developers ability to achieve the Development Milestones e Purchaser agrees i not to take any action that is reasonably likely to hinder impede or delay Developers achievement of the Development Milestones or that could make Developers achievement of such Development Milestones more costly and ii to use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly supply to Developer followup information that is consistent with the Base Configuration Information which is reasonably requested by Developer or any Governmental Authority in connection with Developers pursuit of the Development Milestones f Purchaser recognizes that except as otherwise provided in Section Developer is the exclusive developer of the Project provided that Developer agrees to include representatives of Purchaser in all material meetings and discussions with third parties related to the development of the Project including all material discussions and meetings with respect to the TVA Interconnection Agreement and related matters g in the event Purchaser purchases the Interests prior to the termination of this Project Development Agreement all of Purchasers obligations pursuant to this Project Development Agreement including f shall continue in full force and effect and Purchaser agrees to cause the Company and any subsequent purchasers and assignees of the Company to comply with all restrictions set forth in this Section ef as if the Company including any subsequent purchaser or assignee and the Purchaser were the same entity SECTION Miscellaneous a Notwithstanding Section f above but specifically subject to Section e i following Purchasers purchase of the Interests Purchaser may hold itself out as the owner of the Interests so long as Purchaser does so in a manner that does not adversely affect Developers ability to achieve the Development Milestones and ii prior to Purchasers purchasing of the Interests Purchaser may have direct contact with Purchaser Contact Parties as reasonably necessary in connection with the Project so long as x prior to any such contact each Purchaser Contact Party has executed a confidentiality agreement in a form reasonably approved by Developer and y all such contacts and any agreements with any Purchaser Contact Party are made by Purchaser only on behalf of Purchaser and specifically not the Company or Developer b Notwithstanding anything stated herein to the contrary Purchaser agrees not to enter into any agreement with any third party on behalf of the Company or otherwise bind the Company without the prior written consent of Developer which may be granted or withheld by Developer in its sole discretion Purchaser agrees to defend and indemnify Developer and the Company against any Damages suffered by Developer or the Company related to any agreement or alleged agreement entered into between the Company and any third party in violation of this Section b The indemnification described in the previous sentence shall expressly survive the termination of this Project Development Agreement c Purchaser agrees that all information it provides to Developer or any third party in connection with the Haywood Site the Project or the Company ie information provided to regulatory authorities regarding air permit related matters will be factually correct in all material respects Aaron P Roffwarg Bracewell Patterson LLP South Tower Pennzoil Place Louisiana St Houston Texas Ph

information in error please notify us immediately by telephone at or by fax at and confirm that you have destroyed this information and any copies Thank you PM Aaron It is highly likely that AES would exercise their early purchase option in May As such I want to make sure we are thinking about the duties obligations and indemnities among the parties under the circumstance that AES owns the member interests in Haywood and ENA is continuing its efforts to achieve the milestone of the interconnection agreement through August I also want to make sure we have adequate indemnities from AES regarding actions we will undertake to achieve the interconnection milestone At the end of the day ENA will be focused on two things i causing TVA to lower its Network Upgrade estimate from the current level of million and ii causing TVA to produce an interconnection agreement in substantially the same form as the Gleason interconnect agreement Obviously with AES owning the Haywood member interests and being in the drivers seat they will play a key role in whether these two items are achieved I want to make sure that the same standards which applied to us prior to them exercising their early option ie we were on the hook to use reasonable commercial efforts to achieve the milestones now applies to them during the period that we are still trying to achieve the milestones With Stuarts concurrence Id like you to further review the documents and make a recommendation as to what other changes if any we should make to protect our upside under the circumstance described above Thanks Ben Aaron Roffwarg

<19273275.1075845847281.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,aroffwarg@bracepatt.com,2001-05-02 04:28:00,Re GreystoneHaywood Extension of Dates Cc Thanks for your email I have highlighted the pertinent Sections and of the Project Development Agreement to the bottom of this email for your review So long as we extend the May date to August regarding Purchasers obligations I think many of your concerns are adequately covered by these Sections This was a big concern of Healys when we did the deal initially and we tried to make it clear that despite a sale of the Interests to AES prior to the deadline for meeting the Development Milestones Developer ENA would remain the exclusive developer of the Property as long as the PDA was in effect Regarding indemnities in Section Purchaser agrees to indemnify Developer and Developers related parties from all damages caused by Purchasers nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant under the PDA Thus if they breach the obligations listed below they are liable to us for damages related to such breach Please call me at your convenience to discuss this issue at your convenience Best regards SECTION Obligations of Purchaser Purchaser shall have the following obligations under this Project Development Agreement a Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Developer in achieving the Development Milestones on or before May b Purchaser shall pay to Developer all payments owing by Purchaser to Developer in accordance with Article III below as and when such payments are due c Purchaser agrees to provide on or before fifteen days after the Effective Date the Base Configuration Information d following Purchasers submission to Developer of the Base Configuration Information Purchaser hereby agrees not to change any of the information contained in the Base Configuration Information in any manner that could in Developers reasonable judgment adversely affect Developers ability to achieve the Development Milestones e Purchaser agrees i not to take any action that is reasonably likely to hinder impede or delay Developers achievement of the Development Milestones or that could make Developers achievement of such Development Milestones more costly and ii to use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly supply to Developer followup information that is consistent with the Base Configuration Information which is reasonably requested by Developer or any Governmental Authority in connection with Developers pursuit of the Development Milestones f Purchaser recognizes that except as otherwise provided in Section Developer is the exclusive developer of the Project provided that Developer agrees to include representatives of Purchaser in all material meetings and discussions with third parties related to the development of the Project including all material discussions and meetings with respect to the TVA Interconnection Agreement and related matters g in the event Purchaser purchases the Interests prior to the termination of this Project Development Agreement all of Purchasers obligations pursuant to this Project Development Agreement including f shall continue in full force and effect and Purchaser agrees to cause the Company and any subsequent purchasers and assignees of the Company to comply with all restrictions set forth in this Section ef as if the Company including any subsequent purchaser or assignee and the Purchaser were the same entity SECTION Miscellaneous a Notwithstanding Section f above but specifically subject to Section e i following Purchasers purchase of the Interests Purchaser may hold itself out as the owner of the Interests so long as Purchaser does so in a manner that does not adversely affect Developers ability to achieve the Development Milestones and ii prior to Purchasers purchasing of the Interests Purchaser may have direct contact with Purchaser Contact Parties as reasonably necessary in connection with the Project so long as x prior to any such contact each Purchaser Contact Party has executed a confidentiality agreement in a form reasonably approved by Developer and y all such contacts and any agreements with any Purchaser Contact Party are made by Purchaser only on behalf of Purchaser and specifically not the Company or Developer b Notwithstanding anything stated herein to the contrary Purchaser agrees not to enter into any agreement with any third party on behalf of the Company or otherwise bind the Company without the prior written consent of Developer which may be granted or withheld by Developer in its sole discretion Purchaser agrees to defend and indemnify Developer and the Company against any Damages suffered by Developer or the Company related to any agreement or alleged agreement entered into between the Company and any third party in violation of this Section b The indemnification described in the previous sentence shall expressly survive the termination of this Project Development Agreement c Purchaser agrees that all information it provides to Developer or any third party in connection with the Haywood Site the Project or the Company ie information provided to regulatory authorities regarding air permit related matters will be factually correct in all material respects Aaron P Roffwarg Bracewell Patterson LLP South Tower Pennzoil Place Louisiana St Houston Texas Ph

exercise their early purchase option in May As such I want to make sure we are thinking about the duties obligations and indemnities among the parties under the circumstance that AES owns the member interests in Haywood and ENA is continuing its efforts to achieve the milestone of the interconnection agreement through August I also want to make sure we have adequate indemnities from AES regarding actions we will undertake to achieve the interconnection milestone At the end of the day ENA will be focused on two things i causing TVA to lower its Network Upgrade estimate from the current level of million and ii causing TVA to produce an interconnection agreement in substantially the same form as the Gleason interconnect agreement Obviously with AES owning the Haywood member interests and being in the drivers seat they will play a key role in whether these two items are achieved I want to make sure that the same standards which applied to us prior to them exercising their early option ie we were on the hook to use reasonable commercial efforts to achieve the milestones now applies to them during the period that we are still trying to achieve the milestones With Stuarts concurrence Id like you to further review the documents and make a recommendation as to what other changes if any we should make to protect our upside under the circumstance described above Thanks Ben Aaron Roffwarg
