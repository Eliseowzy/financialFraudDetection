first memo got through to you David Forwarded by David L FairleyHOUECT on PM Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From David L Fairley PM To Christopher CT cc Subject Re City of Lakeland Lakeland Credit Reserve Christopher It was my understanding that Structuring had responded to your questions early in the week Apparently your requests were not satisfied so we do need to get together Are there any other questions besides those from earlier Do you have the latest model from Structuring contracts from Legal and term sheet from Origination Please let me know what else you need David To David L CT Janet R CT Evan CT cc William S CT Subject Re City of Lakeland Lakeland Credit Reserve David and Janet I am resending this email that outlines RACs view of the transaction followup needed through the drafting of the documentation and RACs required involvement and the credit reserve tied to the value based on the latest transaction value and structure RAC has seen The CommentsQuestions section of the attached email outlines RACs open issues however we have provided the appropriate credit reserve based on the value that we understand will be markedtomarket As the deal evolves and the value tied to the transaction changes so will RACs valuation and credit reserve It is very important that we are copied on the documentation supporting the transaction so that we can understand the intricacies of the deal as well as Enrons obligations and remedies I have advised Dan Hyvle of RACs need to be copied on the documentation If someone else in legal is running with this transaction during Dans absence please let me know I have scheduled a meeting at PM in Bill Bradfords office to discuss the content of the attached email and any changes in the valuation of the transaction Christopher Manager RAC Ext From Christopher Smith AM To David L CT William S CT cc Evan CT Janet R CT Subject City of Lakeland Lakeland Credit Reserve Dave and Bill I wanted to touch base with both of you on the status of my analysis for the Lakeland transaction I have been working very closely with Evan Betzer ext of the Structuring group as it relates to i the value of the transaction and the key assumptions thereof ii valuing the transaction in accordance with ECTs proposal to Lakeland versus valuing the transaction as though ECT only holds of the position with the other held by Sonat and iii pondering determining if the transportation Max Rate used to value a portion of ECTs transportation obligation to Lakeland is a fixed rate or a variable rate the Structuring Groups model assumes that the Max Rate is fixed for the year term and the delta between the transport curve and the Max Rate multiplied by the associated transportation volumes is the primary source of value of the Lakeland transaction and iv determining why we would not value all transport volumes in a like manner as iii above Separately a considerable portion of the value tied to this transaction is tied to an Accelerated Payment feature ie gas payments are made on the th of the delivery month versus the standard payment date of th of the following month whereas transport payments are made on the th of the delivery month versus the standard payment date of the th of the following month I have not placed any value on this portion of the deal and thus no credit reserve has been assigned to this portion of the deal Valuation I have valued the Lakeland transaction at approximately MM inline with the Structuring groups valuation for the like scenario with an associated credit reserve of M This valuation is based on the following key assumptions ECT is the Seller and no obligations are assumed by Sonat the purpose of this approach is to value the transaction in accordance with the term sheet in front of Lakeland Lakeland will pay ECT Index minus MMBtu on approximately MMBtu of the Firm MaxDQ plus MMBtu paid to the desk and Index minus MMBtu on MMBtu of the Firm MaxDQ plus MMBtu paid to the desk The total PV loss tied to this index minus sale on the Firm MaxDQ is approximately MM FYI I have included this associated monthly loss to ECT as an annuity in the credit reserve valuation process Transport is valued using the Transport curve midmarket price of provided in the Structuring groups model against an assumed Max Rate of MMBtu on real volumes of MMBtu Based on the aforementioned the AA value of transport is approximately MM CommentsQuestions I need to obtain the appropriate forward volatilities for the transport curve I am temporarily using NYMEX vols I need to better understand why we are assigning value to some of the transport and not all of ECTs transport obligation In that light I need to clarify what ECTs remedies and obligations are as it relates to the transport that is being assigned to ECT from Lakeland in a Lakeland default scenario The same questions surround the additional firm transport that is being purchased by ECT to support Lakelands remaining Firm MaxDQ gas volumes approximately Bcf Has an agreement with Sonat been drafted that affords them the opportunity to fulfil a portion of ECTs obligations under its proposal to Lakeland If so this transaction may need to be valued separately and based on such agreements respective terms Lastly based on both the Structuring groups model and my analysis it would appear that the value of the Lakeland transaction resides with the desk The Origination groups value is tied to the value associated with its share of the Accelerated Payment feature of the transaction which RAC has not included in its valuation

Open items for MDEA From Mann Kay Sent Thursday May PM To Rorschach Reagan Fairley David Kroll Heather Subject Re FW Open items for MDEA Need details re item below Please suggest language band of acceptability etc which I will massage and incorporate Rorschach Reagan Heat rates for given output from each machine are incorporated in the bogey model We will establish these for contract purposes in the exhibit that specs out all owned assets Those are the rates that we will discussmodify each quarter Fairley David Even though tweaking heat rates in the stack model periodically at least to be discussed quarterly is subjective MDEA would always want to be as accurate as possible because the the inaccuracy causes the incorrect quantity of gas to be nominated so they underburn or overburn for the day which would get expensive if the extent of the inaccuracy were very much They wear the risk on this Being short or long delivered gas presents a variety of ways in which MDEA has to pay for costs to get in balance Therefore any desire that they might have to improperly shift the bogey to pay us less per MWh costs them more in gas imbalance costs Do I have the latest draft of MarketingRisk policies Rorschach Reagan Yes Fairley David Sent via email but will resend that email for convenience Bogey calc only addresses gas What if the fuel of choice is fuel oil Does the fuel cost and heat rate change Rorschach Reagan heat rates change when switching to fuel oil That info is not available from MDEA If the opportunity presents itself we will evaluate on a event specific basis and agree to the actual cost of production Fairley David The rule of thumb that we will use to look at the Stack Model when burning oil vs gas is about a improvement in heat rate with oil Cost per MMBtu is whatever we plug into the model whether gas or oil and prices change daily and intraday anyway so price changes dont bother us Since the oil is coming out of their tank there is no concern about gas imbalance cost therefore agonizing very much about heat rate modifications when using oil vs gas is not really very practical Please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it is I did a quick search and couldnt find it but I didnt do a page turn to locate it Fairley David It is in the last exhibit MDEA EPMI Incentive Fee Calculation Exhibit XX attached Im not sure that Section and Exhibit XX work well together They were drafted at different times I will send any comments on this in the morning The only thing that we have changed in this

Rorschach Reagan Kroll Heather Fairley David May Tom Subject Open items for MDEA Fairley David Here are issues which Im unclear about all of which impact the drafting of the agreement How are we setting the heat rate Do we have the GADS Is it a daily average weekly average Flat rate Adjusted If so how often Fairley David Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model As conditions change the utilities must update this info We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry it can never be exact but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability No GADS Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions Fairley David Yes their units are too small We have discussed this with the customer and with our internal air permit guys Rorschach Reagan They have Title V permits and they are faxing them to us today They have no run hour limitations on gas however they are limited on oil Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible We have determined that we wont deal with fuel oil right Fairley David We wont buy and sell fuel oil We may dispatch on oil at startup or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable which constitutes a Product transaction with the resulting profit split Rorschach Reagan We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies We arent making money on gas right Fairley David We make money on gas two ways The first is outside the contract and is basicly any internal profit on resale of gas to the Cities The second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product trade and those procedures apply Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet and if so how does it fit in to the picture Fairley David Yes will send separately Is there an uptodate set of exhibits Fairley David The Marketing Strategy the Trading and Risk Policy and the Description of Asset Management have been upated The other Exhibits have not been modified The Marketing Strategy and Trading Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA MDEA commercial not legal and their commentsquestions incorporated It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following in words andor formulae The defn and method of establishing the bogey target production cost formula can be an exhibit which would be great for the commercial team to work on Fairley David Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties Will look at it again Conceptually MDEA Services Group and Orig are in full agreement so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough Rorschach Reagan See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances part of cost of power Fairley David There are three considerations on this who wears imbalance exposure who manages imbalances hourly type activity and who pays for imbalances Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement EPMIs hourly desk manages the loadresource items hourly but MDEA has the exposure physical and price to imbalances Weatherload changes and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances they happen they are uncontrollable and we fix them which EPMIs hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure How are we setting the bogey Formula Fairley David The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the days activities Rorschach Reagan Records of bogey decisions will be archieved Subject to audit Fairley David Yes but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day Frankly they would like to have less involvement ie they trust us to do it all but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day Two bogeys or one gas and oil Fairley David One bogey for power Gas is an input for determining the bogey Rorschach Reagan Bogey set dayahead What is defn of profit I think I have the general idea but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check Fairley David This is in the pricing calcs Should we have a definition What costs are included on the buy and sell side Fairley David see cost definition being provided separately Re stack model a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used Fairley David See definition in my markups to the main agreement Updated exhibit on facilities contracted resources operating limits Fairley David Services and Orig are reviewing these but other than what was mentioned above probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costsprofits Are we clear that Cities buy gas MDEA buyssells power Rorschach Reagan I will be getting exhibits of the

items for MDEA From Mann Kay Sent Thursday May PM To Rorschach Reagan Fairley David Kroll Heather Subject Re FW Open items for MDEA Need details re item below Please suggest language band of acceptability etc which I will massage and incorporate Rorschach Reagan Heat rates for given output from each machine are incorporated in the bogey model We will establish these for contract purposes in the exhibit that specs out all owned assets Those are the rates that we will discussmodify each quarter Fairley David Even though tweaking heat rates in the stack model periodically at least to be discussed quarterly is subjective MDEA would always want to be as accurate as possible because the the inaccuracy causes the incorrect quantity of gas to be nominated so they underburn or overburn for the day which would get expensive if the extent of the inaccuracy were very much They wear the risk on this Being short or long delivered gas presents a variety of ways in which MDEA has to pay for costs to get in balance Therefore any desire that they might have to improperly shift the bogey to pay us less per MWh costs them more in gas imbalance costs Do I have the latest draft of MarketingRisk policies Rorschach Reagan Yes Fairley David Sent via email but will resend that email for convenience Bogey calc only addresses gas What if the fuel of choice is fuel oil Does the fuel cost and heat rate change Rorschach Reagan heat rates change when switching to fuel oil That info is not available from MDEA If the opportunity presents itself we will evaluate on a event specific basis and agree to the actual cost of production Fairley David The rule of thumb that we will use to look at the Stack Model when burning oil vs gas is about a improvement in heat rate with oil Cost per MMBtu is whatever we plug into the model whether gas or oil and prices change daily and intraday anyway so price changes dont bother us Since the oil is coming out of their tank there is no concern about gas imbalance cost therefore agonizing very much about heat rate modifications when using oil vs gas is not really very practical Please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it is I did a quick search and couldnt find it but I didnt do a page turn to locate it Fairley David It is in the last exhibit MDEA EPMI Incentive Fee Calculation Exhibit XX attached Im not sure that Section and Exhibit XX work well together They were drafted at different times I will send any comments on this in the morning The only thing that we have changed in this

setting the heat rate Do we have the GADS Is it a daily average weekly average Flat rate Adjusted If so how often Fairley David Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model As conditions change the utilities must update this info We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry it can never be exact but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability No GADS Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions Fairley David Yes their units are too small We have discussed this with the customer and with our internal air permit guys Rorschach Reagan They have Title V permits and they are faxing them to us today They have no run hour limitations on gas however they are limited on oil Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible We have determined that we wont deal with fuel oil right Fairley David We wont buy and sell fuel oil We may dispatch on oil at startup or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable which constitutes a Product transaction with the resulting profit split Rorschach Reagan We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies We arent making money on gas right Fairley David We make money on gas two ways The first is outside the contract and is basicly any internal profit on resale of gas to the Cities The second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product trade and those procedures apply Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet and if so how does it fit in to the picture Fairley David Yes will send separately Is there an uptodate set of exhibits Fairley David The Marketing Strategy the Trading and Risk Policy and the Description of Asset Management have been upated The other Exhibits have not been modified The Marketing Strategy and Trading Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA MDEA commercial not legal and their commentsquestions incorporated It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following in words andor formulae The defn and method of establishing the bogey target production cost formula can be an exhibit which would be great for the commercial team to work on Fairley David Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties Will look at it again Conceptually MDEA Services Group and Orig are in full agreement so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough Rorschach Reagan See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances part of cost of power Fairley David There are three considerations on this who wears imbalance exposure who manages imbalances hourly type activity and who pays for imbalances Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement EPMIs hourly desk manages the loadresource items hourly but MDEA has the exposure physical and price to imbalances Weatherload changes and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances they happen they are uncontrollable and we fix them which EPMIs hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure How are we setting the bogey Formula Fairley David The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the days activities Rorschach Reagan Records of bogey decisions will be archieved Subject to audit Fairley David Yes but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day Frankly they would like to have less involvement ie they trust us to do it all but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day Two bogeys or one gas and oil Fairley David One bogey for power Gas is an input for determining the bogey Rorschach Reagan Bogey set dayahead What is defn of profit I think I have the general idea but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check Fairley David This is in the pricing calcs Should we have a definition What costs are included on the buy and sell side Fairley David see cost definition being provided separately Re stack model a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used Fairley David See definition in my markups to the main agreement Updated exhibit on facilities contracted resources operating limits Fairley David Services and Orig are reviewing these but other than what was mentioned above probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costsprofits Are we clear that Cities buy gas MDEA buyssells power Rorschach Reagan I will be getting exhibits of the
