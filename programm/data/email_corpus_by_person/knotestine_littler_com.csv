<17107285.1075853114107.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,knotestine@littler.com,2001-08-14 06:38:39,Employment Law Updates from Littler Mendelson Cc I am sending you several updates from our firm You can access the documents by clicking on the links provided If you have difficulty accessing these documents please contact me and I can send you a hard copy In addition feel free to forward these materials to others within your organization or others at different companies or organizations If you do not wish to receive these notices contact me by a reply to this email and I will delete you from my circulation list The first update that I am sending is a publication regarding the ESign Act which took effect on October and which allows electronic signatures to be legally binding Many employers have utilized this statute to move toward a paperless workplace and place all personnel documents online This article addresses the requirements of the act and gives helpful insights into steps to take to move to a paperless workplace Please click on the following link to access this article publicationsartpaperlessofficehtml publicationsartpaperlessofficehtml The second update is an ASAP from our firm prompted by the recent death of Korey Stringer an offensive lineman for the Minnesota Vikings This ASAP underscores the need for employers to be aware of and have procedures in place to deal with the dangers of heat stress for their employees nwsltrasapheatstresshtml nwsltrasapheatstresshtml Also here is a notice regarding our upcoming Texas Employer conferences This year we are adding a half day conference in Austin to our regular conferences in Houston and Dallas Finally I also wanted to alert you to recent developments at the IRS The IRS has basically been out of the independent contractor examination business for over five years THE END IS NEAR As the IRS has been completing its reorganization the Commissioner has moved such examinations up to the being the IRSs number priority Currently there are some IRS Revenue Agents auditors undergoing training in Dallas on independent contractor audit techniques The IRS has been authorized to hire another new Revenue Agents who should be turned loose over the next months Earlier this year the IRS announced a more aggressive pursuit of criminal prosecutions against employers who have failed to timely remit payroll taxes as well as potential civil and criminal prosecution of taxpayers who have claimed to be exempt from payroll taxes See my earlier emails on those issues What triggers status audits Sources of audits most typically come from a computer check of misc which show a high ratio of to W forms issued State audits are most often triggered by referral from IRS regarding misc or an unemployment claim filed by a former contractor Tips provided by disgruntled former contractors are often a source of state audits Adverse IRS SS rulings may now become another source of audit leads Both the states and IRS often target certain industries For awhile in Southern California the intermodal trucking industry was in the IRSs radar All agencies love the new economy as the high tech industry is now infamous for acting without considering the fine points The California EDD has been touring Silicon Valley in recent years and inflicting major wounds almost everywhere it has landed What should you be doing Well this is a good time for a selfaudit If there is a problem minimally you should consider at least changing business practices going forward if not taking corrective action Boilerplate independent contractor agreements should be reviewed not only to reflect state and federal standards which havent really changed it is simply that the sleeping dragon is awakening but to make sure that the contractual provisions reflect the reality of the working relationship and that such relationship is truly an independent contractor arrangement A well drafted independent contractor agreement is simply good prose unless the operational relationship reflects it A poorly drafted agreement or one inconsistent with reality will be deadly What is at stake here When there has been a misclassification as to workers status both the state and IRS can come in and collect all the payroll taxes that should have been taken out to begin with The normal audit window is three years or quarters in CA At the state level that may include income taxes and special employeepaid taxes like SDI as well as employerpaid taxes like unemployment At the federal level there is income taxes as well as social security and Medicare uncapped taxes both the employee and employers share and employerpaid FUTA As a general rule it doesnt matter that the worker paid income and other taxes as a selfemployed person The government may double dip While there are procedures for abating the income tax portion of an assessment the employer has to get an affidavit from the subject workers who are seldom motivated to be cooperate A worst case scenario could regulate in combined state and federal payroll tax liabilities to of compensation paid and that isnt inclusive of potential penalties and interest What can we do to Help You We can with respect to employment status audits do a number of things Proactively we work with clients and their accountants to conduct a selfaudit of their use of such workers identify areas that need to be altered revise standard agreements help create checklists for evaluating the appropriateness of engaging in an independent contractor relationship If you receive an audit notice state or federal we can represent upfront or behind the scenes you in preparing for andor during an audit and we can handle administrative appeals Tax Court and District Court appeals too For companies with criminal tax issues or deficiencies regarding the remittance of employment taxes the IRS and the state can go after the employees responsible on a personal level as a responsible personparty An employee may be personally accountable for a penalty equal to the taxes and interest that the employer failed to remit We have access to a number of highly qualified tax attorneys that are available to work with clients on criminal and responsible party controversies Littler Mendelson is the nations largest law firm representing management in employment and labor
