trading operation which provides by far the biggest part of Enrons profits quite a bit of concern was raised about the news people had been seeing about this changeofcontrol payment Mark Palmer an Enron spokesman said At about pm Central time two senior executives who had attended the meeting John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen told Mr Lay about the reaction of employees Ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether Mr Palmer said Even if Dynegys directors later voted to award Mr Lay a new severance agreement he would turn it down Mr Palmer added Original Message From Armstrong Julie Sent Wednesday November AM To Lohman TK Subject See about traders The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Enron Corp said its chairman Kenneth Lay has decided to forgo a severance payment of million that could be triggered by Dynegy Incs planned acquisition of Enron Mr Lays decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice Early in the day an Enron filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission laid out Mr Lays severance package By midday Enron indicated that Mr Lay would keep only onethird of the payout which he would take in stock in the combined company and that he intended to donate onethird to a foundation to help displaced Enron employees The remaining third would cover incometax liabilities But by the end of the day Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said that Mr Lay following a meeting of Enron energy traders had decided against taking any of the severance pay Though Mr Lay didnt attend the traders meeting senior managers told him that opinions were expressed that he shouldnt receive the payment Mr Palmer said He decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment The opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of Enrons profits Questions for Mr Lay were directed to Mr Palmer who said he had spoken with Mr Lay and other company officials during the day The initial disclosure about Mr Lays hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell Enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago Last Friday Mr Lay even said that Enron had other options to the Dynegy purchase which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent though he declined to elaborate Things werent desperate we had alternatives Mr Lay said The yearold Mr Lay wont have an executive position at the combined company though he might be a director For the months ended Aug Mr Lay received about million through the exercise of Enron options according to disclosure reports compiled by Thomson Financial Last year Mr Lay was paid million in salary and bonus and more than million in stock awards and other compensation Enron the nations largest energy trader saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the companys extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers Those dealings are under investigation by the SEC Last Friday Enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller Houstonbased Dynegy for stock currently valued at about billion The merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies Separately the California Public Employees Retirement System which owns about three million Enron and Dynegy shares said it would oppose the appointment of any current Enron board member to the board of a combined company Michael Flaherman chair of CalPERS investment committee said that it appeared that Enrons board failed in its responsibility to monitor the activities of Enron executives Mr Palmer the Enron spokesman said Mr Lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from forward In February when Enron stock was trading between and a share and Mr Lay was being widely lauded for his performance he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously Last August when Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling quit unexpectedly Mr Lay assumed Mr Skillings duties and his contract term was extended by two years to Dec Under the terms of his contract Mr Lay is entitled to payment of million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract in the event that his employment terminates within days of a change in control Thus Mr Lay is entitled to three full years of payments or million Mr Lay who took charge of the thenHouston Natural Gas Co in when it was a regional pipeline company wasnt the only member of his family to benefit from Enrons heady rise to a global energy giant SEC filings show that in recent years a sister of Mr Lay Sharon Lay and a son Mark Lay received millions of dollars in salary commissions and bonuses related to Ms Lays travel agency and a paperproducts company connected to the younger Mr Lay Mr Palmer said it is a cheap shot to criticize the Lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements The contracts were bid out and fairly awarded Mr Palmer said Ms Lay said her travel agency of which she is president and halfowner had won its Enron business through competitive bidding and by providing the very best service possible Mark Lay couldnt be reached for comment Coming on top of disclosures of Enrons dealings with partnerships run by its own executives the relationships between Lay family members and the company again raise questions about Enrons willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests Former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and possibly other Enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships Mark Lays dealings with Enron date back to according to the available SEC filings In May Mark Lay and certain other individuals who together had been officers directors or shareholders of a company called Paper Print Management Corp or PPMC entered into employment agreements with an Enron unit Enron Capital Trade Resources according to Enrons proxy statement The individuals helped set up a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products according to the SEC filing Mr Palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of Enrons profitable paper and pulptrading business As part of the deal Enron agreed to reimburse PPMC million for certain expenses Mark Lay and his colleagues also agreed to convey to Enron certain intangible property rights from PPMC Mark Lay also got a threeyear employment contract from Enron

Enron securities on Rating Watch Negative senior unsecured debt BBB subordinated debt BBB preferred stock BBB and commercial paper F Pipeline subsidiary A rated senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co and Transwestern Pipeline Co are also placed on Rating Watch Negative The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital market reaction to recent disclosures by the company The loss of investor and counterparty confidence if it continues would impair Enrons financial flexibility and access to capital markets therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business On Oct Enron announced a billion aftertax charge to earnings to be taken in the third quarter of and a reduction of balance sheet equity by billion relating to the unwinding of structured transactions Since that time there have been several damaging news reports on the company and its management More importantly investors have voiced concerns Enrons common stock price has plummeted and spreads on its debt have widened The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its business Approximately billion of unused liquidity is available under committed bank lines An additional concern is that certain structured transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II and Osprey could unwind While various sources of repayment exist such as the sale or liquidation of underlying assets or an equity offering primary credit support is derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger event In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes in either case Enron is required to deliver additional shares If Enron cannot or does not deliver on its obligation then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of Enron representing a general unsecured claim While trigger events include a downgrade of Enrons senior unsecured debt below investment grade by one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with specified declines in Enrons closing stock price over three consecutive trading days Enron would have a forebearance period of days as long as an attempt was being made to register the shares The total amount of Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately billion Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt While capital market uncertainties have escalated Fitch has no information to indicate that there are any fundamental problems with Enrons core wholesale retail and pipeline businesses Fitch expects to be in contact with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor ongoing events and address strategic longerterm issues STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow AFX

partnerships in which Enron had invested dealers said At am Enron was up usd or pct at The DJIA was down points at the SP index was down pts at and the Nasdaq composite down at Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastowrelated transactions In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships LJM Cayman LP and LJM CoInvestment LP which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company McMahon who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enrons Industrial Markets group had quit his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about Fastows role in running the two partnerships according to the Wall Street Journal This morning Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to buy speculative from buyhigh risk to reflect his concerns that lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enrons commercial operations This is the least likely outcome in our view but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked he said nglj For more information and to contact AFX wwwafxnewscom and wwwafxpresscom Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved DJ Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings New York By Mark Golden Kristen McNamara Jon Kamp and John Edmiston Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesEnergy trading companies have concerns about the credit quality of troubled Enron Corp ENE but they have made almost no changes in policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas the companies said Thursday The concerns have arisen because Enron which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the countrys power and gas markets has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure Moodys has put Enrons credit on watch for possible downgrade and some of the companys debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron said John Sousa chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc DYN Its business as usual Williams Cos WMB spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company too has made no changes and has no concerns about Enrons credit Another Top power and gas trading company Aquila ILA has also left Enron credit unchanged Other companies expressed concern though theyve taken little if any action Like everyone else in the marketplace were proceeding with caution said Lora Kinner director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing the North American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel SA Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesnt expect to make any drastic changes Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues By Andrew Dowell Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos WMB to book million in power sales from the previous period as thirdquarter revenues the company said Thursday The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator which runs the states wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions The state of California has paid more than billion for power bought directly from suppliers but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the states ailing utilities in midJanuary Two weeks ago however the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back Its that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday Williams reported thirdquarter net income of million on revenues of billion up from million on revenues of billion in the same period the year before Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales The process is complicated by the states role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities which arent creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves The ISO didnt envision thirdparty guarantors when it set up its settlement process and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month state power officials have said The state says it has set aside billion to cover ISO transactions As reported suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free Willing To Renegotiate Separately Williams officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its longterm contracts with California provided the result benefited both parties California Gov Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of powersupply obligations perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market Malcolm said Were always willing to sit down with a customer Malcolm said Williams hasnt been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts Malcolm said Any attempt by California to force through onesided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants he said To the extent contracts are changed financing is going to go away he said Downplaying Enron Opportunities Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of marketleader Enron Corp ENE saying it focuses on large longterm structured deals not the highvolume physicalmarket transactions that Enron dominates Malcolm said Also TradeSpark the Internetbased energy exchange in which Williams is a partner is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enrons proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald XCFZ suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center Thats interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call Enron which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the countrys power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers Malcolm said TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc ESPD Cantor Fitzgerald XCFZ Shell RD unit Coral Energy

Common Stock NEW YORK NY INTERNET WIRE Kaplan Fox kaplanfoxcom has filed a class action against Enron Corp and certain of the Companys officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas The suit is brought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common stock of Enron Corporation Enron NYSE ENE between January and October inclusive the Class Period The complaint charges Enron Corp and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of The complaint alleges that during the Class Period defendants engaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliates and interested parties which disguised Enrons true financial position Many of the details of these transactions were hidden from the public Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improve Enrons balance sheet thereby maintaining Enron shares at an artificially inflated price Certain Enron executives who held positions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts of interest reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from these transactions The complaint further alleges that during the Class Period Defendants made misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enrons Broadband business in order to artificially boost Enrons share price With knowledge that Enrons Broadband business would never post a profit and was seriously overvalued Defendants continued to make misleading statements about the Broadband business in order to maintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels Defendants used the artificially inflated value of Enrons Broadband business to hedge against in order to gain millions of dollars in financing Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financing

it quite a bit Davidhow could you not talk about it Seventysix million shares yesterday down fifty percent in the last two weeks This is a company withwhata hundred million in revenues James Cramer guest market commentator Maybe Kernen Yeah right Anyone who does any trading in energy apparently you know uses Enron Online so anything that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize the whole energy trading arena and Cramer Go ahead say it Say what youre thinking No one has said it yet We know the truth We believe that Enron caused a national short squeeze They knew every single number in this gas situation They wrecked the California utility system and profited from it Thats my bet My bet that thisthey hadlook they were the market maker Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going to be buying and took it ahead of you I think they cornered the market for electricity for about four months made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and when someonewhen the Justice Department gets in there were going to discover this Kernen Lets see what happened Haines Now wait a second David Faber coanchor Whoa whoa whoa The Justice Department Jim Now is that new Is that something Cramer No that would be if I were a prosecutor something Faber OK so they are not being investigated Cramer Well no Im actually being a little forward thinking Kernen The SEC wants documents about the limited partnership transactions of Mr Faber Which is very different from what Jim is talking about Cramer No Im saying that this is what if I were an enterprising prosecutor I would say Did we have a nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly what was happening with the electricity market which then wrecked the California utility system cost the consumer billions of dollars and is now being hushed up Kernen Well lets talk about the actual news Heres yesterdays trading Haines Wait a minute Kernen Well I just want to say that the guy is gone now Thats the new news here Did you readdid you know that Fastow after four Faber Late yesterday Kernen Yeah after four oclock Fastow is gone Whats interesting Faber Hes the CFO Kernen But hes a new CFO Faber who benefitted personally from some of these off balance sheet partnerships Cramer Mark you know Im not on thin ice here Im not on thin ice Haines I just want to make sure we understand that this is your theory Cramer This is my theory Haines OK Cramer It is just a theory It is my opinion But I think weve got to find out more about that short squeeze that occurred Haines OK Cramer We need to find out whether it was orchestrated Kernen The new CFO might help regain some credibility for the company because he was the old treasurer who left that position a year or so ago because of some disagreements with how Mr Fastow was doing business apparently So now hes back as CFO and well whether that calms the market down Faber Well what they need to do Joe they need to come clean I mean that is what all the investors in Enron and those whove left the company as investors over this last week have wanted Lets see everything be as transparent as you possibly can be tell us exactly what we need to know And as much as they need to come clean with their investors they need to come clean with their trading counterparties because that is really what people are concerned about Kernen Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big deal Anyone who does trading with them if their credit worthiness were to goif their credit rating were to go down how would that affect energy trading Faber Well you want to know that theyre going to be there on the other side and make good on the trades Kernen I guess you would wouldnt you Faber Right Not that they arent but why would youif you can trade with seven other guysseven other companies maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there Kernen Now why would Faber And that would hurt their core business Kernen Why are people expecting some type of action from the credit agencies not because of the stock price right Because of something that could unravel Faber Because of something related to these liabilities they may have Kernen That they dont know about at this point Faber that they may have with regard to funding some of these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at the off balance sheet partnership Will it be a liability They dont know But thats one of the reasons Kernen Were talking hundreds of millions or billions Faber They dont know Kernen But there were billions of dollars in limited partners Faber Yes About three billion in financing I think is what some analysts estimated Kernen This is a pretty big number Faber Yeah they can get to most of that with the assets that they have in the partnerships themselves Kernen I use a six month chart to show whats happened over the last two weeks You got to look at here But if we went back a year youd see eighty as far as the high for Enron Now were at sixteen Faber Everybody else took a hit yesterday Dynegy got hurt Kernen Well I got Dynegy next Dont Here we go Faber Im sorry Im getting a little excited Kernen You are Faber Enthusiastic about your charts Kernen Theres a weekly chart of Dynegy and you know whats coming next dont you Now Im worried about the utility average Ive worried about the transportation average a lot in my career Mark now the utilities have replaced my worries Im angstridden Did you see this chart Were breaking below the Cramer Thats a positive not a negative Joe Kernen Whats wrong with Cramer today What happened Cramer Im all fired up Faber He really is My God hes got the DOJ getting all crazy the FBI the CIA You going down to Enyou going down to Houston yourself Cramer I may just have to I may have to clean up that whole city Kernen Jim why would thethats thenow getting down to the lows I mean the other averages have come back quite a bit from the postattack lows the utilities are retesting those Thats not something to worry about Cramer No because I think theres a lot of money going into more cyclical issues I think the economy is showing signs of getting better The consumer is certainly much stronger than we thought The base book didnt say the corporate was strong but the consumer is strong Much stronger than before Kernen All right In the past people have worried about the utility averages being a leading indicator though I dontwere talking about four hundred to twoninety at this point Thats a long way Cramer This average has got a lot of problems to it but I still think that Kernen Its no longer the Cramer you sell this as safety We dont want safety as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality

Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Enron Corp scrambling to restore confidence in its finances is negotiati ng with banks for a new credit line of between billion and billion a nd is likely to close a deal within days according to officials familiar w ith the matter The new credit line is intended to bolster Enrons financial condition and head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence The new credit would supplement existing lines which are largely tapped out after Enron last week drew down about billion to increase cash reser ves and calm fears in the stock bond and energy markets An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit l ine but said he couldnt supply any further details Houstonbased Enron is the nations biggest energy trader and a principal i n nearly onequarter of all electricity and naturalgas trades Once a favo rite of Wall Street the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convi ncing a deeply concerned investment community that despite difficulties i ts finances remain sound Confidence in Enrons financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier th is month announced a million thirdquarter loss and disclosed a b illion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its thenchief financial officer An drew Fastow Last week Enron replaced Mr Fastow and said that the Securities and Excha nge Commission was looking into the transactions The company has consisten tly said that the transactions were proper and legal Enrons stock price fell again Friday As of pm in composite trading o n the New York Stock Exchange Enron shares were down cents at E nron shares have fallen in the past two weeks and are down from a S ept high of Late last week Enron tapped its existing credit lines with part of that m oney being used to redeem nearly billion of its outstanding commercial p aper or shortterm corporate IOUs Ron Barone of creditrating agency Stan dard Poors said he believes that Enron was getting a bit more resistanc e recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due Thus Enro n probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstandin g he said The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and still leaving the company with an additional roughly billion cash on ha nd would give it more financial flexibility Also last week creditrating agencies warned investors they were reviewing Enrons debt and commercialpaper ratings for a possible downgrade A lowe r rating could hamper Enrons core trading businesses Behind the worries among these agencies in part is the loss of investor c onfidence which one of the rating companies Fitch said in a report last week could impair Enrons financial flexibility and access to capital mark ets therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the companys trading partners are doing business with Enron on essentially the same terms as they have in t he past There has been no significant change in the credit conditions h e said Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giants f inances The banks involved in the current negotiations including JP Morgan Chase Co and Citigroup Inc are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the n ew credit line than they had asked for in the past one official said Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments Confid ence in this company was lost said one bank official involved in the nego tiations for a new credit line But confidence will be restored Corporations of Enrons size commonly establish credit lines only to demons trate to the investment community that in case of an emergency they have a ccess to cash In practice few companies actually make use of these lines Thus drawing down credit lines while providing immediate cash also illu strates the pressure Enron is feeling Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Managers Journal How Enron Ran Out of Gas By Paul Kedrosky The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Is troubled Enron Corp the Long Term Capital Management of the energy mark ets or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too man y of their own press releases Or is poor Enron just misunderstood Those a re the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial rele ases from the beleaguered Houstonbased energy concern A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot While tech stocks were tanking Enrons shares gained during Even diehard Enron skeptics of which there are many had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company Earnings were up and revenues more than doubled Not bad considering where the company came from A decade ago of Enron s revenues came from the staid and regulated gaspipeline business No l onger Enron has been selling those assets steadily partly fuelling revenu es but also expanding into new areas By around of its revenues and more than of its profits came from trading energy and buying and s elling stakes in energy producers The stock market applauded the move At its peak Enron was trading at arou nd times earnings Thats more like Ciscos once tropospheric valuation than the meager times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke Energy But Enron management wanted more It was after all a new economy Webba sed energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded Ac cording to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay the company deserved to be value d accordingly At a conference early this year he told investors the compan ys stock should be trading much higher say more than double its p rice then Then the new economy motor stalled The companys president left under stra nge circumstances And rumors swirled about Enrons machinations in Califor nias energy markets Investors pored over Enrons weakening financial stat ements But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic scholars to penetrate the companys cryptic financials In effect Enrons troubles were hiding in plain sight It should have been a warning Because of the poor financial disclosure the re was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company or how it was trying to make its numbers Most analysts blithely concede that they really didnt know how Enron made money in good markets or bad Not that Enron didnt make money it did albeit with a worrisomely low r eturn on equity given the capital required but sometimes revenues came f rom asset sales and complex offbalance sheet transactions sometimes from energytrading revenues And it was very difficult to understand why or how or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter Enrons financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff Deep inside the compan y filings was mention of LJM Cayman LP a private investment partnership According to Enrons March K a senior officer of Enron is the m anaging member of LJM Well that was a puzzler LJM was helping Enron ma nage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar asset s by entering into derivatives including swaps puts and collars It was in a phrase Enrons house hedge fund There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market it is crucial for a marketmaker But having an Enron executive managin g and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether especially when the Enron executive was the companys CFO Andrew Fastow While he sev ered his connection with LJM and related partnerships in July of this yea r and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week the damage had bee n done As stories in this paper have since made clear Mr Fastows LJM partnershi p allegedly made millions from the conflictridden boardapproved LJMEnro n relationship And recently Enron ended the merry affair taking a billion dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJMs wrongfoo ted hedging Analysts investors and the Securities Exchange Commission were left with many questions and very few answers To be fair I suppose Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a y ear ago saying it had erected a Chinese wall between FastowLJM and the co mpany And in a bull market no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was or questioned the strength of the wall Now it matters as do other Enronhedged financings a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in We didnt do anything wrong is Mr Lays refrain in the companys current r ound of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls That remains to be se en but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment and hero ic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial trans parency Where has Enrons board of directors been through all of this What kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics government sorts and r etired executives exercised for Enron shareholders Very little it seems It is time Enrons board did a proper investigation and then cleaned house perhaps neatly finishing with themselves Mr Kedrosky

about billion in available credit lines and spent about billion to pay off c ommercial paper Now by obtaining even more financing Enron is hoping to convince investors and other energytrading firms

business school pr ofessors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast growing energy trader Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year The US S ecurities and Exchange Commission is investigating multimillion dollar dea ls with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial offic er which resulted in a bn reduction in shareholders equity A hastily convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these relatedparty transactions The departure of A ndy Fastow the aforementioned CFO soon followed With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies Enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines Yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity This marks the end of Enrons walk on the wild side observes Curt Launer an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston the investment bank On the surface events at Enron can be explained by the combination of dete riorating trading conditions a complex capital structure and poor investor relations But the root causes go back further The entrepreneurial cultur e and dynamic management that fuelled Enrons growth in the s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis Therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle new economy magic o n to old economy companies Enrons transformation began in earnest in with the arrival of Jeffrey Skilling who was hired from McKinsey the management consulting firm to develop energy trading For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulat ing US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay a former deputy un dersecretary of energy Mr Lay remains chairman But it was Mr Skilling wh o spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supply ing it The two sides of the business trading and generationsupply have always been strange bedfellows The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility Mr Skillings answer in the early s was to bring in talent from outside the company One of his first recruits was Mr Fastow an expert in securitisation the repackag ing of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself A management structure was introduced with only four layers vicepresident director manager and associate analyst much like a consulting firm E mployees were free to take as much holiday as they liked so long as they d elivered results As one of Mr Skillings early recruits recalled It was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules The seemingly freewheeling style was based on a loosetight management m odel expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman the management writers and M cKinsey alumni At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy b usiness were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets Upandcoming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory Louise Kitchen the yearold British executive who was the creative forc e behind Enron Online the groups internetbased trading platform changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of ri sk legal commitments finance and performance evaluationremuneration Mr Skilling once described the approach in this way As long as you clear you r deals or business ideas through those screens you can do whatever you wa nt around here This approach did deliver growth and innovation As well as making markets in its core energy products Enron now trades everything from weather deriv atives which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable c limatic conditions to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals T he success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world s leading ecommerce company It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint v enture with International Business Machines and America Online the interne t service provider In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazines list of the most power ful US corporations ahead of such corporate giants as IBM ATT Bank of America and Boeing In retrospect however this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was ac hieved at a price First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling In August he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job Personal nonheal th related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explan ation A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity In order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded Enron used a range of offbalance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion LJM the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enrons accounts Other financing vehicles include Osprey Marlin Whitewing Atlantic Water Trust and Azurix They went after too many things too quickly says Stephen Moo re of Moodys Investors Service the credit ratings agency A third cost associated with the last was a loss of financial transparenc y The groups extensive use of swaps options and other derivative financi al instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have li ttle idea of how Enron actually makes its money or the underlying risks t o which it is exposed David Fleischer an analyst at Goldman Sachs summed up the views of many i nvestors during last weeks conference call He told the groups management The companys credibility is being severely questioned and there is a ne ed for much more disclosure There is an appearance that you are hiding som ething or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus The problems in our view stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core ski lls argues Raymond Niles analyst at Salomon Smith Barney Power plants in India water companies extension of their franchise to the mass retail market and using a fibreoptic network to deliver content over the interne t are all unrelated or only tangentially related to their core merchant e nergy business Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for s ome of these ventures This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enr on Broadband was a business worth bn bn in its own right This hel ped push the share price to alltime highs and storing up trouble when tr ading volumes failed to materialise They overpromised on the new business they created says Chris Bartlett a professor at Harvard Business School and longtime watcher of the compan y Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the br oadband business To some extent they are now paying the price Will Enron weather the storm Notwithstanding the risk of further outofth eblue financial shocks most analysts believe that it will The merchant e nergy business remains powerful and profitable Mr Niles at Salomon Smith B arney points out that this side of the group drives more than per cent o f earnings and has shown consistent per cent annual growth over the p ast three years Assets totalling more than bn were also earmarked for di sposal before the current crisis erupted underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the groups portfolio of physical energy assets And yet the doubts remain It is ultimately a question of confidence and credibility Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight man agement methods has tilted too far towards the

BERENSON and RICHARD A OPPEL Jr The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company IS time running out for Enron At the beginning of this year the Enron Corporation the worlds dominant energy trader appeared unstoppable The companys decadelong effort to pe rsuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from Calif ornia to New York Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its vie ws would be heard in Washington Its sales profits and stock were soaring And under the leadership of Jeffrey K Skilling its chief executive Enron s arrogance had grown even more quickly The company based in Houston dripped contempt for the regulators and cons umer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets for elec tricity water and everything else Everyone would win under deregulation Enron said especially its shareholders whose stock would soar as the co mpany profited from creating new markets We are on the side of angels Mr Skilling said in March dismissing th ose who saw the company as a profiteer in Californias energy crisis Peo ple want to have open competitive markets They want fair competition It s the American way But less than a year later everybody seems to have lost especially Enron s investors Enrons stock is plunging and questions about its finances ar e mounting Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupt ed and energy prices could grow more volatile In a worstcase outlook Enr on could become the version of LongTerm Capital Management the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of Enrons shares have fallen more than percent this year erasing bil lion in shareholder value Enron closed on Friday at down cents after hitting a week lo w of earlier in the day The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in California earlier this year a crisis that ende d only when that state contradicted deregulations basic tenets by interven ing deeply in the power market Enrons efforts to become a profitmaking w ater supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capaci ty have been expensive failures In August Mr Skilling quit forcing Kenn eth L Lay his predecessor as chief executive and still Enrons chairman to resume daytoday control of the company The company declined to make senior executives including Mr Lay availabl e for comment and asked that questions be submitted in writing Mr Skilli ng could not be reached Enrons problems boiled over earlier this month when it disclosed that its shareholders equity a measure of the companys value dropped by bi llion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in E nrons regular financial statements The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the companys financial reporting and some investors ques tion whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of tradin g electricity and natural gas THE slump in the companys shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall in its shareholders equity On Wednesday the company forced out its chie f financial officer Andrew S Fastow who is at the center of the controve rsy over Enrons confusing finances The company which six months ago seem ed to be reaping billions of dollars from Californias energy crisis today faces a potential cash crunch The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors smoldering concer n about Enrons opaque financial statements Now with Wall Street analysts and bondrating agencies demanding more information about the complex tran sactions that have fueled the companys profits Enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cas h Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash On Thursday the company drew down a billion credit line it had previousl y arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J P Morgan Chase w hich have each extended at least million But because of Enrons impor tance in the natural gas and electricity markets industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected ev en if the company failed because Enron is mainly a trader rather than a p roducer of energy But a crisis at the company might increase the volatili ty of energy prices which have swung wildly in the last year Philip K Verleger Jr an energymarkets economist emphasized that he tho ught Enron would survive this crisis But he said it was not clear what wou ld happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the companys Enr onOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there are the y good Are the firms hedges good Whats the situation Mr Verleger sa id Its got everyone scared In the short run Enrons credit rating may be its biggest problem If the companys rating falls below investment grade Enron could be forced to iss ue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guarantee d But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less va luable because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of th e company A drop in the companys credit rating could also prompt other energy trader s and producers to back away from doing business with Enron hurting the co mpanys sales and profits Enrons credit rating stands several notches above the critical point But its bonds which are publicly traded have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost percent comparable with many junk bon ds Two of the three major creditrating agencies Moodys Investors Servic e and Fitch Investors Service have put Enrons bonds on review for possibl e downgrades The issue thats in the front of everybodys mind right now is credit said Mark Gurley senior vice president and general manager for trading at Aquila Inc one of the nations largest energy traders Aquila is based in Kansas City Mo For now Aquila and other major energy traders and producers including Rel iant Energy the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy are continuing to do busin ess with Enron And Mr Gurley said that Enrons own trading in the electri city and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling r eminiscent of the collapse of LongTerm Capital Management in They havent done anything tradingwise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down he said Still some executives at other companies said they were looking more caref ully at transactions with Enron especially longterm contracts They also said riskmanagement and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation Mark Palmer an Enron spokesman said on Friday that no energytrading comp any had stopped doing business with Enron He declined to say whether any o f the companys trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms He said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is j ust a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront For years t he details of Enrons finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street analysts whose job it is to follow the company and to the investors who ow n its stock and bonds When Enrons profits were soaring and it was creatin g lucrative new markets shareholders did not seem to care about the impene trability of its financial statements Now they do Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers t o the questions investors ask To others in the industry the opaqueness of the companys financial statem ents parallels Enrons efforts to keep its energytrading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements Though they do not expect En ron to crumble like LongTerm Capital Management they say that like the g iant hedge fund Enron uses a lot of debt regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron cr eated to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet With names like Marlin and Osprey the partnerships have at least billion in bon ds outstanding backed by assets like a stake in Azurix Enrons water comp any subsidiary Enron has promised that if the partnerships debts exceed t he value of their assets Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr Fastow who was chief financial offic er when they were organized led to the billion writeoff in sharehold ers equity that Enron announced last week The company has offered only sk impy details of its transactions with those partnerships Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter after being criticized by shareholders In the process it wrote off a prom issory note that it had carried on its books reducing its shareholders eq uity by billion But because of complex accounting rules the transac tion was not apparent in Enrons quarterly earnings report The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have found a way to hide losses throwing the accuracy of its financial statemen ts into question When Enron released thirdquarter earnings on Oct it reported a loss from billion in writeoffs on failed investments The e arnings statement did not mention the additional billion equity write down But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable a nd its shares rose In a conference call with analysts after the announcement Mr Lay Enrons chairman also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity The referenc e was a brief one however and some listeners did not catch it Those anal ysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done and many were confused by the accounting procedure Enrons stock began to sli de and investors clamored for more information about the writeoff But so far the companys efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors Mr Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts abou t Mr Lays grasp of the situation They say that the two people at Enron w ho appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals Mr Skilling a nd Mr Fastow have both left the company In an interview in late August Mr Lay said he did not know some details a bout the deals involving Mr Fastow In response to one question about them he said Youre getting way over my head Mr Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr Lay did not have a gra sp of the investments at issue saying Mr Lay was handicapped in talking a bout them because of the SEC investigation There is not a whole lot w e can say or should say about them Mr Palmer said He also said the c ompany expected to generate about billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year In a conference call on Tuesday analysts pressed Mr Lay and other top Enr on executives to reveal more information about the LJM writedown and its o ther partnerships Instead they offered only vague explanations of the dea l leaving Wall Street worried that more writeoffs might be coming David Fleischer a Goldman Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the c ompany was among those who came away concerned If Enron is unable to cl arify its offbalancesheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming tha t would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position then the company wi ll likely lose access to the capital markets he wrote in a research note after the call To try to reassure investors Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline it s Internetbased trading exchange executed more than trades that day a higherthannormal volume We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibil ity with the investment community and were working on that Mr Lay s aid in a statement But in the meantime the best evidence of our strengt h is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street Enr ons stock tumbled almost percent Friday to its lowest levels in six yea rs Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enrons offbalance sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston calculates tha t Enron may have close to billion in offbalancesheet debt She said th at Enron had for two years been trying to sell about billion in foreign assets including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India embroiled in a dispute with the state government and she worries about t hose prospects for sale in light of Enrons problems and the souring econom y As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs they may have to write those assets down Ms Coale said On Wedne sday she downgraded her rating on Enron to sell from neutral The bottom line is its really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts Ms Coale said Shortsellers who attacked Enrons accounting even before the company disc losed the writeoff say the companys problems may run even deeper than an alysts fear Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business they s ay The company still isnt disclosing enough to know whether the core busine ss the trading business is profitable said Mark Roberts director of r esearch at Off Wall Street which recommended shorting Enrons stock on May when it stood at The issue remains why are they doing these transactions Our theory has been that the core operations arent that prof itable James Chanos a leading shortseller who has bet that Enrons stock will fa ll said Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits but hiding the losses when deals go against it Mr Palmer of Enron said the company st ood by its reported energytrading profits Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of Enrons positions Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wip ed out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its tr ading book balanced meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset in roughly equivalent amounts by energy it has agreed to buy With these guys they tell us and all youve got is their word that theyre hedged said Mr Verleger the economist IN fact Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation an d disclosure of its trading operations Last year the company successfully lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internettrading platform would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commissi on Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency that oversees wholesale e lectricity and natural gas markets But the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices Largescale energy trading has existed for only about a halfdozen years E nron pioneered the business and now dominates it accounting for about one quarter of all trading in the United States Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale e lectricity a process that began in earnest a decade ago the power busines s was a simpler affair Utilities were given areas of monopoly service and their rates and ability to deliver enough electricity were overseen by state regulators But with the move to deregulate the business independ ent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished providing an ev ergrowing portion of the nations power Beginning in the s the sale and transportation of natural gas was als o deregulated spurring Enron which used to be primarily a gaspipeline co mpany to move into the trading business The companys shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid s with the ascension of Mr Skilling who became chief executive in Fe bruary just six months before his unexpected resignation Underscoring the change in direction in securities filings this year Enron described its p rincipal business as security brokers dealers and flotation Before i t had said it was in the business of wholesalepetroleum and petroleum pr oducts For most of its ascent Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall Street accepted them with pleasure A year ago when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by Mr Fastow the companys former chi ef financial officer analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr Fastows involve ment Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch But the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its shortterm debt will have t o be renegotiated next spring The controversial partnerships do not have t o pay their debts until the following year unless Enron loses its invest mentgrade credit rating before that ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions which could s uffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enrons cred it When LongTerm Capital was stumbling in some Wall Street rivals s old the securities they thought LongTerm owned trying to force LongTerm to sell its positions quickly and at a loss Something similar in energy ma rkets might be possible If so Enron might find as LongTerm did that po sitions that should offset each other do not Enrons new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the companys profits are real and that its condition is better than the shortsellers believe As questions are answered confidence and the share price could rebound But for now investors are skittish and some competitors are eager to take advantage of

Deals By Enron By FLOYD NORRIS The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company AT the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Cor poration are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its ch ief financial officer Andrew S Fastow beginning in the summer of B ecause they were transactions among related parties the company was requir ed to disclose them but the disclosures raised as many questions as they a nswered Following are some questions that investors are asking and the cu rrently available answers Q Why did Enron enter into the deals A Enrons first disclosures in gave no reason In later reports it said it was seeking to hedge certain merchant investments and other asse ts by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommun ications companies Q How did those investments do A It looks as if they plunged in value although there is no clear disclos ure on that Q Why cant that be discerned A The company never said just what the investments were And the transacti ons with the partnerships were complicated involving a variety of derivati ve securities Enron stock and various promissory notes Enrons financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangement s completely Q Why were they so complicated A One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage One a ccounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock If a company sells its shares at each and then buys them back whether for or there is no gain or los s But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet in tha t case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in or paid out on the transactions Enrons transactions appear to have been structured to fa ll under that rule Q Who made money from these transactions A Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals although not a ll of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings And it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors Q If the deals began in why all the uproar now A Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted prof its each quarter they were willing to assume that what was not being discl osed was not really important Q When were concerns raised with Enron A The complaints grew as Enrons share price fell earlier this year By th is summer Enron decided that Mr Fastow would sell his stake in the partne rships Then because the partnerships would no longer be considered relate d to Enron the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the transactions But investors were still worried and Enron later closed out its deals with the partnerships Q How did Enron do A Badly It took a million loss which given the size of the transact ions involved and the previous profits taken was not very much But it als o reduced shareholder equity by billion Q How did that happen A That like so much else is not clear But it looks as if the partnershi p owed Enron that much money could not pay and was let off the hook by Enr on In return Enron terminated previously recorded contractual obligatio ns to deliver Enron shares in future periods Enron treated that like a s hare buyback even though the shares in question had not been issued and d etermined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce re ported earnings Q Is that legal under the accounting rules A Presumably it is But Enrons limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements while leaving profits on t hem That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission w hich has begun preliminary inquiries completes its work FLOYD NORRIS Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All

posing with elementary school children again Given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with CE O clockwork perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things Tha t Have Changed Forever since Sept But lets not be so hasty Not every thing changes that fast least of all Washington The White Houses home front failures are not sudden unpredictable products of wartime confusion but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan This is an administration that will let its special interests particular ly its highrolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the right have veto power over public safety public health and economic pr udence in war it turns out no less than in peacetime When anthrax struck the administrations first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as spe edily as possible to protect Americans but to protect the right of pharmac eutical companies to profiteer The White Houses faith in tax cuts as a pa nacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this weeks Hous e stimulus package showering million on Enron the reeling Houston energy company now under SEC investigation that has served as a Bush campaign cash machine Airport security which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since Sept is also held hostage by campaign cash As Salon has reported Ser viceMaster a supplier of

the Senate majority leaders wife joined the administration in handing the airlines a billion bailout that enforces no reduction in the salaries of the industrys CEOs even as they lay off tens of thous ands of their employees To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes bac k to its creation and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ri dge Mr Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader a successful governor of a large state Pennsylvania who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam A close friend of George W Bush he should have been in the administratio n from the getgo and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various job s including the vice presidency But after being pilloried by the right be cause he supports abortion rights he got zilch Instead of Mr Ridge the administration signed on the prolife John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson w ho have brought us where we are today The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations though Mr Thompson often comes across as a Chamber of Commerce gladhander who doesnt know his pants are on fire and Mr As hcroft often shakes as if hes not just seen great Caesars ghost but perha ps John Mitchells as well Both have a history of letting politics overrid e public policy that dates to the start of the administration Theyve seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the pat riotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No concern PreSept Mr Thompson in defiance of science heartily lent his credi bility to the Bush administrations stem cell compromise by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lin es it would deliver to researchers PostSept he destroyed his credibi lity by understating the severity of the anthrax threat also in defiance o f science Now he maintains that the billion the administration is req uesting to plug the many holes in our public health system almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals not shoring up local hospita ls is adequate for fighting bioterrorism This too is in defiance of a ll expert estimates including that of the one physician in the Senate the Republican Bill Frist It should also be on Mr Thompsons conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal governments house physician David Satcher the surgeon general and a muchneeded honest broker of publi c health locked away presumably because Dr Satcher a Clinton appointe e became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June r eport on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right Only after Mr Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gula g As for Mr Ashcroft he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand informati on about domestic terrorism for political reasons Planned Parenthood whic h has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim n ecessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them has s ought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has neve r been granted one This was true not only before Sept but says Ann Gl azier Planned Parenthoods director of security remains true even thou gh her organization long targeted by such homegrown Talibans as the Army of God has a decades worth of leads on the convergence of international and domestic terrorism Ms Glazier found the sight of Mr Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops offering a million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy Religious extremists dont r espond to money she points out Such is the state of the FBI she add s that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days because we have so many here were afraid were going to lose it perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human service s inspired anything like the confidence that say Mayor Giuliani does the re wouldnt have been a need to draft Mr Ridge Even so hes mainly a PR gimmick a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights As director of hom eland security hes allegedly charged with supervising nearly governmen t agencies so far with roughly a dozen staff members When asked to defi ne Mr Ridges responsibilities Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it wa s a very busy coordination job but so far Mr Ridge is mainly sowing s till more confusion The one specific duty that he has claimed in an interview with Tom Broka w was that hed be the one making the phone call to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld who made no provision fo r any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly codified days after Mr Ridges appointment Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan we ca n only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here even as Mr Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Tali ban once expected to implode in days are proving VietConglike in their intractability The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that inst ead of a thankful Afghan population popular support for the Taliban appear s to be solidifying and anger with the US growing Maybe were losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a CEO from Madison Avenue chosen not for her expertise in policy or pol itics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head S houlders shampoo If we cant effectively fight anthrax I guess its

Tip of the Iceberg By Peter Eavis mailto Senior Columnist TheStreetcom PM EDT URL marketsdetoxhtml Dealings with a related party have tarnished Enrons ENENYSE news commentary reputation and crushed its stock but it looks like that case is far from unique The battered energy trader has done business with at least other related entities according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing Enron Moreover Enrons new CFO who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the relatedparty dealings of his predecessor serves on of these entities And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houstonbased related entity called ES Power The extent of Enrons dealings with these companies or the value of its holdings in them couldnt be immediately determined But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that dont show up on its balance sheet If thats so the companys financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street where the company was long treated with kid gloves Enron didnt immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer Jeff McMahon in the various entities Enrons board members couldnt immediately be reached for comment Ten Long Days Enrons previous CFO Andrew Fastow was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastows role in a partnership called LJM which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron As details of this deal and two others emerged Enron stock cratered The turmoil that resulted in Fastows departure began two weeks ago when Enron reported thirdquarter earnings that met estimates However the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions Since then investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities Enron stock sank Friday meaning it has lost of its value in just two weeks Enrons End Run New financial chiefs involvement in Enron business partners EnronRelated Entity Creation DateMcMahon Involved ECT Strategic Value Corp Yes JILPLP Inc Yes ECT Investments Inc Yes Kenobe Inc Yes Enserco LLC Yes Obi Holdings LLC Yes Oilfield Business Investments Yes HGK Enterprises LP Inc Yes ECT Eocene Enterprises III IncYes Jedi Capital II LLC Yes ECT Coal Company No Yes ES Power LLC Yes Enserco Inc No LJM Management LLC No Blue Heron I LLC No Whitewing Management LLC No Jedi Capital II LLC No Source Detox However Enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities The company has said nothing publicly about McMahons participation in related entities nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Warsrelated names by the relatedparty companies Its not immediately clear what ES Power is or does So far subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power and its formation date January Among ES Power s senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay listed as a director and McMahon and Fastow listed as executive vice presidents A raft of external directors are named as ES Power directors including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan chairman of the Hong Kongbased Hang Lung Group A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isnt commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasnt immediately returned Demands Demands Rating agencies Moodys Fitch and SP recently put Enrons credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the billion hit to equity Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade or junk bonds suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely If Enrons rating drops below investment grade it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least billion in offbalance sheet obligations In addition many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade Friday the company drew down billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enrons condition This week a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron However in a Friday press release CEO Lay said that Enron was the marketmaker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets He added It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets McMahon reportedly objected to Fastows role in LJM allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests But he will need to convince investors that the entities hes connected to dont do the same Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in Now board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity Under The Radar Enrons Flickering Bulb By Christopher Edmonds mailto Special to TheStreetcom PM EDT URL commentchrisedmondshtml While the bulb at Enron ENENYSE news commentary may not have burnt out its clearly flickering To date investors arent sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of reenergizing the company he once built to greatness Whats happened at the Houston energy giantturneddwarf couldve been imagined with any number of neerdowell companies during the wellchronicled bubble But this is Enron As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said I never had to worry about Enrons ability to survive until this week I still find it hard to believe Peter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enrons adventures for some time If youd listened to him earlier this year youd have profited from his knowledge His reporting on Enrons partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding The rumors from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation are for now just that And Enron did not singlehandedly cause the California power crisis nor is Royal DutchShell RDNYSE news commentary about to make a bid to buy the company Sources do tell me that headcount reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business And while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess his departure appears only indirectly related to Enrons current woes Now Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and more importantly its reputation The Companys Challenge But what does Enron do now Its very simple Come clean clean up the mess and refocus on its core business wholesale energy markets risk management and retail energy services They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off and longterm investors should hold firm as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings with upside potential to per share over the next months says Jeff Dietert power analyst at Simmons Co and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery Dietert outlines four challenges for Enron One management must regain the Streets confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balancesheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow Two Enron must maintain its investmentgrade credit rating Three Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans Four Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the writedown in the value of any assets where market value is less than book Straightforward Yes Easy to accomplish No Although Enron says additional writedowns are unlikely except a million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change analysts arent so sure Theyre focused on the companys Global Assets portfolio sporting billion in book value but generating an EBIT earnings before interest and taxes loss of million over the past months The divestitures include million in exploration and production assets in India million in a Puerto Rico power plant and million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General which is set to close in There will likely be others However Enron has to execute here and given the current state of its affairs the seller will feel the pressure The creditrating issue is a fine line The current ratings BBB from Standard Poors and Baa from Moodys are three levels above noninvestment grade However both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades Dietert estimates that Enrons debttomarket cap will be about by yearend and the company has interest coverage EBITDA interest expense of about times By comparison the average SP BBBrated company has a debttocap of and interest coverage of about times The average BB company has debttocap of and interest expense of times Frankly everything falls on Enrons management team and its ability to reassure investors If Enrons management does not step up to calm investor fears these fears could become a selffulfilling prophecy Dietert says In the potentially vicious cycle investor fears could drive stocks down the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades potentially lower credit ratings force counterparties to reduce exposure to Enron limiting Enrons ability to generate earnings and cash flow Its time for Enron to grow up Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk I think it will Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy Its a tough call that requires strict individual discipline Theres an irony to this whole story especially in Enrons lack of candor in reporting its financial results In a muchlauded advertising campaign Enron looking to challenge conventional wisdom asks the simple question Why Ask why Investors are now asking Its time for Ken Lay to answer First Things First Many readers have asked about my relative quietness this week Thank you for your concern My father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade The choice was easy Im with him and my family Enjoy your weekend with family and friends DJ Enron UnitNew England Market Downplay Report Of Default New York By Kristen McNamara Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesEnron Corps ENE retail sales unit defaulted on its credit requirement in New Englands wholesale power market this month but the event was neither unique nor newsworthy the energy company and the organization that developed the markets rules said Friday The operator of the regions wholesale power market informed Enron Energy Services last week that for the third time in months it had traded a greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at risk for expulsion from New Englands market But it was administrative mixups rather than financial problems that triggered the warning which a few other companies have also received in the past the markets rulemaker said I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other participants that have defaulted on their credit agreements and its never been in the news said David Doot secretary and general counsel for the New England Power Pool which developed the policies governing the regions electricity market My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of proportion News of the Enron units default appeared in a trade publication and a major metropolitan newspaper this week as Enrons dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the companys stock and bond prices Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its bonding requirement twice before because both times it corrected the problem within a day spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said The letter sent by ISO New England which operates the regions power market to notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong person delaying the companys response Mahoney said Clearly it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit Mahoney said The company resolved the problem by Oct Mahoney said ISO New England spokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its default Its rare for a company to default three times but it has happened on occasion Foley and Doot said I wont say its commonplace but I wont say its unusual for a participant to find itself out of compliance Doot said Those things have in fact happened from time to time By Kristen McNamara Dow Jones Newswires Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

Enrons Houston offices this week said Paul Paradis a partner in the New York law firm Abbey Gardy Requests also were sent to Enron partnerships such as Whitewing Management and Marlin Water Paradis represents Fred Greenberg an Enron shareholder who is suing the companys board for allowing former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at least million in cash and billion in lost shareholder equity The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of partnerships that bought and sold company assets Enron formed at least such affiliated companies listing executives and employees as officers and directors of the partnerships according to Texas secretary of state records Under Texas law failure to respond to the document requests will result in subpoenas being issued Subpoenas could go out next week if responses dont arrive by then Paradis said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didnt respond to requests for comment about the document requests The executives earned no income from the partnerships Enron spokesman Mark Palmer has said There are no financial interests in the

Officer Kenneth Lay Frevert Whalley McMahon and dozens of other people who list their address as Enrons corporate headquarters serving as officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign business corporations The document requests ask Enron executives for information on any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the affiliates including stock grants and options They also ask the executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the affiliates Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets such as power plants and naturalgas pipelines That allowed Enron to move debt associated with those projects off its books The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money They plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets Enron might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and the debt That could amount to at least billion if the assets dont generate any money a remote possibility the company has said Few

determine if Enron and other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading documents Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento California They are still putting documents in their depository and I dont think theyve completed that process said Alexandra Montgomery a consultant to the committee It remains to be seen whether Enron is complying with its subpoena she said The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in California soared leaving the states two largest utilities insolvent Under Californias plan to open its electricity market to competition the utilities of PGE Corp and Edison International werent allowed to pass rising costs to customers I know that were doing our best to comply with what the committee is asking for Enron spokesman Mark Palmer We are

financial officer Wednesday amid a US Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron million Grand Jury Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for civil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer who convened a grand jury in June Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling the Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay in an x cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey Lockyer later apologized for the remark The attorney generals investigation is proceeding Lockyer spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said Michioku said she didnt know when civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power providers might be filed Our investigation is still being pursued she said We had to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents so that slowed things down a bit Enrons Palmer said he didnt know the status of the attorney generals investigation I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman Palmer said More Lawsuits Enron along with other major power providers such as Duke Energy Corp and Dynegy Inc face at least five lawsuits alleging they manipulated California energy prices in violation of antitrust laws The cases which include separate complaints filed by the City of San Francisco California Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante and various consumers currently are in state

said Bonds Drop Enrons percent bonds which mature in declined points to a bid of cents on the dollar and an offer of cents At that price the bonds which carry a rating of BBB yield percent Investors have grown concerned that the companys credit rating will be cut after billion in thirdquarter losses from failed investments Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions Enrons decision to tap its credit line was a smart financial move said Stephen Moore a vice president at Moodys Investors Service who follows the company It took away the hassle and timeconsuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital Though Enrons bonds have investmentgrade ratings their yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds that carry junk ratings According to Bloomberg data companies with BB ratings pay on average percent to borrow for seven years A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back holdings in other partnerships with its stock diluting the value of Enron investors stock Partnerships called Whitewing Marlin and Yosemite own Enron assets they bought with borrowed money Enron sold the assets to the partnerships to keep related debt off its books The partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the assets Other Liabilities If Enron loses investmentgrade rating the borrowed money comes due earlier leaving less time for the partnerships to find the best price for the power plants and other assets Enron would have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell for and the amount of the debt One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships That

IIs Marlin IIs approximately million senior secured notes due and Osprey Trusts Ospreys approximately billion senior secured notes due on Rating Watch Negative The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes are currently rated BBB This rating action follows the placing of Enron Corps ratings on Rating Watch Negative by Fitch The rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund account prefunded interest and equity commitment from Enron in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock The overfund account is invested in Enron debt securities rated BBB Rating Watch Negative with payments used to service interest to noteholders Payment of principal ultimately relies on Enrons obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred securities Fitch currently rates Enrons preferred securities BBB Rating Watch Negative In addition the transaction also benefits from rights under a million loan to Azurix Europe Limited rated BBB by Fitch Similarly the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the support from the assets in the share trust used to support interest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund principal payments The mandatorily convertible preferred stock has been issued and is being held in the share trust The assets in the share trust supporting interest payments include Enron unsecured obligations the overfund account as well as quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible preferred stock While various sources of repayment exist such as sale or liquidation of the underlying assets

been deposited with the trustee the day prior to the maturity date which is one of the Note Trigger Events In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to

Broadband Services had just signed a longterm deal to provide bandwidth for MSN Microsoft Corps MSFT online Internet service Skilling said Enron would give more details on the deal later After three months without farther word on the deal Enron has broken its silence by suing Microsoft In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County Texas Enron claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal The agreement signed June called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide network capacity and other services to support Microsofts offering of highspeed Internet service according to the lawsuit Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the deal according to

sent Enron a letter dated Oct saying that if Enron didnt provide an operational broadband system by Oct Enron would have breached the contract the lawsuit said Microsoft then would be entitled to recover damages The suit also said Microsoft failed to provide monthly subscriber growth forecast required by the deal In a third breach of the contract the suit claimed Microsoft made public

the bond fell below required levels It was an administrative snafu said Peggy Mahoney a spokeswoman for Enron Its fixed Its no big deal We didnt get the paperwork in on time because it got sent to the wrong desk It was taken care of on Friday According to the letter a Nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous months Having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently said Ellen Foley an ISO New England spokeswoman In the letter ISOs chief financial officer Edward McKenna said his organization has been in contact with Enron Energy Services through multiple telephone communications and to date the financial assurance has not been cured But Mahoney said Enron never received written notification of its previous financial assurance defaults which were corrected almost immediately Therefore she said the company was unaware that the current default was the third which begins the expulsion proceeding In addition she said the current default notice was sent to the wrong person creating the delay that resulted in the letter Were working with ISO New England to figure that out she said The recommended termination is an embarrassment to Enron because the firms director of state government affairs Daniel W Allegretti is the chairman of Nepools Participant Committee which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization This is not that unusual within the pool said Allegretti I frequently receive notices of technical defaults As far as posting the new bond to correct the situation he said We were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork The incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Enron The parent in Houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firms chief financial officer Andrew S Fastow is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with Enron The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing those transactions the company said Monday Enron placed Fastow on leave Tuesday and installed a new CFO Enrons stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the companys financial strength The company reduced shareholder equity by billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by Fastow according to The Wall Street Journal Enron lost million in the third quarter Yesterday Enrons shares closed at down cents on volume of million shares Jeffrey Krasner can be reached by email at Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved FRONT PAGE COMPANIES MARKETS Enrons explanations fail to quell critics concerns Financial Times Oct By JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY Enron has put up a page on its website of frequently asked questions in response to a barrage of analysts enquiries following last weeks controversial results announcement Unfortunately the US energy groups critics have not been satisfied with the answers Nor has Wednesdays decision to replace Andrew Fastow its chief financial officer quelled all investors concerns about its highly complex financial affairs However analysts are pleased that Kenneth Lay chief executive officer is distancing the group from Mr Fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle partnerships It is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move says Ronald Barone of UBS Warburg Its not the end of it The shares which have tumbled since last weeks results ended a shade lower yesterday off per cent at Dollars But analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the week high of Dollars until the group improves its transparency One of the frequently asked questions following Enrons results announcement on October concerned a Dollars bn Pounds m reduction in shareholders equity The Dollars bn was not explained in the news release on the results but mentioned in passing by Mr Lay in a followup conference call Many analysts confused it with a Dollars bn charge in the earnings report It has since been called a loss and a writeoff and Enrons staff have struggled to explain it in plain language Enrons official position now is that the reduction in shareholders equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which LJM a private equity fund formed by Mr Fastow was an investor When the decision was made to terminate these vehicles Enron recorded a Dollars bn reduction in shareholders equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables These adjustments were the result of Enrons termination of obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods The confusion over the Dollars bn has further undermined the credibility of Enron which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission Analysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the groups debt ratio which might hurt its debt rating Mr Lay held an analysts meeting to counter charges that Enron was not transparent But this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts I find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions said Goldman Sachs David Fleischer Other analysts are also concerned about potential further writeoffs Salomon Smith Barneys Raymond Niles points to Enrons investments in its Dabhol Indian power plant its South American investments and its remaining telecoms assets Most importantly he says they may include several of Enrons other offbalancesheet vehicles Frankly we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem

higher than those of industrial bonds that carry junk ratings According to Bloomberg data companies with BB ratings pay on average percent to borrow for seven years A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back holdings in other partnerships with its stock diluting the value of Enron investors stock Partnerships called Whitewing Marlin and Yosemite own Enron assets they bought with borrowed money Enron sold the assets to the partnerships to keep debt related to them off its books The partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the assets If Enron loses investmentgrade rating the borrowed money comes due earlier leaving less time for the partnerships to find the best price for the power plants and other assets Enron would have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell for and the amount of the debt One way would be issuing common shares in exchange for Enron preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships That

oncern with a cash cushion Some observers believe the move is a preemptiv e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted The person also said Enron was talking to its banks about a new multibilliondollar credit line Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong But when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank s aid an Enron spokesman In a statement the companys new chief financial o fficer Jeff McMahon said that by drawing down the bank lines we are mak ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energytrading concern in the past days Enron is the natio ns largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly onequarter of all e lectricity and naturalgas trades Yesterday for example Enron was involv ed in about billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit Since early last week Enrons share price has plummeted Last week it reported a million thirdquarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of billion It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into

looking at a possible downgrade of Enron In order to fall below investment grade Enrons credit rating would have t o fall several notches If that were to happen however a host of bad consequences could follow T ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price a noninvestmentgrade ra ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings In that

about Chewco an Enron spokesman would say only that Micha el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron Mr Fastow repeatedly h as declined interview requests He severed his relationships with the

reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo ard seems to have a broader definition one that might include Mr Kopper According to FAS Statement a relatedparty transaction

Journal The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Enron Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so little about In recent years Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly critic s would say blindly enthusiastic about Enron even as they acknowledge n ot always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted f or its soaring profits Now Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i ts most complicated transactions which many on Wall Street still cant fig ure out In a research note Wednesday Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif ficult to value the company The companys lack of disclosure and transpar ency he says is a longstanding Enron hallmark So is this a stock to avoid in his view Hardly Goldman on Wednesday did bump Enron off its US Select List which consists of a few dozen top st ock picks but Mr Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firms la rger but prestigious Recommended List of or so favored stocks where it has been since he joined Goldman in Just because I cant be specific in being able to create a simple model doesnt mean that you write off that industry and say I cant analyze it or I cant figure it out says Mr Fleischer who owns an undisclos ed number of Enron shares If that were the case there would be an awful lot of industries we couldnt follow Enrons shares have dropped about since last week Every sellside analyst we spoke to early in admitted that this was a black box says Jim Chanos principal of Kynikos Associates in New York who has been selling Enron stock short trading it with an eye to profiti ng from its fall throughout this year It was really a trustme story when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l evel of trust True no stock picker is immune from bad calls And Wall Street analysts lo ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investmentbanking deals to be had But Enron stands apart precisely because so many of the analysts still rec ommending the stock have acknowledged that the companys disclosure practic es are lacking Which raises the question How can an analyst recommend tha t others purchase a stock when key information about the companys operatio ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business arent new Many of the issues now plaguing Enrons stock were first raised more than a year ago b y bearish hedgefund managers and independent accounting experts Yet time and again Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger ing questions about the companys various partnership transactions Besides those partnerships Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings Through it all most analysts have stuck by this onetime stockmarket darli ng publicly dismissing questions about the firms accounting practices and level of disclosure As of yesterday of the analysts who following the stock had a strong buy or equivalent rating on the stock according to Thomson FinancialFirst Call Five others rated the stock a buy thoug h not strongly Only Prudential Securities which downgraded the stock this week has a se ll rating on Enron The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most highprofile exampl es of Wall Street taking a glass halffull stance despite what in retrospe ct seems to be ample warning that a lessenthusiastic approach was warrante d Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Indexs general coll apse analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence part icularly those who like Goldmans Mr Fleischer own shares in the compani es they cover Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investmentbanking fees an d other revenue Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms For instance fo r one million equity offering in led by Credit Suisse First Bost on Enron retained seven comanagers including Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch Enron is a big company and I dont think youre going to find a firm that hasnt been involved says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer who still rates the stock a strong buy with a price target They p ay a lot of investmentbanking fees to Wall Street He adds We do our analysis every day based on the information we have Ar e we here strictly to defend companies Thats ludicrous Were here to pro vide information to investors Yes I have the wrong recommendation o n the stock I dont think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p erformed Mr Fleischer whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron calls his holding a meaningful investment that is not small But he di sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised Mr Fleischer sa ys his clients are happy to know he has a stake in Enron because it show s he puts his money where his mouth is In his research note Wednesday Mr Fleischer called for complete disclosur es of Enrons offbalance sheet partnerships Despite the resulting difficu lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company he wrote that he and many other investors historically have given Enron th e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings and position a s an industry leader Theres not information to really model this and be able to predict accura tely where revenues are going to come from and where theyre going to make their money but every quarter they do he says Its hard to get inside to know all the transactions but they do deliver CSFBs Mr Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company occasio nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the financial press On Monday he wrote that he expects questions about Enron s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue but that he remains confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for Enron an d an ultimate recovery in the share price I know Im wrong on the stock Mr Launer says But he says that at these prices he isnt ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worstcase scenario under which he envisions Enron having to issue as much as billion worth of shares diluting current holders the stoc k doesnt have much further to fall Clearly Messrs Launer and Flesicher arent alone Even in relative terms analysts remain very bullish on this stock says Chuck Hill director of research at Thomson FinancialFirst Call The average rating for a stock o n Wall Street is or slightly shy of a buy rating Enron scores a This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out Mr Hill says In downgrading the stock this week Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i t to sell from buy with a brief stop at hold While she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock she openly concedes her rece nt downgrades come too little too late Ms Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years She says the co mpanys disclosure practices fall far short of ideal and senior executives are often evasive even when presented with direct questions For instance she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission They said no she says

roved by the Republicancontrolled House of Representatives The controversial package worth an estimated Dollars bn over three year s includes Dollars bn for companies next year alone It was approved by the House late on Wednesday by votes to but faces significant amen dment in the Senate which is now under Democrat control It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans who favour cor porate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession and Democrats who in a reprise of the Roosevelt new deal prefer to see i ncreased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars bn to the biggest corporations which they say are renowned for paying l ittle or no tax The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax or AMT introduced in to make sure firms could not avoid all tax payments This strongly supported by President Bush would be mad e retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded The lobby groups and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service calcul ate that this would give a Dollars bn boost to computer group IBM alone while General Motors would get back Dollars m and General Electric Doll ars m Others to benefit include TXU the Texasbased utility that is the USs thi rd largest energy supplier which would would be given Dollars m United Airlines the USs second largest carrier which is warning of bankruptcy would receive

other proposals to boost firms which include a tax break for capi tal investment over three years worth Dollars bn this year alone They say these amount to a giant corporate giveaway Mr Bush and other

Section C Harvey Pitts SEC From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy By FLOYD NORRIS The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company CAN the new friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy Harvey L Pitt the new SEC chairman set out this week to show that he is not like his predecessor Arthur Levitt In a speech to the American Ins titute of Certified Public Accountants an organization whose senior lead ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr Levitts reform efforts Mr Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h is predecessor From now on he promised the commission will make sound decisions in a respectful affirmative way not in a demeaning demanding or demonizing wa y He spoke favorably of pro forma earnings reports in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev en the worst profit figures look pretty There was no mention of Mr Levitt s concerns about improper management of earnings On the heels of Mr Pitts speech the SEC used a minor enforcement acti on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t o report their own errors The decision itself was reasonable although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years But the way the SEC trumpeted it raised qu estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th an a guard dog Is this amnesty for financial fraud Jane Adams the ac counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former SEC staff me mber asked in a report to clients She was not sure of the answer In an interview yesterday Mr Pitt dismissed such worries No one is goi ng to get away with anything he said What we are trying to do is crea te an environment where people feel comfortable and can talk to the SEC without feeling we are looking for a big splash A major embarrassment for accountants is having the SEC force a client t o restate its numbers Mr Pitt and his chief accountant Robert Herdman a re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made I am very much i n favor of a vigorous enforcement program Mr Pitt said in the interview but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state ments and restatements Mr Pitt talks of companies getting it right the first time which woul d certainly be nice But there is a risk that companies will become more ag gressive in their accounting figuring there will be no real penalty like a restatement if they are caught That would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting In trying to sound comforting to the accountants group an organization that as he noted he had represented as a lawyer for two decades Mr Pi tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence The proof of course will come in the performance Fortunately the mess a t Enron gives the SEC a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image I t will take time for the commission to determine if the companys accountin g was proper But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai n rather than obfuscate as it has so far the strange deals it made wi th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer This could a former SEC staff member said focus the issue on whe ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur es And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite Photo Harvey L Pitt Copyright Dow

United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest Rule No in CEO school Never say that your company may soon collapse Seems kind of obvious but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief J ames Goodwin who

Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulti es to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations The leaders of one un ion have petitioned the companys board of directors to have him sacked Bottom line CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth but s ometimes it doesnt pay to be too candid about worstcase scenarios either Especially when that scenario is the companys own demise Forget the Victory Gardens Lets Have a Comfortable War Sure were at war with a band of cavedwelling outlaws hell bent on our an nihilation But would all freedomloving Americans please go out and buy so me DVD players Maybe even a nice new car That was basically the message from the Treasury Department on news that C ongress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism ef forts and rebuilding following the attacks Officials at Treasury applauded the sentiment then politely suggested it would be even better for the eco nomy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff The economy is per haps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the wa r on global terrorists says Betsy Holahan a department spokesperson Wa r bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism For the record we dont think an issue of war bonds would be dumb just su perfluous After all nothings stopped Americans from buying generic savin gs bonds or better yet Treasuries all of which finance spending by t he federal government In the meantime its a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war bonds which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice at the same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop War bo nds notwithstanding were a long way off from the era of ration books Enron Again Last week we noted the

rating agency said in a report issued on Monday Moodys Investors Service said that in the third quarter it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for US companies At the same time it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just companies That to ratio is far greater than the to ratio in the second quarter In dollar terms the situation looks more dire Moodys warned it may downgrade billion of debt dwarfing the billion Moodys said it may upgrade by to Particularly in light of September the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes said John Puchalla Moodys senior economist A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year Rating reviews are significant because unlike actual rating changes they are not a lagging indicator and suggest the future direction of corporate credit Moodys normally wraps up its reviews within three months US corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons These include the weakening US economy an inability of marginal companies to raise cash debtfinanced merger activity and fallout from the Sept attacks on such industries as airlines insurance and travel For example Moodys in July warned it may cut Comcast Corps ratings after the Philadelphiabased company bid billion for ATT Corps cable TV operations Then last month Moodys warned it may cut Chicagobased Boeing Cos ratings because of the attacks potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes In the third quarter Moodys warned it may

warned it may downgrade companies and raise a mere four On Monday it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade Puchalla however said the decline could slow next year in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should

AssetLight Focus By Mark Golden Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones On the face of things its hard to understand the stock markets headspinning reaction to Enron Corps ENE revelation of some bad news in recent weeks Why the talk of a death spiral for North Americas premier energy trading company The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc CSCO for example saw an almost identical drop over a similar month period Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco The difference is that over the past few years Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle not hard assets and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question If youre buying network components you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier After all youre buying something you can touch But if youre buying power or gas what youre really buying is a commitment to deliver If your supplier doesnt come through when the market gets tough youre left totally exposed In Enrons energy trading business then credibility at every level is critical For now Enron looks to be more than viable But the companys assetlight strategy might not be Gross profits from trading have shrunk to in the third quarter from in the first quarter of Meanwhile assetheavy energy companies like Mirant Corp MIR and Calpine Corp CPN successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure Two weeks ago Enron reported a million thirdquarter loss resulting from billion in writeoffs That didnt send investors running however In fact its stock price rose a bit on the news What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets or shareholders equity by billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow That along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities Exchange Commission produced a billion drop in Enrons market value On Monday Moodys Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enrons senior unsecured longterm debt to Baa from Baa leaving it two steps above junkbond levels The agency kept Enrons ratings on watch for further downgrade LongRunning Concerns A hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a reduction in shareholders equity The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enrons loss of credibility Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them but few on the call believed that For some analysts Enrons revelations only fed longrunning concerns about the companys lack of financial disclosure Cary Wasden managing partner of Reed Wasden Research has had a sell recommendation on Enron since March Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms Wasden isnt in the business of selling stock His firm isnt involved in brokerage and isnt a hedge fund Wasden gets paid for his research and the company doesnt invest in the securities it covers A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from onetime sale of physical assets in operating income His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldnt immediately respond Dont believe by any means this is the end of the story Wasden said Wall Street sellside analysts have largely kept Enron as a buy or strong buy as the stock fell from to But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enrons reporting For now the plunge in the price of Enrons shares and bonds which last week started trading like junkrated debt hasnt hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners We havent changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices Were watching it and so is everybody else but they are a solid company Reliant Energy Inc REI spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that Im sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point Keeping Talent A Challenge Enron is a big company far too big to ignore But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders transactions with Enron If the companys investmentgrade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed risk managers wont be able to ignore it whatever else Moodys does Assuming that doesnt happen Enron still faces a tough road ahead Like all companies Enron is the combination of capital and talent For financial companies talent is the more important ingredient and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year The losses can be expected to continue Much of the top management cashed out when the companys stock price was high and moved on Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on if they havent already Over the years Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry Those options are now nearly worthless If Enrons debtservice costs rise the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top When Skilling left nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lays assurances that it was for personal reasons When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week Lay said In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO Thats putting words in Wall Street analysts mouths Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer I dont know anybody who said that Wasden said What did the CFO do what did Skilling do that Ken Lay wasnt part of Real change will have to come from without Wasden said Enron has been a cult more than a company he said Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company it just changes the disciples Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside Nevertheless Wasden thinks Enrons stock has reached its natural floor and if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money it can recover over time There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets like pipelines and power plants he said That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating Given the bind Enron is in Lay wont have much choice Enron will survive but it wont be the same company at all By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow

Enron Corp ENE the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money But it wont be traders who will cash in on this new potential It will be classaction attorneys Theyre already lining up to sue Enron in at least five shareholder suits As of Oct two of lawsuits had been filed against Enron in federal court and three more in Texas state court Most of them name as defendants Ken Lay Enrons longtime chairman former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow Enrons chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence Oct Still another suit which isnt a class action suit was filed naming as defendants members of Enrons board of directors All the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships Enron set up many of them managed by Fastow Most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the Fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with Enron The transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband water and other Enron investments Fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions As Enrons chief financial officer he was being paid to manage the corporations finances As general partner of two LJM partnerships he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with Enron He shared in profits of those partnerships When investors began demanding information about the transactions Enrons share price began to slide With the heat on Enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked million related to losses from early termination of the deals among other things Thats when the class action attorneys went to work So far at least law firms are representing the plaintiffs Enron didnt respond to calls asking about the lawsuits Among the law firms representing plaintiffs is Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes Lerach which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit The release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than billion from class action lawsuits The lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market Some of the deals with the LJM partnerships run by Fastow purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market according to Abrams and Franks v Enron et al That could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months Market skeptics have said Enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth Enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties a total of in the second quarter of this year according to Enron Now market watchers will want to know if any of Enrons trades were done with the LJM partnerships managed by Fastow They will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with Chewco Investments That Houston company according to a report in The Wall Street Journal was managed by Michael Kopper and was set up in when Kopper was a managing director with Enrons Global Equity Markets Group He left Enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by Fastow Do the plaintiffs attorneys know whether Enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships I think if is too early to tell Thomas Bilek of Hoeffner Bilek told Bandwidth Beat As you know information is coming out in drabs and dribbles from Enron It could be several months before plaintiffs attorneys get a chance to ask Enron officials those questions Bilek said Its also too early to tell what potential damages plaintiffs could win said Steven Schulman an attorney with Milberg Weiss At this point you can only talk about it in terms of shareholder losses and the losses are in the billions Total losses will depend on the price each shareholder plaintiff paid for the stock and the price at which each shareholder later sold the stock Enrons share price topped out between and in the summer of last year It set a week low Oct at That spread leaves plenty of room for losses Schulman told Bandwidth Beat that the record for losses in shareholder cases is billion in a case involving Cendant Corp CD Damages are usually a substantial portion of losses Schulman said Whether the Enron case is bigger or less I couldnt opine he said This is a big case by any means By Michael Rieke Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

AFX Enron Corp said it has reduced its shareholder equity by bln usd as the company decided to repurchase mln of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer Andrew Fastow the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition Enron did not disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday when the Houstonbased energy giant announced a bln usd charge to thirdquarter earnings that produced a mln usd loss However the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday As a result of the reduction Enrons shareholder equity dropped to bln usd the company said In an interview Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said about mln usd of the bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM CoInvestment LP a limited partnership created and run by Fastow In a conference call yesterday with investors Lay said mln shares had been repurchased by Enron as the company unwound its participation in the transactions In the third quarter the companys average number of shares outstanding was mln According to Rick Causey Enrons chief accounting officer these shares were contributed to a structured finance vehicle set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM were the only investors In exchange for the stock the entity provided Enron with a note The aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of Enrons broadband telecommunications and other technology investments Causey did not elaborate on what form those hedges took Subsequently both the value of Enrons stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply the report said As a result Enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares When Enron reacquired the shares it also canceled the note it had received from the entity Given all the complexities of the LJMrelated financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company the confusion factor wasnt worth the trouble of trying to continue this Causey

percent at per share Enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years on Tuesday after taking charges of billion against earnings to cover expenses and writedowns on investments that fall outside its core wholesale energy operations The reduction in shareholder equity was not mentioned in the companys earnings statement but was discussed by Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay in an earnings conference call with analysts and investors on Tuesday Confidence has been shaken by the incremental disclosure This is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much said one analyst who asked not to be identified The reduction in equity was prominently reported in the Wall Street journal on Thursday bringing it to the attention of a wider audience analysts said Lay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of Enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some Wall Street analysts As a result of the operation Enrons debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about percent but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around percent by the end of next year Lay said Moodys Investor Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enrons longterm debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially reduced valuations for several Enron businesses Some of Enrons financing arrangements

The energy giants stock closed down or percent at per share making a cumulative loss of percent for a week in which Enron reported a thirdquarter loss of million its first quarterly loss in over four years Analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the Wall Street Journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron I dont think this thing passes the smell test said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity I think the CFO should be out of there right now In the interest of the stockholders that CFO should be gone he said Enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements but Fastow severed his ties with the LJM partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities POOR JUDGMENT Analysts said that at the very least the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at Enron which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of highprofile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer Jeff Skilling in August For a company that had a lot of question marks around it already these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade It points to poor decisionmaking on behalf of the board and top management at Enron he said Enron North Americas biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity was one of Wall Streets high flyers last year when its stock posted a gain of percent The stocks ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the companys plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy trading platform This year Enrons shares have fallen percent as sentiment toward

number of other energy companies into the telecommunications business Now investors are wondering whether Enron is leading the charge out of telecom The company announced Oct that its broadband unit lost million before interest and taxes in the third quarter on revenue of million In the third quarter of last year the unit lost million on revenue of million Enron also recorded a million nonrecurring charge for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter of this year That amount included severance costs for cutting jobs loss on sale of inventory and the reduced value of Enrons content services At an analysts meeting Oct Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay said the broadband business is not that robust right now Industry revenue is low and theres substantial overcapacity in the bandwidth market more than even we anticipated Lay said The company still has a problem finding creditworthy counterparties for bandwidth trading Consolidation in the telecom sector has also eliminated potential trading partners A year ago it looked like an excellent business to get into he said Others thought so too Looking back Enron could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital Lay said It spent too much too soon An Ominous Comparison He compared Enrons move into telecom with its move into the water business with its Azurix unit That comparison probably wont be good news to those who still have broadband jobs at Enron Azurix caused Enron to take a bigger writedown million than broadband in the third quarter The water business has been a bigger and longerlasting headache than broadband Maybe Enrons surviving broadband employees will feel better knowing that Lay told analysts the company is exploring alternatives to preserve its play in telecom at a reasonable price so it will be ready when the business recovers Its trying to reduce general and administrative costs in broadband to million a quarter and is on track to reach that goal next year he said It could cut those costs even more in order to sustain the business Meanwhile the company is trying to determine which parts of the telecom business it wants to be in he said Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley told analysts the company needs to determine how much network and hardware it needs At one time they had thought that they wanted to use physical network assets as a springboard Whalley said Now they wouldnt want to forever be in the network business Both executives mentioned the possibility of joint ventures in telecom Lay said other companies are asking Enron to do them Whalley said the company has talked about exchanging fiber and other assets The one part of the telecom business Enron still seems committed to is broadband intermediation Intermediation is a term the company uses in most of its commodity businesses said an Enron spokeswoman Its a combination of trading and deal origination wholesale and enterprise customers More Bad News Expected Rebecca Followill a research analyst for Howard Weil Labouisse Friedrichs Inc she had expected a larger writedown in broadband for the third quarter If you look at how much the stocks of their peers in broadband have fallen youve got to figure that their assets values have fallen similarly Followill told Bandwidth Beat I was expecting more like an writedown in broadband Another analyst who didnt want to be identified said he also expects more broadband writedowns from Enron To the extent that they can take more writedowns I think it would make eminently good sense to do it He predicted a million haircut in the first quarter of next year because of a goodwill valuation issue And that might not be the end of it Enron had a net of million of broadband property plant and equipment at the end of last year he said They had another million of risk management asset receivables inventories and working capital items Followill doesnt see much future in broadband for Enron I think the business will shrink to the point where it wont be shown as a key sector in their reporting she said Enron might keep a small broadband group in case the market rebounds she said Her investor clients dont expect broadband to contribute to Enrons earnings within the next three years She thinks Enron is looking for an exit strategy The other analyst said Enron

those critics dont understand his bandwidth business Watson told Dow Jones Newswires in an exclusive interview They dont understand how the business world has changed since the Sept terrorist attacks he said In announcing thirdquarter results for Dynegy Monday Watson said the bottom in bandwidth demand was reached on Sept and that the market would begin recovery in the fourth quarter of this year Businesses are reassessing where to store data and how to distribute operations to avoid losing everything in a sudden catastrophic event be it of natural or human origin Thats whats driving the recovery he said Also businesses will avoid travel he said relying instead on video conferencing Enron Corp ENE Chairman Kenneth Lay said Tuesday that he hasnt seen any signs of recovery in telecom The bandwidth market is suffering in part because there are few creditworthy companies to trade with he said Theyre trying to find trading partners for broadband Watson said Thats going to be tough to do Dynegy isnt concentrating on bandwidth trading because there isnt a realistic model for it yet he said I said two years ago it was at least two years away I still think its probably at least two years away before we actually call it a trading commodity The metroarea infrastructure that Dynegy and other companies are building will create connections between networks which are needed in order to trade bandwidth as a commodity Watson said Its unfortunate that Enrons model for bandwidth as a traded commodity is the dominant image for the entire market Watson said Dynegys model includes telecom contracts negotiated directly with customers for longterm supply of bandwidth Dynegys bandwidth trading desk is staffed by four people For the past several months they have been buying bandwidth for Dynegys customers The goal has been to build a customer base Were looking at being an intermediary and really looking at the same customers that we feed energy today Since Dynegy lit its routemile network two weeks ago the trading desk has been trying to fill the companys network instead of buying bandwidth from others Im trying to find enterprises that have communication requirements Watson said He pointed to ChevronTexaco Corp CHX as a target for those services They have offices that never talked to each before he said Now theyve got to talk to each other I would say that the credit quality of Chevron and Texaco is pretty reasonable ChevronTexaco owns about of Dynegy said a Dynegy spokesman Dynegy and ChevronTexaco already have a large energy trading relationship which includes natural gas and gas liquids The average burn rate of Dynegy Global Communications the corporations telecommunications unit is million to million a quarter Watson said In the third quarter it lost million down from million in the second quarter Dynegy predicts that Global Communications will break even or record a small loss before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter If we can get to income of million per month thats what we need really he said If we can get there by the end of next year Ill be very happy I think by this market will have righted itself Watson believes telecommunications has the potential to transform Dynegy Dynegy is an energy company he said Our energy merchant company is doing very well and business is growing like a weedTelecommunications is not

Inc All Rights Reserved UK Jobs in base metals down but definitely not out By Amanda Cooper Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON Oct Reuters Dismal industrial demand and the fickleness of hedge funds seduced by more volatile markets have slashed London Metal Exchange members profits over the past year and set off a gathering wave of job cuts The decline and fall of base metal prices in the past year and a half has prompted a series of highprofile companies to withdraw from the market casting a pall over next weeks yearly LME Week industry gathering in London Jobs have gone from front office to back in trading houses and banks raising questions about the prospects for those now seeking work Good people can always be placed As long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire Sarah Gilley of Londonbased recruitment group Exchange Consulting said Where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies Last week ScotiaMocatta a subsidiary of the Bank of Nova Scotia and a key ring dealing member unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the LME floor prompting around job losses among traders phone jockeys and clerks Then blueblooded banker NM Rothschild Sons closed its London and New York base metals units It left its core precious metals business intact but base metals staff were laid off in the process In the same week the LMEs largest floor trader Enron Metals said it planned to cut to percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut to jobs in the Enron Group SECURITY With three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security What were finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so theyre keen to stay put Gilley said So whereas someone who might be a big moneyspinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years they are now staying for three to five years They probably feel that theyre reasonably safe where they are theyre well recognised and not going to stick their necks out she said BONUS FEARS October has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by LME week functions and conferences Also traders tend to be looking towards their annual performancelinked bonuses which are usually announced at the end of the year Those who are in work at the moment are sticking Often at this time of year people are hanging on for their bonuses But I dont think any of them are anticipating good bonuses Theyre probably just happy to have a job Sian Griffiths of Exchange Consulting said LME volumes traded have been fallen over the past months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hitech and telecomms stocks Metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market Companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal A lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now realigning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it Gilley said The other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing she added As for morale in the

Bonds Headed For A Fall Companies issued special zerocoupon bonds assuming th eyd never have to pay them off Now shareholders could be on the hook for a billion tab Janice Revell Fortune Magazine Time Inc Copyright It was an irresistible proposition Borrow billions of dollars pay no inte rest reap millions in tax breaks and then wait for the debt to simply dis appear That was the promise of zerocoupon convertible bonds and companie s from Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money But of course there was a catch For this scenario to play out a company s stock price had to rise sharplyand quickly Thats because investors b ought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equityif the stock ta nked the bonds would no longer be worth converting So to make them more a ttractive to buyers companies had to build in an escape hatch If the stoc k price failed to rise sufficiently investors could put that is sell the bonds back to the companyin many cases after just one year And thats exactly whats about to happento the tune of some billion over the next three years Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas t half of these special hybrids the prospect of conversion is now absurd It simply wont happen So bondholders are looking to get their money back the first chance they can And because of the put feature that is possible Suddenly companies like Tyco Comcast and dozens more are on the hook fo r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought theyd never have t o pay That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies After all theyre the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt comes due Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay bondholders Companies without enough cash and the majority fall into th is campare likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow money anew That means sharply reduced earnings Especially at risk are inv estors in companies with poor credit ratingsprime candidates for killer r efinancing costs Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o ff the debt creating significant shareholder dilution especially at curre nt depressed prices To make matters worse this is happening at a time whe n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin king This is a ticking time bomb warns Margaret Patel manager of the P ioneer High Yield Bond fund a topperforming junk fund The seeds of this mess were sown in mid when the stock market started to falter Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling stock while their share prices were struggling Zerocoupon convertible bo nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didnt have to ma ke cash interest payments on the bonds hence the name zero Instead iss uers offered an upfront discountfor instance investors would buy a bond for and collect when it matured Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n umber of common shares But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantlyin many cases b y more than With that protective feature called the conversion premiu m zeros took off Corporate issuers would pay no interest and once their stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels the debt would be swep t away into equity If the bonds are converted its a home run for everyb ody says Jonathan Cohen vice president of convertiblebond analysis at D eutsche Bank That fourbagger of course depends entirely on the stock price rising If it doesnt the bondholders armed with that handy put feature can simply sell the bonds back to the company Great for bondholders but not so hot for the company or its shareholders But hey what are the odds of that ha ppening CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u p says Cohen They dont worry about the bond getting put If all this seems a little complicated thats because it is A reallife e xample should help Californiabased electric utility Calpine issued bil lion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt At the time the company s stock was trading at about a shareseverely undervalued in the opin ion of company management We really didnt want to sell equity at that po int says Bob Kelly Calpines senior vice president of finance So the co mpany instead opted to sell zeros setting the conversion premium at a heft y Still with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile the bonds werent exactly a scre aming buy for investors So Calpine added the put feature Investors could sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric e eliminating any downside risk Things havent exactly worked out as management had hoped The stock has si nce plummeted to and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens e So its looking as though Calpine will be liable for the billion in b orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April Th eres also the refinancing cost According to Kelly Calpines borrowing ra te could run in the neighborhood of an extra million per year in cash Obviously nobody plans for their stock to go down Kelly says I dont think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put Calpines potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i s straddling junk If you are a borderline investmentgrade company a fin ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the world notes Anand Iyer head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta nley The problem is there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r atings out there Jeff Seidel Credit Suisse First Bostons head of convert iblebond research estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall into the junk category And others are at risk of having their ratings dow ngraded before the put date Today with junk yielding as much as per centage points above bonds rated investment grade refinancing can be a pri cey proposition Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high price of junk It has million in zeros that it will probably have to b uy back this January and another billion coming down the pike over th e next couple of years Because of slower thanexpected sales the company was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies And if Solectrons credit is downgraded the zeros would slide into junk status a situation that could cost the companyand its shareholderstens of mill ions of dollars in refinancing charges Refinancing isnt the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros Comp anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bondsup to of th e amount raised If the debt is sold back many will have spent millions fo r what essentially amounted to a oneyear loan Theyre getting bad advice claims one banker who didnt want to be named Look at the fee the bank er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into As if those potential consequences were not scary enough shareholders can also get whacked when the bonds are first issued Thats because some a re bought by hedge funds which short the companys stock sell borrowed sh ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price at the same t ime that they buy the bonds If the stock goes down the shorts make money from their position If it goes up they profit by converting the bond to s tock This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet at l east for a while Grocery chain Supervalu for example recently lost o f its market cap the day it announced it was issuing million in zeros Despite all the pitfalls the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu es thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro vide In fact the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form of financing Even better thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code companies c an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than theyre act ually paying All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest if certain conditions prevail Verizon Communications for instance would pay annual interest on its billion in zero bonds if its stock pri ce falls below of the issues conversion price In the eyes of the IRS oddly that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction for tax purposes of the same rate it pays on its regular debt Wh y Trust us you dont want to know That adds up to an annual deduction o f more than million even if Verizon never shells out a dime in intere st Not surprisingly more than half of the zeros issued in contain si milar clauses Its an incredible deal for them says Vadim Iosilevich w ho runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management Not only are they raising cheap money theyre also doing tax arbitrage So despite the enormous risks to shareholders companies continue to issue zeros at a steady clip According to ConvertBondcom seven new issues tot aling billion have been sold since Oct alone I think the power o

Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This is a rough era for American business icons Subject to the vagaries of age Jack Welch product failure FordFirestone tires competition Luc ent ATT technology HewlettPackard and Compaq and dotbomb bubbles CMGI managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky busin ess The latest example is Enron whose fall from grace has resulted in a p roposed fire sale to Dynegy Once considered one of the countrys most innovative companies Enron becam e a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conf licts of interest The journalistic accounts of Enrons struggles drip with schadenfreude hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mi rage We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is n eeded High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norm s But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh re velations emerge Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that h ave enduring value Deregulation and market competition Enron envisioned gas and electric p ower industries in the US where prices are set in an open market of biddi ng by customers and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit En ron was the leader in pioneering this business Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the US and is spreading to Europe Latin America and Asia The winners have been consume rs who have paid lower prices and investors who have seen competition fo rce the power suppliers to become much more efficient The contrary experie nce of California the poster child of those who would reregulate the powe r industry is an example of not enough deregulation Innovation and the deintegration of power contracts Under the old re gulated model of delivering gas and electricity customers were offered a o nesizefitsall contract For many customers this system was inflexible a nd inefficient like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure by the truckload Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the e xact needs of the customer To do this Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent parts starting with price and volume location time etc and offered c ustomers choices on each one Again consumers won Enrons investors did t oo because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors Arguabl y Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the process of Creative Destruction But creative destroyers are not necessari ly likable pleasant folks which may be part of Enrons problem today Minimization of transaction costs and frictions Enron extended the logi c of deintegration to other industries An integrated paper company for i nstance owns forests mills pulp factories and paper plants in what amou nts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate ac tivities better than smaller specialized firms Enron argued that integrat ed firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from burea ucracy and the captive nature of customers and suppliers Enron envisio ned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the bet that the freemarket terms would be better than those of the internal operations The development of freemarket benchmarks for the terms by whic h divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the economy Exploiting the optionality in networks In the old regulated environment natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pi peline Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a nu mber of possible sources opening the customer to the benefits of competiti on and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network so that they cou ld nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any mome nt in time to the best use and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons This policy picked up by others in the industry created tre mendous value for both customers and suppliers Rigorous risk assessment The strategy of tailored contracts could easil y have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the tradi ng risks that the firm assumed and of very strong internal controls Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among th e best anywhere Particularly with the advent of Enron Online where Enron made new positions valued at over billion each day it became essential to have uptothesecond information on companywide positions prices and ability to deliver The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by the firm but with fears among trading partners about Enrons ability to fi nance its trading activity In a world where contracts and trading portfoli os are too complex to explain in a sound bite counterparties look to a thi ck equity base for assurance It was the erosion in equity rather than tra ding risk that destroyed the firm A culture of urgency innovation and high expectations Enrons corporat e culture was the biggest surprise of all The Hollywood stereotype of a ut ility company is bureaucratic hierarchical formal slow and full of excu ses And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company Enron only years ago is even duller and slower Enron became bumptious impatient lean fast innovative and demanding It bred speed and innovation by giving it s professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses create markets an d transfer within the firm Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion and an ope noffice design fostered brainstorming The firms organization and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a l arge corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs This was a lightning rod for the firms detractors And yet it could serve as a model for more hidebound enterprises to emulate Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformatio n of American business It created a ruckus in oncequiet corners of the bu siness economy It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in which it did business It thrived on volatility The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major RD establis hment especially given Dynegys track record as a second mover following E nrons lead Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and timeconsuming ant itrust review Dynegys greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enr ons spirit of innovation its own Or so we all should hope because prospe rity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake thei r industries Messrs Bodily and Bruner are professors at the University of Virginias Gr aduate

Wessex Water of Britain as well as other noncore assets in India and Brazil after a financial crisis nearly brought its ma in energy trading business to a halt That crisis led to Enrons decision e

to the discuss ions said The sale has also attracted the attention of industry rivals lik e Thames Water owned by RWE of Germany But such a combination would most likely incur a long review by

billion that Enron paid for it in analysts sa id In hindsight we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses Kenneth L Lay Enrons chairman and chief executive told analysts in a co nference

Dow Jones Company Inc When ATT last week completed the secondbiggest bond sale in history ca pping one of the busiest bond periods in years it came as welcome news a mid fears of a credit crunch Here was new money meaning new spending on p lants equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump That billion ATT deal and a slew of similar bond deals from big com panies ranging from Boeing and AnheuserBusch to Kraft Foods and General Mo tors may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on That is because corporations like homeowners are in the midst of a refinancing boom Corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap but b ecause they often cant get money in other crucial markets In particular they are sidestepping the commercial paper market shortterm corporate I OUs used to finance daytoday operations where rates traditionally are lo west because investors are unwilling to finance many wellknown corporat ions The result has been a huge jump in bond sales the majority of which are us ed to reduce existing debt Since the Sept terrorist attacks about billion in investmentgrade bonds have been sold up from about billi on in the yearearlier period Overall issuance this year is likely to set a record clearing billion compared with billion in The driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short term commercial paper to longterm debt says John Lonski chief economist at Moodys Investors Service a creditrating agency Usually rising bond issuance presages economic growth In corporatio ns sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates But the n companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operation s a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late s This time around the surge in bond deals wont pump in enough new money to the economy to make a dramatic difference Though as in the case of the m illions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly payments it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporatebalance s heets and help to fund some of the companies daytoday operations Not all of the money being raised is to refinance shortterm debt of cours e and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nations biggest bor rowers have ready access to funding if they need it But most companies are similar to ATT which last week provided the bigges t refinancing example yet Over the next three months the telecom company was facing billion in expiring commercial paper Under normal conditions corporations pay off ma turing commercial paper by rolling over that debt or issuing new commerc ial paper to replace the old But rolling over commercial paper became much harder for ATT after Moodys cut the companys shortterm and longterm c redit ratings Through the bond deal ATT raised money at relatively attra ctive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercialpaper market Other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives to the commercialpaper market through bonds loans or revolving credit lin es The ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital marke ts says Meredith Coffey senior vice president at Loan Pricing Corp a d ebtmarketanalysis company For the most extreme cases the bond markets dont offer refuge Enron ham mered by a thirdquarter loss of million that led to a string of downg rades drew down billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay investors in its commercial paper It then turned to its banks for an addit ional billion loan to pay off more commercialpaper investors thus tidi ng it over until it could merge with rival Dynegy Most investmentgrade companies arent nearly so bad off and thus have rea dy access to bond investors General Motors for instance had little troub le selling billion in debt last month while Ford Motor easily sold bond s totalling billion But the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investmentgrade companie s are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their mone y Take Ford Standard Poors and Moodys downgraded Fords debt ratings las t month to tripleBplus and singleA respectively With that rating Fo rd is far enough down the spectrum of investmentgrade debt that many of th e ultraconservative investors in commercial paper wont touch it meaning t hat it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt Ford concedes that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the comme rcialpaper market Boyce Greer the moneymarket group leader at Fidelity Investments says he often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign of eroding profitability even before they get downgraded You cant wa it around for a rating agency to downgrade a company he says Moodys has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so far this year Thus the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk t o trillion at the end of October down from trillion at the end o f last year Fridays Credit Markets Last week was a brutal time to own Treasurys The market sold off so sharpl y as

Counterparties to Enron which is one of the principal marketmakers provi ding liquidity in the energy market are seeking to limit their exposure to the group in spite of reassurances from both Enron and Dynegy that the ta keover will go through Experts also say the implications of the deal are so complex that the regul atory review could take much longer than the six to nine months company off

worried about systemic risk both in the energy market and in financial markets where companies such as Enron use derivatives to offset the risk of energy price fluctuations Enron was close to meltdown until Dynegy stepped in with a rescue bid da ys ago having persuaded credit rating agencies not to downgrade Enrons de bt to below investment grade Clauses built into the merger agreement signed with

foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit Of these t he most controversial has been Enron and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd DPCL This apart the experience of investors in the reformed power sector i n Orissa is also unhappy Five years ago Orissa was the first state to ado pt the World Bankrecommended model of separating generation transmission and distribution of power and an independent regulator The Godbole Commit tee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well Clearly separating the three functions is a complex restructuring Maybe i t helps privatisation the current fashion on the subject having been set i n Thatcherite Britain While some privatisations in UK have succeeded the experience has not been consistent all over Take UKs rail sector While privatising the government in its wisdom deci ded to separate the ownership of the rail network Railtrack and the owner ship and operation of trains The contractual relationship between the vari ous operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine bewilde ringly complex system of penalties and incentives to be monitored by an in dependent regulator Such separation had no parallel Besides Railtrack suffered from poor mana gement cost escalation in modernisation of tracks etc Several serious ac cidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult The reform d id not work and Railtrack was put back under public control last month What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeedin g Pretty poor if the experience of Orissa is any guide It faithfully sep arated the three functions and privatised distribution and part of generat ion AES a foreign company was per cent investor in a generating compa ny and per cent in CESCO a distribution company As Gajendra Haldea an alysed in this paper on August The policy and regulatory framework was inadequate and myopic Distribution losses a euphemism for power theft were much larger than the companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation CESCO defa ulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO the transmission company which in turn defaulted to the generating company Indeed all CESCOs cash inflows are now escrowed leaving it no money even to pay salaries For all practical p urposes the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation pe rhaps beyond redemption and the reform is a total mess The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingnes s to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers For a while cr oss subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the househol d and the agricultural segments However as the burden became too large the commercial sector started movi ng to captive generation further worsening SEB finances An independent regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem He may fix economic prices but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors puni sh power thiefs face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is c ut off So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative as sadly they are the institutional restructuring is no substitute for subst antive action No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to get out Enron too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country over and above its dispute with MSEB It had attracted a lot of adverse publici ty for gouging power consumers in California a state in a power crisis se e World Money February The Internet craze also had a hand in Enr ons misfortunes It became an energy trader established an electronic tra ding platform had broadband ambitions went into a disastrous diversificat

accounts To top it all last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act ivities Enrons chief financial officer who was supposed to be in charge of these has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated with him was involved in them The SEC is investigating the affair and Enr ons share price is down per cent since midOctober There are some repo rts that Shell may make a bid for Enron After its ratings were downgraded Enron is desperate for liquidity and anx ious to dispose its assets DPCL was already on the platter now a sale has become even more urgent Reportedly Tatas and BSES are interested so are the lending institutions Clearly if a settlement is to be reached this is the optimum time But one is not very optimistic For one Delhi and Mumbai will be involved and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs Our byzantine decisi onmaking processes make timely decisions impossible Further if a deal do es take place there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption It i s much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and De lhi to allow the drift to

JIM BARLOW Staff Houston Chronicle STAR Copyright WILL wonders never cease Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on the table Mark McGwire the homerunhitting baseball player for St Louis retired And he let it be known that he never signed a twoyear million contrac t his agent negotiated last spring Why Because he wanted to find out if h is injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before It didnt and he decided he wasnt worth that kind of money Then Ken Lay chairman of Enron Corp said he wont take the million he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when En ron is sold to Dynegy Corp Of course neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback r etirement plan sacking groceries at the supermarket carrying them to the car and hoping for a big tip Still it was a class act on both their part s McGwire only hit last season well below his lifetime average And Lay Well lets say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has a company sunk as fast as Enron Remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of a share Now it s hovering in the singledigit level and Enron is being forced to sell its elf to a smaller rival The stock price incentive How did Enron get into this position Put the blame on the companys relent less drive to push up its stock price And a big reason for that push comes from the way American companies compensate top executives In the last couple of decades executive compensation has soared The avera ge chief executive officer today makes times as much in salary bonuses and stock options as the average factory worker Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really arent relev ant Most of the money top executives receive doesnt come from base pay or bonuses but from stock options Such options usually work this way Executives are given hundreds or thousa nds of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future date The sales price can be anything from cents to the price of the sto ck on the date the options were granted If the stock increases past the ex ercise price in the option the executive can buy the stock and then sell i t making big bucks It the stock has dropped below the option price its underwater in the jargon then those options are worthless Granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareh olders those who favor this sort of incentive say And thats true if you talking about inandout traders But its not true if were looking out f or the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term Keeping the debt hidden Keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down Enron To hype the stock Enrons execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel it s amazing growth and some of its dicier investments in partnerships Enron was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals That way it could m ove a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership That in turn made the companys earnings look better When Enrons executives finally fessed up they had to write down their pro fits over the past few years by percent But the real irony here is that percent is still a heck of a lot of money But by that time the majori ty of shareholders simply had no faith in Enrons bookkeeping Now look at Lays compensation In he exercised stock options and made million on them In sales of options brought him million a nd this year about million according to a study published by Bloomberg News Was Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitab le I dont think so He was simply following the latest fad in corporate g overnance He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders The shareholders were happy with that high stock price Nobody besides so me stock analysts complained about Enrons often impenetrable bookkeepin g until that stock price started to fall Would Enrons bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fe wer stock options Maybe Fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys And no one would want that job if he were only going to make million a year instead of million Just

in the price of crude oil and in shares of big o il companies some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the longterm p rospects for energy stocks These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities said Tina Vital an oil and gas analyst at Standard Poors who recommends a broad group of integrated oil companies including Exxon Mobil ChevronTexaco R oyal DutchShell BP and TotalFinaElf They have excellent management a top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors she said provided that investors are patient and can bear shortterm swings Last weeks price declines were set off by Russian oil companies refusal t o accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries f or big production cuts They were a reminder that the sector is extremely v olatile Oil could go to a barrel short term she said but there i s no certainty of that The oil producers could reach an agreement by Janua ry sending prices upward Over the long term she expects to see productio n cuts Demand for energy has grown only percent this year and prices have bee n declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline as drivers hav e seen at the gas pump West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at on the New York Mercantile Exchange up cents from its Thursday close the lowest since June But an economic recovery expected by late could cause demand to pick up analysts say As oil prices have dropped so have the prices of most oil stocks but not as much as the overall market since the beginning of Over that period the S P energy index has lost percent while the S P stock in dex is down percent A report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept terrorist attacks had intensified the countrys economic slowdown t hey are not expected to result in any longterm volatility in energy market s The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise perc ent a year through instead of the percent predicted only a year a go Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks WHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term L Bruce Lanni s enior oil analyst at A G Edwards Sons in New York said that any potent ial price war was likely to be fairly shortlived because neither OPEC nor nonOPEC countries could withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period of time and prices should rebound sharply as a result back up in the lower to mid range Low prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term but Mr Lanni too sees value in the stocks His top pick is Conoco now trading at his month target is We remain confident he said that the companys annual oil and gas p roduction should grow by about percent on average over the next several years Conocos debt at percent of capital is relatively high but he expects the companys strong cash flow it equaled a share last year to reduce the debt level to percent next year and to percent in T he companys aftertax interest cost is only percent he said Mr Lanni also favors KerrMcGee a natural gas exploration and production company and BP calling both undervalued He regards Exxon Mobil Royal Du tchShell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced so he is not recommending buyi ng them now If you own them hold them he said William Featherston executive director and an oil and gas exploration anal yst at UBS Warburg said he felt nearterm caution but mediumterm optimi sm for sustainably higher natural gas prices He said he would encourage investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies over the next two months His top picks are Apache KerrMcGee and EOG Res ources Such stocks are highly volatile he said They are tradingoriented vehic les and shortterm volatility in commodity prices generally provides the m ost attractive entry and exit points he said While natural gas prices declined throughout most of this year prices rose at a startling pace fr om per million cubic feet at the end of September to over per mill ion cubic feet within weeks He cited three reasons for the price rally a decline in gas surpluses pre dictions of a colderthannormal winter and what he has called pathetic t hirdquarter natural gas production despite record drilling activity The tangled finances of the Enron Corporation were also a factor in the rec ent price increase for natural gas futures he said Enron which marketed billion cubic feet a day of natural gas or more than percent of the nations demand is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Comm ission and announced a billion reduction in shareholder equity from de als with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer It also reported a thirdquarter loss and restated earlier earnings Enron has agr eed to be taken over by Dynegy a smaller rival for about billion in st ock Dynegy is also assuming about billion in debt Anxiety over whether the Enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or ha ve other market repercussions led to an increase in prices While it is d ifficult to quantify the Enron factor Mr Featherston said the shortte rm effects on natural gas prices seem to be over OTHER factors of course could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors over the next several months The status of the war against terrorism Pre sident Bushs decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve thus helpin g OPEC in reducing excess global capacity and a United Nations review of t he foodforoil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a signi ficant impact on battered oil prices Nevertheless Ms Vital said for the long term energy will probably be in short supply and new sources must be developed So she also likes the pro spects of two drilling companies Noble Drilling and Nabors Industries Bot h took a beating last week along with

out of its bid for the company the Financial Times said citing Aquila Aquila said it began making contingency plans in case Dynegy withdrew from its billion takeover of Enron the paper reported Enron the largest energy trader decided to sell after its shares plunged this year and a federal investigation of accounting irregularities limited its ability to finance operations Enrons collapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets where the company does onequarter of all gas and power trades Dynegys agreement to buy Enron allows it to withdraw from the transaction under certain circumstances the FT said PERSPECTIVES A tale of greed and hubris Waldo Proffitt Sarasota HeraldTribune All F Copyright For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of public utilities the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly of relying on unregulated profit driven enterprises to supply our energy A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street the poster boy for the uti lity industry its stock selling for about a share Last week its stock was worth about percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought by a competitor There was fear the companys bond rating might fall to th e junk level What happened It will take months if not years to untangle the details but it is clear that the main culprit was greed closely followed by hubris Not too many years ago Enron was a small struggling gas pipeline company in Houston As deregulation spread to more and more states Enron began acq uiring pipelines gas producers and utilities It also acquired friends in high places especially the Bush family and the ir key political advisers And it discovered it could make money faster by selling and trading energy than by producing it Enron sold many of its ge nerating plants and became the biggest power broker in the nation Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked Ca lifornia consumers of tens of billions of dollars Enron was one of the fir st power barons to take advantage of Californias flawed deregulation law virtually written by instate and outof state utility companies The California fiasco soured probably most Americans on utility deregulat ion but Enron was not singled out for calumny and management saw no reaso n to examine its business ethics Contrarywise management had visions of even greater profits which it felt no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders The chief financial off icer and other highranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary part nerships which made deals with Enron I do not understand the details of th ese arrangements but neither do independent accountants the Securities an d Exchange Commission or congressional investigators It does seem clear th at the Enron insiders made millions for themselves Enron acknowledges without explaining that stockholder equity dropped billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overs tated profits by some million Whether this was by design or by mistak e is in dispute but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the c onfidence of investors So much for greed Back to hubris It seems not unlikely that Enrons leade rs felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of cornercutting be cause they had friends in high places The chief executive Kenneth L Lay was and is a personal friend of George W Bush and has easy access to the White House For many months after the new administration took office Karl Rove Bushs top political strategist owned Enron stock valued at to and sold it only after h e had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gain s tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest Lawrence Lindsey the presidents chief economic coordinator and I Lewis Libby V ice President Cheneys chief of staff owned stock in Enron and Lindsey wa s paid last year as a consultant for Enron Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bushs four political campaigns one unsuccessful for Congress two for governor and one for president In Enron and its employees gave to Bushs campai gn to the Republican National Committee and to the Pres idential Inauguration Committee Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy key subCabinet appointments administration action or inaction in the California energy mess and the o verall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favo rable to the interests of Enron And now a couple of questions Is it possible the unusual financial maneuve rs by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilme n in the Bush administration Were those of them with heavy investments in Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company Was Enron right in thin king its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to reprimand Or in light of our preoccupation with terrorism will the Enron case get m uch attention from the federal government Or from voters Waldo Proffitt is the former editor of the HeraldTribune

Copyright The Times Mirror Company Try finishing this sentence The best thing about my experience as an inve stor in was Many Americans contemplating the losses theyve suffered this year in the stock market might say there was nothing best about what happened to the min fact nothing good at all perhaps other than that it might have been worse With share prices on the rise again the damage to portfolios has been less ened Even so stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks to keep this from being the markets worst calendar year since The bluechip Standard Poors index rose last week but its sti ll down year to date Yet those losses while certainly not trivial especially when theyre your s can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this years experiences With investing adversity can be a more important teacher than success If youre having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful about anything investmentrelated try these on for size Asset allocation is no longer just a quaint theory The paramount inves ting rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk But i t took the worst stock bear market in years to bring this lesson home fo r many people who thought equities only rose in value Now millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much they can lose in stocksand how bonds and shortterm cash savings can off set market losses and preserve capital It has been a hard lesson to be sure But investors who take asset allocat ion to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in the long run And dont underestimate what that can mean for your peace of mind long term The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned In the late s many economists lamented how the US savings rate continued to shrink Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be rising nonstop In other words many Americans were letting the stock market do their savin g for them when share prices were rising or more each year Now with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns on stocks in this decade its clear that many people will have to find a way to save regularly if theyre going to meet their longterm financial go als especially retirement This may not be a pleasant reality but its better for most people to have faced this fact sooner rather than later while there may be time to make up lost ground A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and thos e who tout them The markets slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street analysts money managers and others whose knowledge understanding and jud gment were clearly lacking in retrospect Investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present the mselves as experts is a highly dangerous strategy if it can be called a strategy at all Sure it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the mo on and nobody had much use for reviewing a companys fundamentals But that wasnt investingit was speculating and on a massive and ultimately rui nous scale People have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the mar ket and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their por tfolios in the long run Just ask anyone who shifted their entire k retirement savings sum into aggressivegrowth mutual funds in the first quarter of right before the market peakedbecause of the bullish comments of some yearold tech stock analyst Those investors arent likely to make a move like that agai n Freemarket forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies Capi talism may be harsh but its efficient when the good times end and its ti me to find out which companies truly have talent and staying powerand des erve more capital Hundreds of dotcoms have failed but who really misses them Is it any har der to find what you want on the Internet It probably would have been much worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors funds for another year instead of failing when they did But the market isnt just eliminating small companies that never had much o f a future The financial nearcollapse of energy giant Enron Corp exposed a business that twisted accounting rules to

James K Glassman Dont Be A Puddnhead Diversify James K Glassman The Washington Post FINAL H Copyright The Washington Post Co All Rights Reserved Warren Buffett who was probably the greatest investor of the th century is fond of quoting the salacious actress Mae West as saying Too much of a good thing can be wonderful In the market such a motto would lead you to avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks y ou really really like Peter Lynch who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the th cent ury calls spreading yourself too thin diworseification Smart witty and brilliant at picking stocks Buffett and Lynch may not nee d diversification but the rest of us do When you own one stock youre ou t on a limb For example very few analysts with or without a conflict o f interest predicted that shares of Enron the energy and trading compan y would tumble by percent in a year Put all your eggs in a basket like that and you end up with a gooey mess The more stocks you own as long as they are in different industries the more the overall riskiness of yo ur portfolio is modulated The reason you dont want a superrisky portfolio is simple While Warren B uffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the valu e of his holdings most investors are not A portfolio that increases in pr ice by percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year rises by t hreequarters the second and rises by percent the third But reasonable investors prefer the consistent ride It prevents them from doing something stupid such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money dur ing that first disastrous year Consider the sad case of James D McCall who earlier this month resigned a s manager of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty mutual fund Two years ago Mer rill wanted McCalls services so desperately that the firm went to court to pry McCall away from his previous employer Pilgrim Baxter where he rang up impressive gains in the late s His big success was called PBHG Lar ge Cap And when they got McCall Merrills brokers raised more than billion from their clients for him to invest While the average growths tock mutual fund owns about stocks with the top holdings representi ng about onefourth of the portfolios total value McCall specialized in w hat are called concentrated portfolios In the case of Merrill Lynch Focu s Twenty he owned as the name implies just stocks At last report hi s top holdings accounted for a whopping twothirds of the funds assets If McCall had spread his stocks among say a dozen different industries he might have smoothed his ride Instead percent of his assets went t o technology firms The Focus fund and a smaller one that McCall ran called Premier Growth were launched in March Within just months all but million of the clients original billion had vanished It is hard to imagine losing as much as Focus Twenty did even if you tried As of Nov the week McCall resigned the fund was down percent for t he year compared with a loss of percent for the Standard Poors s tock index the benchmark for fund managers According to the latest report from Morningstar Mutual Funds of McCalls stocks had declined durin g the only exception being HarleyDavidson More amazing of the losers had fallen by at least half By the way Enron was McCalls seven thlargest holding This fund has had a wretched existence wrote Morningstar analyst Kunal K apoor who did admit a grudging admiration for McCalls perseverance McCal ls faith may turn out to be well placed over time Kapoor said Unfortun ately time ran out My point here is not to pick on McCall but to reveal the perils of concentr ation Buying Focus Twenty as a technology fund and consigning it to no mo re than onefifth of your holdings with the rest of your assets in diversi fied conventional stocks or funds might have made sense but Focus Twenty was touted as a longterm capital appreciation fund not a sector fund Here it failed but maybe it didnt have to The manager who made the concentrated fund popular Tom Marsico who ran Ja nus Twenty took care to spread his holdings around His successor Scott S choelzel has suffered losses lately he is down percent yeartodate b ut thats after a total gain of percent in the preceding five years b ut they have not been nearly so catastrophic and for good reason Schoel zels last report lists among his top holdings three tech stocks two fi nancials one drug company one energy firm whoops Enron again one indu strial one consumerdurables company and one services firm For investors in individual stocks the important question is this How muc h diversification is enough Some risk is inherent in even the broadest por tfolio This is called market or systematic risk Over the past year s market risk as measured in standard deviation has been about percen t In other words in twothirds of the years the annual return of the SP has fallen into a band ranging from points lower to points higher tha n its average return of percent that is between a loss of percent an d a gain of percent Thats still volatile but if you invest in stocks you have to live with it What you dont have to live with is anything more volatile So your objecti ve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo id what is called idiosyncratic or extra risk A portfolio with just a few stocks or one like McCalls that is overloaded in a single sector ha s lots of idiosyncratic risk In an influential study found that inve stors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just stocks in a wide variety of sectors in fact owning eight or stocks depressed risk sharply Recently however the market has appeared to be far more volatile and a n ew study by a group of economists headed by John Campbell of Harvard found that many more stocks were needed around to bring a portfolio down to the same level of riskiness as the broad market What Campbells group found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become more volatile in the s but that stocks within those sectors had so yo u need to own more of them But owning stocks is a pain in the neck and it brings up the Buffett Lynch admonitions about too much diversification It is hard just to take t he time to make the selections but even buyandhold investors need to kee p track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management pr oduct failures or new competition not to mention Enronstyle accounting sh enanigans signs that its time to sell One good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun ds and stocks For example you might want to put percent of the money y ou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the SP itself like Va nguard Index which charges rockbottom expenses and guarantees that ri sk wont exceed systematic levels You could also consider a broad fund tha ts managed by human beings such as Meridian Value or Baron Growth which are recommended by Sheldon Jacobs editor of the NoLoad Fund Investor news letter Then another percent of your holdings can go into a few sector f unds that specialize in technology real estate energy and smallcaps and the final percent into a portfolio of to individual stocks I ow n at last count There are many valid variations Just dont emulate Mark Twain In a letter to clients recently Anthony M Maramarco of David L Babson Co the Cambridge Mass investment firm recalled the aphorism of Twain s Puddnhead Wilson Put all your eggs in the one basket and watch tha t basket Unfortunately such a philosophy emphatically does not work in s tock investing as Twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fort une into the Paige Linotype a machine that flopped We all make mistakes It was Twain after all who pointed out that human beings are the only animals that blush or need to But smart

jobs after inflating profits may offer some satisfaction to retirees and employees at the troubled energy marketer But dont bank on it When corporate insiders can sell the company and stroll away with millions while workers and other stockholders are left with peanuts it would be har d not to be bitter As Oregonian business writer Jeff Manning reported Friday local employees of Portland General Electric an Enron subsidiary watched their retirement savings sink after Enron announced on Oct that it would lose mill ion in the fourth quarter This came after Enron officers made more than million selling stocks earlier in the year Then on Nov Enron dropped the other shoe It admitted it had overstated earnings for four years by million or percent Over those few wee ks Enron shares plunged from to its close on Friday The fouryear overstatement developed through some novel accounting methods Enron and its auditor Arthur Anderson insist that its financial reports were all within proper standards but the mechanics in this case included obscuring debt by placing it on the ledgers of other entities so that the p arent companys profit picture appeared rosier than it actually was The weeks from midOctober to early November were wrenching for employees Because the company was changing its fund manager they were powerless to m ake any changes in their k plans PGE chief executive

dealing to reeling The legacy of the late s stock market bubble remains with us as does irrationality THE LONG VIEW BARRY RILEY Optimism is back Stock markets around the globe have typically rallied by per cent since rock bottom was reached on September Only per cent of global fund managers believe equities will be lower in months accord ing to a Merrill Lynch survey published this week But the legacy of the late s stock market bubble remains with us The c hallenge is how to minimise the level of irrationality Two of the UKs big gest losers from crazy prices reported on Tuesday Vodafone suffered bn of writedowns but curiously made no provisions against the skyhigh bn it paid for thirdgeneration mobile phone licences in Such payments argued Sir Christopher Gent Vodafones chief executive we re merely what the market demanded at the time It is interesting to note too that Paul Klemperer the Oxford professor who is an expert in auction theory and advised the British government has defended the disastrous ou tcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital markets view of G s prospects The common theme here is that it is nobodys fault if crazy pr ices are paid because they are legitimised by the stock market Marconi which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g iant has written off most of the bn paid for US internet hardware comp anies in There has also been a great deal of controversy in the US du ring the past few weeks over the nearcollapse of Enron the power group be ing rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival Dynegy There was an o bvious failure by investors and by stock market analysts to assess the true risks at Enron Smart businessmen will sellat mad prices but why on earth should they buy The trouble is too many academics have developed theories of value based on rational expectations The real world is unfortunately very different Some of the distortions had obvious technical origins The Vodafone bubble of reflected the crossborder takeover of Mannesmann and the artificia l weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as Vodafone ball ooned in market capitalisation to reach at one stage per cent of the F TSE Index The market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen tals but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting at which point they were safe in terms of risk against the index benchmar k That was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low freefl oat new issues internet companies especially were floated off with only per cent of the stock made available although anything up to per ce nt went into the indices creating serious shortages and bubble valuations Changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p roblem but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm ent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stocks Takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality and indeed this is an area where academics recognise the problem over many years they have point ed out that all the benefits of deals and often more than all accrue to t he shareholders of the companies taken over while investors in the bidding companies suffer dilution Investors know this and in normal market condi tions news of a takeover will depress the bidders share price But in a bu bble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria as well as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities of new equity Also it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market is high than when it is low Two years ago companies such as Marconi were engaged in buying sprees at daft prices Now when prices are much lower h ardly any acquisitions are being made and investment banks are dismissing thousands of employees An exception to the deal famine is gold mining wh ich just happens to have been one of the stock markets strongest sectors t his year Another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks Over recent years their earningspershare forecasts for the next calendar year have been on average per cent too high This has not just been a mistake they have been paid to be overoptimistic Admittedly attempts are being made to restructure the incentives here as the embarrassed investment ban ks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors of judgment during the bull market but it remains to be seen whether much will really change The mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts and indeed many professional investors do not That Merrill survey incidentally sho ws that fund managers on average expect no more than per cent earnings pe r share growth over the next year while the stockbrokers analysts are sti ll clinging to the hope that it will be per cent A final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their ex ecutives the wrong sort of incentives The ruin of Marconi may appear irrat ional when multibillionpound acquisitions are being declared worthless a fter only two years But executives with lucrative stock option plans whic h pay off if their gambles go right combined with golden goodbye and pensi on packages that are triggered if things go wrong may well consider it per fectly rational from their viewpoint to take much bigger risks than other shareholders or employees would consider acceptable Moreover Sir Christopher Gent shareholders of Vodafone will remember rec eived a controversial m personal bonus last year for clinching the Manne smann takeover a deal that requires bn of writeoffs In normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rati onal but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window Many i nvestors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly That is why many people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of win ning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration

WILL wonders never cease Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on the table Mark McGwire the homerunhitting baseball player for St Louis retired And he let it be known that he never signed a twoyear million contrac t his agent negotiated last spring Why Because he wanted to find out if h is injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before It didnt and he decided he wasnt worth that kind of money Then Ken Lay chairman of Enron Corp said he wont take the million he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when En ron is sold to Dynegy Corp Of course neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback r etirement plan sacking groceries at the supermarket carrying them to the car and hoping for a big tip Still it was a class act on both their part s McGwire only hit last season well below his lifetime average And Lay Well lets say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has a company sunk as fast as Enron Remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of a share Now it s hovering in the singledigit level and Enron is being forced to sell its elf to a smaller rival The stock price incentive How did Enron get into this position Put the blame on the companys relent less drive to push up its stock price And a big reason for that push comes from the way American companies compensate top executives In the last couple of decades executive compensation has soared The avera ge chief executive officer today makes times as much in salary bonuses and stock options as the average factory worker Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really arent relev ant Most of the money top executives receive doesnt come from base pay or bonuses but from stock options Such options usually work this way Executives are given hundreds or thousa nds of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future date The sales price can be anything from cents to the price of the sto ck on the date the options were granted If the stock increases past the ex ercise price in the option the executive can buy the stock and then sell i t making big bucks It the stock has dropped below the option price its underwater in the jargon then those options are worthless Granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareh olders those who favor this sort of incentive say And thats true if you talking about inandout traders But its not true if were looking out f or the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term Keeping the debt hidden Keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down Enron To hype the stock Enrons execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel it s amazing growth and some of its dicier investments in partnerships Enron was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals That way it could m ove a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership That in turn made the companys earnings look better When Enrons executives finally fessed up they had to write down their pro fits over the past few years by percent But the real irony here is that percent is still a heck of a lot of money But by that time the majori ty of shareholders simply had no faith in Enrons bookkeeping Now look at Lays compensation In he exercised stock options and made million on them In sales of options brought him million a nd this year about million according to a study published by Bloomberg News Was Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitab le I dont think so He was simply following the latest fad in corporate g overnance He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders The shareholders were happy with that high stock price Nobody besides so me stock analysts complained about Enrons often impenetrable bookkeepin g until that stock price started to fall Would Enrons bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fe wer stock options Maybe Fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys And no one would want that job if he were only going to make million a year instead of million Just kidding Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights

Bullish and Patient on Energy Stocks By JAN M ROSEN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company DESPITE last weeks plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big o il companies some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the longterm p rospects for energy stocks These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities said Tina Vital an oil and gas analyst at Standard Poors who recommends a broad group of integrated oil companies including Exxon Mobil ChevronTexaco R oyal DutchShell BP and TotalFinaElf They have excellent management a top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors she said provided that investors are patient and can bear shortterm swings Last weeks price declines were set off by Russian oil companies refusal t o accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries f or big production cuts They were a reminder that the sector is extremely v olatile Oil could go to a barrel short term she said but there i s no certainty of that The oil producers could reach an agreement by Janua ry sending prices upward Over the long term she expects to see productio n cuts Demand for energy has grown only percent this year and prices have bee n declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline as drivers hav e seen at the gas pump West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at on the New York Mercantile Exchange up cents from its Thursday close the lowest since June But an economic recovery expected by late could cause demand to pick up analysts say As oil prices have dropped so have the prices of most oil stocks but not as much as the overall market since the beginning of Over that period the S P energy index has lost percent while the S P stock in dex is down percent A report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept terrorist attacks had intensified the countrys economic slowdown t hey are not expected to result in any longterm volatility in energy market s The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise perc ent a year through instead of the percent predicted only a year a go Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks WHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term L Bruce Lanni s enior oil analyst at A G Edwards Sons in New York said that any potent ial price war was likely to be fairly shortlived because neither OPEC nor nonOPEC countries could withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period of time and prices should rebound sharply as a result back up in the lower to mid range Low prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term but Mr Lanni too sees value in the stocks His top pick is Conoco now trading at his month target is We remain confident he said that the companys annual oil and gas p roduction should grow by about percent on average over the next several years Conocos debt at percent of capital is relatively high but he expects the companys strong cash flow it equaled a share last year to reduce the debt level to percent next year and to percent in T he companys aftertax interest cost is only percent he said Mr Lanni also favors KerrMcGee a natural gas exploration and production company and BP calling both undervalued He regards Exxon Mobil Royal Du tchShell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced so he is not recommending buyi ng them now If you own them hold them he said William Featherston executive director and an oil and gas exploration anal yst at UBS Warburg said he felt nearterm caution but mediumterm optimi sm for sustainably higher natural gas prices He said he would encourage investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies over the next two months His top picks are Apache KerrMcGee and EOG Res ources Such stocks are highly volatile he said They are tradingoriented vehic les and shortterm volatility in commodity prices generally provides the m ost attractive entry and exit points he said While natural gas prices declined throughout most of this year prices rose at a startling pace fr om per million cubic feet at the end of September to over per mill ion cubic feet within weeks He cited three reasons for the price rally a decline in gas surpluses pre dictions of a colderthannormal winter and what he has called pathetic t hirdquarter natural gas production despite record drilling activity The tangled finances of the Enron Corporation were also a factor in the rec ent price increase for natural gas futures he said Enron which marketed billion cubic feet a day of natural gas or more than percent of the nations demand is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Comm ission and announced a billion reduction in shareholder equity from de als with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer It also reported a thirdquarter loss and restated earlier earnings Enron has agr eed to be taken over by Dynegy a smaller rival for about billion in st ock Dynegy is also assuming about billion in debt Anxiety over whether the Enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or ha ve other market repercussions led to an increase in prices While it is d ifficult to quantify the Enron factor Mr Featherston said the shortte rm effects on natural gas prices seem to be over OTHER factors of course could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors over the next several months The status of the war against terrorism Pre sident Bushs decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve thus helpin g OPEC in reducing excess global capacity and a United Nations review of t he foodforoil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a signi ficant impact on battered oil prices Nevertheless Ms Vital said for the long term energy will probably be in short supply and new sources must be developed So she also likes the pro

Aquila Energy Corp is one of several energy traders limiting its trading with Enron Corp in case Dynegy Inc pulls out of its bid for the company the Financial Times said citing Aquila Aquila said it began making contingency plans in case Dynegy withdrew from its billion takeover of Enron the paper reported Enron the largest energy trader decided to sell after its shares plunged this year and a federal investigation of accounting irregularities limited its ability to finance operations Enrons collapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets where the company does onequarter of all gas and power trades Dynegys agreement to buy Enron allows it to withdraw from the transaction under certain circumstances the FT said PERSPECTIVES A tale of greed and hubris Waldo Proffitt Sarasota HeraldTribune All F Copyright For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of public utilities the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly of relying on unregulated profit driven enterprises to supply our energy A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street the poster boy for the uti lity industry its stock selling for about a share Last week its stock was worth about percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought by a competitor There was fear the companys bond rating might fall to th e junk level What happened It will take months if not years to untangle the details but it is clear that the main culprit was greed closely followed by hubris Not too many years ago Enron was a small struggling gas pipeline company in Houston As deregulation spread to more and more states Enron began acq uiring pipelines gas producers and utilities It also acquired friends in high places especially the Bush family and the ir key political advisers And it discovered it could make money faster by selling and trading energy than by producing it Enron sold many of its ge nerating plants and became the biggest power broker in the nation Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked Ca lifornia consumers of tens of billions of dollars Enron was one of the fir st power barons to take advantage of Californias flawed deregulation law virtually written by instate and outof state utility companies The California fiasco soured probably most Americans on utility deregulat ion but Enron was not singled out for calumny and management saw no reaso n to examine its business ethics Contrarywise management had visions of even greater profits which it felt no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders The chief financial off icer and other highranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary part nerships which made deals with Enron I do not understand the details of th ese arrangements but neither do independent accountants the Securities an d Exchange Commission or congressional investigators It does seem clear th at the Enron insiders made millions for themselves Enron acknowledges without explaining that stockholder equity dropped billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overs tated profits by some million Whether this was by design or by mistak e is in dispute but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the c onfidence of investors So much for greed Back to hubris It seems not unlikely that Enrons leade rs felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of cornercutting be cause they had friends in high places The chief executive Kenneth L Lay was and is a personal friend of George W Bush and has easy access to the White House For many months after the new administration took office Karl Rove Bushs top political strategist owned Enron stock valued at to and sold it only after h e had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gain s tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest Lawrence Lindsey the presidents chief economic coordinator and I Lewis Libby V ice President Cheneys chief of staff owned stock in Enron and Lindsey wa s paid last year as a consultant for Enron Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bushs four political campaigns one unsuccessful for Congress two for governor and one for president In Enron and its employees gave to Bushs campai gn to the Republican National Committee and to the Pres idential Inauguration Committee Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy key subCabinet appointments administration action or inaction in the California energy mess and the o verall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favo rable to the interests of Enron And now a couple of questions Is it possible the unusual financial maneuve rs by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilme n in the Bush administration Were those of them with heavy investments in Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company Was Enron right in thin king its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to reprimand Or in light of our preoccupation with terrorism will the Enron case get m uch attention from the federal government Or from voters Waldo Proffitt is the former editor of the HeraldTribune Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Business Financial Desk MARKET BEAT Counting Blessings Along With the Losses TOM PETRUNO TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition C Copyright The Times Mirror Company Try finishing this sentence The best thing about my experience as an inve stor in was Many Americans contemplating the losses theyve suffered this year in the stock market might say there was nothing best about what happened to the min fact nothing good at all perhaps other than that it might have been worse With share prices on the rise again the damage to portfolios has been less ened Even so stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks to keep this from being the markets worst calendar year since The bluechip Standard Poors index rose last week but its sti ll down year to date Yet those losses while certainly not trivial especially when theyre your s can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this years experiences With investing adversity can be a more important teacher than success If youre having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful about anything investmentrelated try these on for size Asset allocation is no longer just a quaint theory The paramount inves ting rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk But i t took the worst stock bear market in years to bring this lesson home fo r many people who thought equities only rose in value Now millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much they can lose in stocksand how bonds and shortterm cash savings can off set market losses and preserve capital It has been a hard lesson to be sure But investors who take asset allocat ion to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in the long run And dont underestimate what that can mean for your peace of mind long term The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned In the late s many economists lamented how the US savings rate continued to shrink Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be rising nonstop In other words many Americans were letting the stock market do their savin g for them when share prices were rising or more each year Now with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns on stocks in this decade its clear that many people will have to find a way to save regularly if theyre going to meet their longterm financial go als especially retirement This may not be a pleasant reality but its better for most people to have faced this fact sooner rather than later while there may be time to make up lost ground A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and thos e who tout them The markets slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street analysts money managers and others whose knowledge understanding and jud gment were clearly lacking in retrospect Investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present the mselves as experts is a highly dangerous strategy if it can be called a strategy at all Sure it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the mo on and nobody had much use for reviewing a companys fundamentals But that wasnt investingit was speculating and on a massive and ultimately rui nous scale People have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the mar ket and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their por tfolios in the long run Just ask anyone who shifted their entire k retirement savings sum into aggressivegrowth mutual funds in the first quarter of right before the market peakedbecause of the bullish comments of some yearold tech stock analyst Those investors arent likely to make a move like that agai n Freemarket forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies Capi talism may be harsh but its efficient when the good times end and its ti me to find out which companies truly have talent and staying powerand des erve more capital Hundreds of dotcoms have failed but who really misses them Is it any har der to find what you want on the Internet It probably would have been much worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors funds for another year instead of failing when they did But the market isnt just eliminating small companies that never had much o f a future The financial nearcollapse of energy giant Enron Corp exposed a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefitto the point that the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to should not be relied upon Also to be weeded out though over a longer time period will be mutual fun d managers whose performance running other peoples money has been a nightm are for those investorsmeaning the returns produced have been far worse than what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that par ticular sector These managers know who they areand hopefully their shareholders know b y now as well and will vote with their feet The free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control p rices Once again the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has lost its ability to prop up crude oil prices which have sunk to twoyear lows amid the weak global economy Thats lousy for OPEC but its great for every en ergy consumer The markets woes have altered many investors priorities for the better The wild bull market of the late s demanded peoples attention and go t it For some stocks became an obsession Their portfolios dominated their live s especially if they were actively trading shares They believed they were going to be rich or richer and that it was all because of how smart they were Now most people have been humbled by the market In the process some have realized that they dont want their mood determined by their portfolios d aytodate price changes The Sept terrorist attacks of course also changed many peoples view of what truly matters to them Money is

Reserved Warren Buffett who was probably the greatest investor of the th century is fond of quoting the salacious actress Mae West as saying Too much of a good thing can be wonderful In the market such a motto would lead you to avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks y ou really really like Peter Lynch who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the th cent ury calls spreading yourself too thin diworseification Smart witty and brilliant at picking stocks Buffett and Lynch may not nee d diversification but the rest of us do When you own one stock youre ou t on a limb For example very few analysts with or without a conflict o f interest predicted that shares of Enron the energy and trading compan y would tumble by percent in a year Put all your eggs in a basket like that and you end up with a gooey mess The more stocks you own as long as they are in different industries the more the overall riskiness of yo ur portfolio is modulated The reason you dont want a superrisky portfolio is simple While Warren B uffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the valu e of his holdings most investors are not A portfolio that increases in pr ice by percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year rises by t hreequarters the second and rises by percent the third But reasonable investors prefer the consistent ride It prevents them from doing something stupid such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money dur ing that first disastrous year Consider the sad case of James D McCall who earlier this month resigned a s manager of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty mutual fund Two years ago Mer rill wanted McCalls services so desperately that the firm went to court to pry McCall away from his previous employer Pilgrim Baxter where he rang up impressive gains in the late s His big success was called PBHG Lar ge Cap And when they got McCall Merrills brokers raised more than billion from their clients for him to invest While the average growths tock mutual fund owns about stocks with the top holdings representi ng about onefourth of the portfolios total value McCall specialized in w hat are called concentrated portfolios In the case of Merrill Lynch Focu s Twenty he owned as the name implies just stocks At last report hi s top holdings accounted for a whopping twothirds of the funds assets If McCall had spread his stocks among say a dozen different industries he might have smoothed his ride Instead percent of his assets went t o technology firms The Focus fund and a smaller one that McCall ran called Premier Growth were launched in March Within just months all but million of the clients original billion had vanished It is hard to imagine losing as much as Focus Twenty did even if you tried As of Nov the week McCall resigned the fund was down percent for t he year compared with a loss of percent for the Standard Poors s tock index the benchmark for fund managers According to the latest report from Morningstar Mutual Funds of McCalls stocks had declined durin g the only exception being HarleyDavidson More amazing of the losers had fallen by at least half By the way Enron was McCalls seven thlargest holding This fund has had a wretched existence wrote Morningstar analyst Kunal K apoor who did admit a grudging admiration for McCalls perseverance McCal ls faith may turn out to be well placed over time Kapoor said Unfortun ately time ran out My point here is not to pick on McCall but to reveal the perils of concentr ation Buying Focus Twenty as a technology fund and consigning it to no mo re than onefifth of your holdings with the rest of your assets in diversi fied conventional stocks or funds might have made sense but Focus Twenty was touted as a longterm capital appreciation fund not a sector fund Here it failed but maybe it didnt have to The manager who made the concentrated fund popular Tom Marsico who ran Ja nus Twenty took care to spread his holdings around His successor Scott S choelzel has suffered losses lately he is down percent yeartodate b ut thats after a total gain of percent in the preceding five years b ut they have not been nearly so catastrophic and for good reason Schoel zels last report lists among his top holdings three tech stocks two fi nancials one drug company one energy firm whoops Enron again one indu strial one consumerdurables company and one services firm For investors in individual stocks the important question is this How muc h diversification is enough Some risk is inherent in even the broadest por tfolio This is called market or systematic risk Over the past year s market risk as measured in standard deviation has been about percen t In other words in twothirds of the years the annual return of the SP has fallen into a band ranging from points lower to points higher tha n its average return of percent that is between a loss of percent an d a gain of percent Thats still volatile but if you invest in stocks you have to live with it What you dont have to live with is anything more volatile So your objecti ve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo id what is called idiosyncratic or extra risk A portfolio with just a few stocks or one like McCalls that is overloaded in a single sector ha s lots of idiosyncratic risk In an influential study found that inve stors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just stocks in a wide variety of sectors in fact owning eight or stocks depressed risk sharply Recently however the market has appeared to be far more volatile and a n ew study by a group of economists headed by John Campbell of Harvard found that many more stocks were needed around to bring a portfolio down to the same level of riskiness as the broad market What Campbells group found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become more volatile in the s but that stocks within those sectors had so yo u need to own more of them But owning stocks is a pain in the neck and it brings up the Buffett Lynch admonitions about too much diversification It is hard just to take t he time to make the selections but even buyandhold investors need to kee p track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management pr oduct failures or new competition not to mention Enronstyle accounting sh enanigans signs that its time to sell One good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun ds and stocks For example you might want to put percent of the money y ou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the SP itself like Va nguard Index which charges rockbottom expenses and guarantees that ri sk wont exceed systematic levels You could also consider a broad fund tha ts managed by human beings such as Meridian Value or Baron Growth which are recommended by Sheldon Jacobs editor of the NoLoad Fund Investor news letter Then another percent of your holdings can go into a few sector f unds that specialize in technology real estate energy and smallcaps and the final percent into a portfolio of to individual stocks I ow n at last count There are many valid variations Just dont emulate Mark Twain In a letter to clients recently Anthony M Maramarco of David L Babson Co the Cambridge Mass investment firm recalled the aphorism of Twain s Puddnhead Wilson Put all your eggs in the one basket and watch tha t basket Unfortunately such a philosophy emphatically does not work in s tock investing as Twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fort une into the Paige Linotype a machine that flopped We all make mistakes It was Twain after all who pointed out that

Workers ire over k plans is understandable Watching Enrons bigwigs lose their jobs after inflating profits may offer some satisfaction to retirees and employees at the troubled energy marketer But dont bank on it When corporate insiders can sell the company and stroll away with millions while workers and other stockholders are left with peanuts it would be har d not to be bitter As Oregonian business writer Jeff Manning reported Friday local employees of Portland General Electric an Enron subsidiary watched their retirement savings sink after Enron announced on Oct that it would lose mill ion in the fourth quarter This came after Enron officers made more than million selling stocks earlier in the year Then on Nov Enron dropped the other shoe It admitted it had overstated earnings for four years by million or percent Over those few wee ks Enron shares plunged from to its close on Friday The fouryear overstatement developed through some novel accounting methods Enron and its auditor Arthur Anderson insist that its financial reports were all within proper standards but the mechanics in this case included obscuring debt by placing it on the ledgers of other entities so that the p arent companys profit picture appeared rosier than it actually was The weeks from midOctober to early November were wrenching for employees Because the company was changing its fund manager they were powerless to m ake any changes in their k plans PGE chief executive Peggy Fowler poi nts out that the change in k plan managers was announced last summer And although employees could have gotten out of Enron stocks over the histo ry of the plan Enron seemed to be an attractive investment Company executives though were selling Jeffrey Skilling who was promote d to Enron chief executive early in the year but resigned in August sold m ore than million in company shares according to transaction records cove ring the first half of the year Former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow who was fired last month in an action related to the financial mess made million in stock sales be tweeen March and November of last year Kenneth Lay Enrons chief executiv e who returned after his protege Skilling left made at least million in stock sales from late last year He has announced that he would decline his severance package Dynegy another Texas energy marketing company has made a bid to buy Enron That probably means the best Enron and PGE employees can hope for now is that Dynegy will be a better corporate owner or they can try their luck wi th one of the many shareholder lawsuits being filed The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enrons activities If its behavior was illegal there will be consequences for company office rs Thats still not much to offer to workers

Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved FINANCE WEEK From dealing to reeling The legacy of the late s stock market bubble remains with us as does irrationality THE LONG VIEW BARRY RILEY Optimism is back Stock markets around the globe have typically rallied by per cent since rock bottom was reached on September Only per cent of global fund managers believe equities will be lower in months accord ing to a Merrill Lynch survey published this week But the legacy of the late s stock market bubble remains with us The c hallenge is how to minimise the level of irrationality Two of the UKs big gest losers from crazy prices reported on Tuesday Vodafone suffered bn of writedowns but curiously made no provisions against the skyhigh bn it paid for thirdgeneration mobile phone licences in Such payments argued Sir Christopher Gent Vodafones chief executive we re merely what the market demanded at the time It is interesting to note too that Paul Klemperer the Oxford professor who is an expert in auction theory and advised the British government has defended the disastrous ou tcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital markets view of G s prospects The common theme here is that it is nobodys fault if crazy pr ices are paid because they are legitimised by the stock market Marconi which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g iant has written off most of the bn paid for US internet hardware comp anies in There has also been a great deal of controversy in the US du ring the past few weeks over the nearcollapse of Enron the power group be ing rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival Dynegy There was an o bvious failure by investors and by stock market analysts to assess the true risks at Enron Smart businessmen will sellat mad prices but why on earth should they buy The trouble is too many academics have developed theories of value based on rational expectations The real world is unfortunately very different Some of the distortions had obvious technical origins The Vodafone bubble of reflected the crossborder takeover of Mannesmann and the artificia l weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as Vodafone ball ooned in market capitalisation to reach at one stage per cent of the F TSE Index The market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen tals but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting at which point they were safe in terms of risk against the index benchmar k That was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low freefl oat new issues internet companies especially were floated off with only per cent of the stock made available although anything up to per ce nt went into the indices creating serious shortages and bubble valuations Changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p roblem but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm ent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stocks Takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality and indeed this is an area where academics recognise the problem over many years they have point ed out that all the benefits of deals and often more than all accrue to t he shareholders of the companies taken over while investors in the bidding companies suffer dilution Investors know this and in normal market condi tions news of a takeover will depress the bidders share price But in a bu bble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria as well as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities of new equity Also it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market is high than when it is low Two years ago companies such as Marconi were engaged in buying sprees at daft prices Now when prices are much lower h ardly any acquisitions are being made and investment banks are dismissing thousands of employees An exception to the deal famine is gold mining wh ich just happens to have been one of the stock markets strongest sectors t his year Another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks Over recent years their earningspershare forecasts for the next calendar year have been on average per cent too high This has not just been a mistake they have been paid to be overoptimistic Admittedly attempts are being made to restructure the incentives here as the embarrassed investment ban ks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors of judgment during the bull market but it remains to be seen whether much will really change The mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts and indeed many professional investors do not That Merrill survey incidentally sho ws that fund managers on average expect no more than per cent earnings pe r share growth over the next year while the stockbrokers analysts are sti ll clinging to the hope that it will be per cent A final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their ex ecutives the wrong sort of incentives The ruin of Marconi may appear irrat ional when multibillionpound acquisitions are being declared worthless a fter only two years But executives with lucrative stock option plans whic h pay off if their gambles go right combined with golden goodbye and pensi on packages that are triggered if things go wrong may well consider it per fectly rational from their viewpoint to take much bigger risks than other shareholders or employees would consider acceptable Moreover Sir Christopher Gent shareholders of Vodafone will remember rec eived a controversial m personal bonus last year for clinching the Manne smann takeover a deal that requires bn of writeoffs In normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rati onal but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window Many i nvestors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly That is why many people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of win ning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration c Copyright Financial Times Ltd All rights reserved Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved WORLD STOCK MARKETS Bears take

criticisms of the practice after Lay mentioned during a conference call last month that dealings with two partnerships had reduced Enrons shareholder equity or its assets minus liabilities by billion

assets said company spokesman Mark Palmer One of the assets includes CEG Rio a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash Enron has set up a number of

Rights Reserved Senior Wall Street bankers are concerned that Dynegy could walk away from its proposed bn bn rescue bid for its rival energy group Enron a move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and financial markets In a series of interviews with the Financial Times bankers expressed worries that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely difficult for Dynegy to pull out some of the companys shareholders were under the impression that the material adverse change clause could be triggered There is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen or even likely to happen one banker said And the knock on effects of it not going ahead are not good he added None of the bankers would agree to be publicly identified The possibility of Dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior bankers from JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup which are advising Enron met with officials from Moodys the credit rating agencies days ago The rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for Dynegy to give up its bid further undermining Enrons creditworthiness Moodys decision to preserve Enrons investment grade rating was one of the main reasons why Dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid In justifying the allstock bid Chuck Watson chairman of Dynegy said last week that buying the company for a low price a fraction of Enrons market capitalisation at its peak in was a major protection against failure But he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with Moodys had been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the merger agreement were not too loose According to Dynegy the material adverse change clauses relate to the outcome of a Securities and Exchange

pay off a million note by Nov if it doesnt find collateral to guarantee the debt The revelations came in the embattled energy traders Q document which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet Enron delayed releasing the Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm Andersen because of an ongoing

the filing mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years billion owed by Osprey Trust and million by Marlin Water Trust Enron is under a negative review by most rating agencies but a cash infusion from Dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible million to billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat The turmoil around Enrons finances started after Oct when steep losses in its thirdquarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approval of the companys board of directors The LJM partnerships were formed using Enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the companys new lines of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the companys stock The CFOs dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past years by nearly million Those problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in Enron which led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating The company eventually reached a deal with rival Dynegy to be acquired for almost billion in stock plus the assumption of almost billion in debt and billion in preferred stock The fallout from Enrons crumble is spreading to its major service

FLOYD NORRIS The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company The Enron Corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash It said that if any of a number of things went wrong its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question In a delayed quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission the company said that it would have to repay million in debt by next Tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan Enron has about billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of billion by the end of next year The report for the third quarter which was filed five days late says the company faces immediate demand for billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further Enrons independent auditors with the firm of Arthur Andersen have not been able to complete their review of Enrons financial statements for the third quarter Andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of Enrons books related to Enrons disclosure this month that it had overstated almost million in profits in the last five years Enron has said that it will restate statements that Andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon Yesterday Representative John D Dingell of Michigan the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee called for an investigation into Arthur Andersens handling of the Enron audits A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night Enron the nations largest energy trader has agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc its smaller crosstown rival in Houston and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of Enron which is now at the lowest investmentgrade rating Any downgrades could lead to a collapse of Enrons core energy trading business analysts say as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with Enron entirely The Dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year and the disclosures yesterday indicate that Enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed Enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next September Enron is in talks to obtain million to billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions In addition executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell million in assets by the end of the year and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year Enron is also set to receive a billion infusion from ChevronTexaco which owns a percent stake in Dynegy if the deal closes next year Still even after factoring in cash flow from Enrons core energytrading operations Enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year meaning that Enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities Carol Coale an analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston said the new disclosures indicated that Enrons troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with Dynegy was announced Our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank Ms Coale said But now it sounds like Enrons problems were actually more inherent than perceived Enrons deal with Dynegy calls for Enron holders to receive Dynegy share for each Enron share but in trading since the deal was announced Enrons share price has lagged Dynegys price reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday before the Enron filing was released Enron rose cents to and Dynegy rose to At those prices the value of the Dynegy offer is percent above Enrons share price compared with a percent difference when the deal was announced Some debts that Enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further And the merger agreement with Dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if Enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger currently an Enron share In afterhours trading yesterday after the release of the Enron filing the share price slipped to Enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than million Yesterdays filing provided some additional details on Enrons relationships with various related partnerships whose debts Enron could be forced to pay and it said that additional writeoffs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined It said that because Enrons stock value had fallen one writedown could be million The disclosures show that Enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet But the collapse of Enrons stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost Enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts It is not possible to predict Enron warned investors whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a

IMPACT There are mounting fears about the fate of the Enron URL Dynegy URL deal Financial Times once again has a scoop Robert Thomson is the US Managing Editor of the FT joining us now with details Robert whats going on I thought this was suppose to be a done deal ROBERT THOMSON FINANCIAL TIMES US MANAGING EDITOR Well thats right Kathleen but the interesting thing that make it perhaps not so done a deal is what we might call the materially adverse clause That there is a change in the conditions surrounding Enron that makes INAUDIBLE a downgrade of them possible and really leaves the financial institutions exposed to them And these financial institutions in conversations interviews with the Financial Times are telling us that they have deeper fears about this materially adverse clause being enacted than people out there now realize HAYS Well I must say I think this is very interesting and Im surprised not that Im an expert on the deal or even close to the deal itself but it seemed that part of the way that Enron was getting the deal done with Dynegy was to say look we dug up all the possible problems all the maybe kind of hidden not so great deals that are being investigated now and supposedly everything was on the table So what what do you think What are you hearing that theyre finding now that makes things look worst than they already look THOMSON Well really thats the issue To be quite honest we dont know but who would have known a month ago and particularly three months ago that Enron is in this situation that its now in and how far those problems stretch is really the issue that INAUDIBLE surrounding Enron still have it and that they suspect that Dynegy might have it It looks quite more INAUDIBLE the deal Now Dynegy is saying but were going ahead with this yes there is that clause there yes it covers us in case we find something that we dont like the look of or like the smell of depending on what it maybe but we dont feel it will have to activate it But of course on the other hand they are going to say that but they do have that fall back clause if they need it HAYS Go ahead Robert Im sorry THOMSON So but the truth is you know the full extent of Enrons exposure to various businesses really is hidden by the complexity of the transactions the company was engaging in markets where frankly very few people know a lot about it HAYS What happens if the deal falls through What happen to Enron THOMSON Well theres a real issue there that a downgrade may follow and this theres certainly concern in the banking community Again that the level of exposure in counter party risk and so on to Enron isnt fully comprehended and frankly thats why they spoke to the Financial Times because they thought well theres an impression that this is a done deal that the Enron problem is solved Theyre saying actually not so HAYS Wow Well I think we have just enough time to take a look at youre you got us something in China again You take us to that world part of the world frequently whats going on there THOMSON Yeah we Beijing INAUDIBLE here Essentially the IFC the International Finance Corporation arm of the World Bank is taking a large stake in Chinese Bank in Nanjing ph That is amazing really Its by far the largest stake million percent in the Nanjingph City Bank and its really we here are going to be the first of three big investments in Chinese banks over the next year or so There are two small ones there already where people have taken percent in Chinese banks but for the first time International institutions are in a position where they can think about Chinese retail banking in a serious way HAYS OK Robert well thank you very much I guess thats something for investors to watch Particularly people who are global investors

Enron Reduces Earnings Warns Mln Payment Due Update New York Enron Reduces Earnings Warns Mln Payment Due Update Adds in first paragraph that note payment may come next week Houston Nov Bloomberg Enron Corp which agreed to a takeover by Dynegy Inc after a financial crisis threatened it with bankruptcy revised thirdquarter earnings for the second time this month and said it may have to make early payment of a million note next week The Houstonbased company lowered results by cents a share bringing its thirdquarter loss to cents or million according to a Securities Exchange Commission filing Liabilities from an affiliated partnership may reduce fourth quarter earnings by million before taxes Enron said The disclosures dont indicate that Enron is in much worse shape than on Nov said John Olson an energy analyst at Sanders Morris Harris Thats when Enron lowered its earnings back to by million reflecting losses by affiliated partnerships that it had wrongly kept off the books I dont think anyone would be particularly surprised that they had to adjust thirdquarter earnings again considering they restated earnings for the last four years said Olson who doesnt own shares of Dynegy or Enron I dont think its a problem Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing partnership may cut Enrons fourthquarter earnings Enron is obligated to back Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock Because Enrons stock has plunged it may have to write down its assets by million the filing said Partnership Problems Enron said that the Dynegy buyout could collapse if Enron is forced to pay judgments of more than billion to settle lawsuits over its dealings with affiliated partnerships Dynegy has said it can cancel the transaction if Enrons litigation costs and other liabilities grow to billion or more Enron faces at least such lawsuits Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and take debt off its books Its shares plunged by percent this year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were being used to hide losses from failed investments Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said earlier this month that buying back million shares from two such partnerships cost Enron shareholders billion in lost equity The company wrote off billion in investments in water telecommunications and retailenergy sales in the third quarter A drop in Enrons senior unsecured debt rating to BBB by Standard Poors on Nov may force Enron to pay off the million note by Nov if it doesnt find collateral to guarantee the debt taken on by another affiliated partnership the company said Brazilian Liability Without repayment or collateral investors in a partnership that owns Brazilian naturalgas assets can begin to liquidate the partnerships assets Enron said Enron said its working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt If we cant talk lenders into refinancing there is the possibility that note would be due next week said Karen Denne an Enron spokeswoman As of Friday the company had billion in cash on hand It expects to close on million in additional financing tomorrow and to complete million in asset sales by the end of the year Its also trying to find investors who will put million to billion into the company The company has raised cash in recent weeks by using its pipelines as collateral It received billion from ChevronTexaco last week as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement In return Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline Dynegy can acquire the pipeline even if the merger falls through Enron closed on a million loan from JP Morgan Chase Co and Salomon Smith Barney Inc on Wednesday that was secured with assets of Enrons Transwestern Pipeline Co It expects to close on another million loan secured with other Northern Natural Gas assets this week Denne said The commitment for the loans was announced Nov Billion Liability The company also has huge liabilities that could push it into financial crisis before the merger closes A further drop in its debt rating which would put it below investment grade would trigger repayment of billion in debt owed by two other affiliated companies Enron said The rating drop would force it to repay billion in debt owed by Osprey Trust and million in debt taken on by Marlin Water Trust the company said in the filing Arthur Andersen LLP Enrons auditor didnt grant final approval of its financial statements in the filing because of an internal investigation of its dealings with affiliated partnerships Enron said The SEC is also investigating the partnerships which were run by Enron executives The filing was released after the stock market closed Shares of Enron

problems at peripheral businesses but the energy giant still has a way to go to make Wall Street happy analysts said Wednesday Enron North Americas biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on Tuesday The company took billion in charges and writedowns on illfated investments measures Enron executives said credit rating agencies were comfortable with UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said on Wednesday he was not thrilled by the announcement during a conference call to discuss thirdquarter earnings And for good reason Moodys Investors Service subsequently issued a statement saying it had placed all of Enrons longterm debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade There appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved Barone said The writedowns on poorly performing assets and a more detailed breakdown of the companys operations went some way to appeasing Wall Street after a tumultuous year in which Enrons stock lost about twothirds of its value but analysts said they were not about to let Enron off the hook just yet Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters said he remained concerned about Enrons quality of earnings and cash flow Winters said he believed Enron would have liked to take even bigger charges and

boosting New England power supply By Scott DiSavino Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW YORK Oct Reuters Energy companies said the future development of new power plants and transmission lines in the US Northeast hinges in part on setting up a Northeast Regional Transmission Organization RTO RTOs are predominantly forprofit groups established to bring all of a regions highvoltage transmission lines under central control while ensuring equal access to the lines to all power suppliers seeking to market their goods across the grid The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC which oversees the interstate wholesale power market believes RTOs will benefit consumers by enhancing competition among power providers in turn improving service and driving down rates If FERC can drive the Northeast RTO to closure in a reasonable period of time it will accelerate the development of new transmission and generation Enron Corps managing director of global government affairs Rick Shapiro told Reuters Houstonbased Enron is the nations top energy marketer How and when the RTO gets implemented will radically impact the market Its crucial to the development of the market in New England Mirant Corp spokesman Ray Long told Reuters Energy provider Mirant of Atlanta has megawatts MW of generation in New England The company is currently adding another MW to its Canal station in Massachusetts Once we get the permits for Canal we will reassess whether to proceed with the project A big part of that assessment will depend on the RTO process Long said THE NORTHEAST RTO FERC wants to see four superregional RTOs created in the US in the Northeast Midwest Southeast and West Several regions have taken long strides toward developing RTOs including a notforprofit model proposed in the Midwest and rival forprofit plans vying for FERC approval in the West FERC Chairman Patrick Wood seeking to spur the development of RTOs favors giving utilities until Dec to join one or forfeit their right to sell electricity in the wholesale market though the commission has not voted on this plan The Northeast RTO will include New England New York the PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland PJM region and possibly parts of eastern Canada FERC said it wants the Northeast RTO to be built on the PJM market platform and to include the best practices of the New England and New York markets PJM Interconnection which operates the power grid in parts of Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland Delaware Virginia and Washington DC is the nations only fully functioning RTO The process FERC set in place to establish one RTO in PJM New York and New England is going to get us where we need to be in terms of having a vibrant wholesale market Long said Long said Mirant determined a single Northeast RTO would save more than million annually by eliminating the artificial borders that now exist between New York New England and PJM An administrative law judge acting as a mediator for FERC considered three proposals for creating the Northeast RTO The three plans were proposed by interested parties including Mirant and Enron and the regions grid operators the New York Independent System Operator ISO in New York ISO New England in New England and PJM Last month the judge asked the FERC to decide who will govern the Northeast RTO and what the timetable is to put the plan in place The judge favored a plan put forward by the New York ISO and ISO New England If FERC implements the RTO plan proposed by PJM in consumers could save billion million a year over the New YorkNew England plan which would not be implemented until Long said Under the PJM plan PJM would overlay its current market model across the entire region while adopting some of the best practices of the other markets Although nothing is perfect PJM is widely accepted as the best market in the region New York and New England which are younger markets are still works in progress with some bugs to work out Enrons Shapiro said Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Enron Seeks Replacement For AGAs Gas Storage Report Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc HOUSTON Dow Jones Enron Corp ENE the nations largest natural gas trading company isnt ready to let the regular report on US natural gas storage inventory die a company executive said Tuesday Because the American Gas Association has said it will discontinue its weekly gas storage report at the end of the year Enron would like to see another organization take over the report said John Lavorato president and chief executive of the companys Americas Wholesale Services unit Speaking at a meeting with analysts Lavorato said the storage report is important for the gas industry to keep track of industry fundamentals Without a regular report on storage gas inventory the gas industry can expect less frequent but greater price changes than seen in the past he said The Department of Energys Energy Information Administration publishes monthly data on gas storage but the information isnt as timely as data the AGA reports each Wednesday The EIA issued its latest gas storage report Oct It showed the amount of gas in storage at the end of July The data comes from reports filed by operators of gas storage facilities It also showed estimates of the amount of gas in storage at the end of August and September Those estimates are generated by a computer model Wednesdays weekly storage report from the AGA will show estimated inventory as of Oct The AGA estimate is based on reports from gas storage facilities That data is then run through an AGA computer model to generate the report Lavorato said he would like to see the EIA the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America or consultants like PIRA Energy Group an international energy consulting firm take over reports on storage inventory INGAA is an industry trade group representing gas pipeline companies in the US Canada and Mexico They manage many of the gas storage facilities Lavorato would like to see a new report based on data that could be audited he said He said he thinks the AGA has found itself in the middle of something it didnt want to be in Originally intended for use within the gas industry the weekly AGA report has become highprofile and is even watched by equity markets he said Some industry participants have criticized the AGA report wondering whether it can be manipulated by companies that supply data to the AGA Many of those companies also trade physical gas and gas futures When the

considering changes to wholesale price caps on electricity in California and Western states which power producers hope will allow them to charge more when supplies in the region are tight The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission plans a public conference Oct to discuss altering the pricing formula The commission established caps in April and June after skyrocketing electricity costs led to insolvency for Californias largest utilities units of PGE Corp and Edison International We have heard and understand that people do think the solution was very Californiacentric and it was FERC Chairman Pat Wood said indicating changes in the formula are likely But Californias needs were very urgent at the time While commissioners declined to say what they would be willing to change about the pricing formula they want to fine tune the caps before the winter which is the peak period of demand and may yet cause another jump in prices Wood said Changes could be made next month The current pricing formula is based on the mostexpensive power generated in California Enron Corp Sierra Pacific Resources and other sellers of power to California want the formula to consider costs from all generators in the region Enron blamed the formula for a July blackout in Nevada when sellers withheld supply because local prices were too low based on the highest cost of supply then being offered in California Lower Power Costs Though the cost of wholesale power in California has dropped since the commission ordered the first emergency cap on April Wood said the Western states may face another shortage of power and high prices this winter The Pacific Northwest depends on hydropower for much of its energy needs and rainfall has been below normal this year Part of the shortfall in power last year and early this year was the result of a drought that reduced power available from dams I remain concerned about that part of the country Wood said It has not been raining a whole lot out there The average price for a megawatthour at the California Oregon border in September was down from in April A megawatthour is enough electricity to power about average California homes for an hour On the agenda for this months conference is a proposal to link the formula to the price of natural gas a fuel used in many generating plants Im not predisposed for or against specific changes said FERC Commissioner Nora Brownell The Oct conference will help the commission determine aspects of the price control that the parties involved agree are working and those that are not she said Surcharge In a related matter the commission also may halt the percent surcharge it permits generators to charge in California to cover the costs of collecting bad debt The insolvent California utilities now have plans to pay off their debts For power sellers in the West the current price caps often require utilities to sell their excess power at a loss Enron Sierra Pacific and other marketers said in statements to the commission They said the price they sometimes pay for power is higher than the cost of supply from the mostexpensive producer in California The determination of the proxy price should not be limited to California generators Enron said in a government filing It should be determined by the leastefficient generator in the entire West Power marketers also should be allowed to

investors who want to book a tax loss on beatendown stocks the wash sale rule can be a hurdle because it essentially prevents taxpayers from selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring

candidates In addition the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w ashsale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an inthemoney pu t because there is a strong likelihood

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp Dynegy Inc is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult ibilliondollar deal The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energytrading comp any the nations biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas During t he past month Enron has taken a billion writeoff of assets revised do wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a billion redu ction in shareholder equity The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn erships run by some of its own executives under investigation by the Secu rities and Exchange Commission In an SEC filing Monday Enron disclosed hu ndreds of millions of potential additional writeoffs as well as the possib ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t han billion in loans by the end of the year As of pm Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Enron shares fell or to each after having dropped Tuesday In excess of million shares traded Wednesday more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock Enrons bonds also again traded sharpl y lower market observers said The turmoil spilled over to Dynegys stock which also was among the most a ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange As of pm Wednesday Dyne gy shares fell to each On Wednesday Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi ve Chuck Watson said his company was working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement though it continued to perform due diligence on Enr on Under the merger agreement Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enrons financial and legal problems become severe e nough However some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so called material adverse change clauses They point to a decision earlier th is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc to c omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc even though Tyson a Springdale Ark foodproducts company had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in IBPs earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit Dynegy officials didnt return calls seeking comment To complete the deal twothirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou ld have to give their approval No dates for those votes have been set One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr on contained information Dynegy hadnt known about Dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i nformation as part of the companys due diligence this person said It cou ldnt be determined what the new information was The merger agreement announced Nov calls for Dynegy to exchange share for each of Enrons roughly million fully diluted shares giving the purchase a value of about billion at Dynegys current stock price However from a price standpoint the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy On the day of the merger announcement Enron shares were trading at about each or about of the purchase price under the exchange ratio As of Wednesday Enrons market price was only about of the mergerformula price Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme nt when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra ding relatively close to the offering price Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger In itially many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houstonbased Dynegy Dynegy and Enron officia ls have predicted that the merger supposed to be completed late next year would significantly and immediately increase Dynegys earnings Now analysts are challenging that assumption Ron Barone managing director at UBS Warburg LLC said he believes that because of Enrons financial pro blems a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself Mr Barone said he thinks a likely scenario is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about Dynegy share for each Enron share Such a ratcheting down wouldnt be without precedent in the deal According to one person familiar with the merger negotiations Dynegy reduced the ex change formula at least once prior to the Nov announcement because of En rons rapidly sinking stock price which at the beginning of this year was above a share In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street Go ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy A longtime Enron fan Mr Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha t the merger would help Dynegys earnings and whether Enron could recover the significant business that has been lost in its giant energytrading op erations The Enron machine continues to sputter Mr Fleischer wrote Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren egotiate the terms significantly Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcyl aw filing Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba nkers and customers an Enron bankruptcycourt filing is highly possible said Ralph Pellecchia a senior director at Fitch a creditratings agency On Wednesday Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not ch above noninvestmentgrade or junk status But Fitch also said it bel ieved Enrons trading partners had made significant cash collateral calls in recent days that are well in excess of previous expectations contrib uting to liquidity pressures Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir m of Weil Gotshal Manges which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate workout situations Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing an Enron spok eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor e doesnt expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger Since the m erger announcement Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them Enron sa id it made some progress improving its financial position The company said it reached a final agreement with units of JP Morgan Chase Co and Cit igroup Inc on the remaining million of a previously announced bill ion in secured credit lines Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym ent of an existing million note to midDecember from next week The sp okeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet ed next month so that repayment

price collapsed Enron which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc Houston becaus e of mounting financial problems has seen its stock price fall to on Wednesday from a peak of nearly a share last year The decline has bee n costly to participants in Enrons retirement plan because more than o f the k assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year according to one of the suits The first suit was filed Nov on behalf of plan participants by Campbell Harrison Wright LLP a Houston law firm and the second was filed Tuesda y by Seattlebased Hagens Berman LLP Both seek classaction

The companys stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it had extensive offbalancesheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed by former company officials The Securities and Exchange Commission has la unched a formal investigation into the companys accounting and Enron has said it will restate years of financial information The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c ompanies over losses in the companystock portion of their k plans Th e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu ing to offer company stock even after they became aware of serious busines s problems that would hurt the stock price All the suits are pending As with most of these companies Enron matches employee contributions to th e

allowed to offer their own stock i n retirement plans and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto ck Enron doesnt let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat ching contributions to the k plan until age However plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes ts of the participants which includes choosing prudent investments Genera lly to prove that the plans administrators breached their fiduciary dutie s employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen t This presents a high hurdle so it is not surprising that prior

Reserved BusinessFinancial Desk Section C From Sunbeam to Enron Andersens Reputation Suffers By FLOYD NORRIS The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen the accounting firm that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem ent case Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar thur Andersen in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from the companys reported profits in recent years All of which raises the question Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee p of the accounting industry It is not an easy question to answer and not everyone is willing to rush t o judgment If you want to attack Andersen for Enron you need to know mo re than we know Arthur Levitt the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said this week But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases it is materiality In all three cases Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea d Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into trouble The idea is that it doesnt much matter if a few little things we re gotten wrong But they can add up At Enron however they did not add up to that much a total of milli on over four years The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated It is not cle ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time To those who treasure the role of auditors the humiliation of Andersen is painful Back in the s it was Leonard Spacek Andersens managing par tner who warned that the professions existence is in peril because it was not showing enough independence His public prodding was crucial in ma king the industry do a better job Two decades ago when the issue on the t able was pension accounting Andersen was the only major accounting firm to break with clients and push for good rules Now Andersens backbone is open to question It was evidence that senior pe ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that led the SEC to bring that suit which the firm chose to settle without a dmitting it had done anything wrong The partner that the SEC says looke d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations and Andersen says h e acted properly Lynn Turner who was chief accountant of the SEC at the time and is now director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un iversity says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap pened to Coopers Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s eries of highly publicized blown audits We got bludgeoned to death in the press he said People did not even want to see us at their doorsteps It was brutal but we deserved it We h ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending clients and not enough to good accounting For Andersen to avoid that fate its relatively new chief executive Joseph Berardino who declined to be interviewed for this column will need to se t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the backbone that Mr Spacek epitomized And then he will have to convince the public of that Copyright Dow

Column c New York Times Company When William B Harrison Jr speaks of last years billion merger of J P Morgan and the Chase Manhattan Corporation he speaks proudly of a deal that he considers to be a capstone to his year career of helping build a giant of the banking business This is the first merger Ive been part of said Mr Harrison the chie f executive of the combined bank where I feel our core business is compl ete The ChaseJ P Morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investm ent banking elite just as Mr Harrison intended But with Wall Street and the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was put together the many mergers stock sales and other moneymaking opportun ities that were supposed to justify the highpriced acquisition have largel y dried up for now Consequently deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already spec ulating that Mr Harrison may ultimately be compelled to do yet anothe r large deal this time to diversify his business away from its heavy empha sis on Wall Street J P Morgan Chase has won some prominent assignments like handling the re vampings of troubled giants like Lucent and more recently Enron the bele aguered energy trading company But while J P Morgan Chase is proud of serving alongside Citigroup as bot h lead lender and adviser to Enron on its acquisition by Dynegy the dual r ole it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank Wit h Enrons shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidde n debts J P Morgan Chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with Dynegy on track Thanks largely to the slump on Wall Street J P Morgan Chases profits fe ll by twothirds in the third quarter to million from billion in the period a year ago Its stock has dropped percent this year more th an other banks shares The banks stock is ahead of investment banks like Goldman Sachs with which J P Morgan Chase increasingly competes The jury is still out in many respects on this merger said Judah Kraus haar an analyst at Merrill Lynch Nevertheless he likes J P Morgan Chas es stock he said because expectations are very low All J P Morgan Chases competitors are suffering from the slowdown on Wal l Street But some like Citigroup are better diversified and have greater involvement in oldfashioned consumer banking which is proving to be a st rong moneymaker this year Nearly a third of J P Morgan Chases revenues are consumeroriented By c ontrast its chief New York rival Citigroup gets half its revenues from c onsumer businesses The timing of the merger was bad said Steven Wharton a banking analys t at Loomis Sayles Company which owns about a million J P Morgan Chas e shares Theres no disputing that Actually Mr Harrison disputes it I cant tell you how happy I am about having done this merger he said in a recent interview While there ar e pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment we have a much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time In Mr Harrisons favor is his battletested team of top executives who hav e worked together for a decade or more Few executives remain in the top sp ots from the old J P Morgan Instead most major posts are filled by mana gers who have worked with Mr Harrison since his days at Chemical Bank whe re he spent most of his career Mr Harrisons team successfully gobbled up Manufacturers Hanover Bank in then followed that with Chemicals mer ger with Chase Manhattan in before incorporating Morgan into the fold last year The group of Chemical veterans includes Marc J Shapiro who oversees finan ce and risk management at J P Morgan Chase Donald H Layton one of two leaders of investment banking and James B Lee Jr the banks senior deal maker The team also includes Dina Dublon the banks chief financial offi cer Two other senior executives have also lived through big deals Geoffrey T Boisi the other investment banking leader was the onetime investment ban king chief at Goldman Sachs David A Coulter in charge of Chases retail bank had been chief executive of Bank of America before it was bought by NationsBank There arent many teams that have gone through as many mergers as Bill Ha rrison and his team said Mark G Solow managing principal at GarMark Ad visors an investment firm and a former senior executive at Chemical Still Ms Dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the J P Morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations In general mergers are very hard on morale she said There is no qu estion that this one has a tougher emotional toll The banks executives are making the best of a bad situation They have tak en advantage of the slowdown to cut around percent of the combined banks staff or about more employees than anticipated at the time the merg er was announced Many of these job cuts were aimed at highcost investment bankers J P Mo rgan Chase expects that jobs in its investment banking division will have been eliminated by the end of the year We have focused on the tougher jobs to cut Ms Dublon said In some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for J P Morgan Chase to overhaul its staff With fewer jobs available on Wall Street Mr Shapiro said the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain a bout changes in their jobs People have fewer options he said so yo u have a little more control over the process Thanks partly to these cuts the bank estimates the saving from cost cuttin g will be billion annually compared with an original projection of billion at the time of the merger The cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits in the banks core businesses What we can control and are managing very aggressively is the expenses of the company Ms Dublon said in a confer ence call with reporters on Oct the day earnings were announced Aside from cost cuts the weakness on Wall Street makes it hard for the ban ks executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking where fees were down percent in the third quarter But Mr Harrison points to mark etshare gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on Wall Street He hopes that when the investment banking business revives J P M organ Chase will hold on to these gains The bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas mergers and ac quisitions and the underwriting of large investmentgrade bond deals The bank ranked th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising on mergers during the first nine months of up from Chases thplac e finish and J P Morgans thplace standing during the same period last year according to Thomson Financial Securities data The merger and acquisitions business which Chase had been slowly building for years is stronger following the merger with J P Morgan said Mr Lee a vice chairman at the bank As a result the bank is able to win assignm ents providing advice to customers who dealt with the old Chase only for lo ans Mr Lee remains proud of the banks work with Enron the energy company de spite its troubles J P Morgan Chase along with Citigroup raised bil lion in bank financing for Enron earlier this month It was also hired to a dvise the company which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken ove r by Dynegy The old Chase long a lending powerhouse would have had a good shot at lea ding the bank financing but an advisory role would have been less certain Mr Lee said the investment banker advising Enron came from the old J P Morgan But with merger activity slow there are few such deals to go aroun d The bank is also proud of its strength in longterm investmentgrade bonds another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger It moved up to second place in that area so far this year compared with s ixth place a year ago The bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings a surge driven by todays low interest rates In May J P Morgan Chase rais ed billion in bonds for WorldCom the telecommunications company in th e largest corporate debt deal in the United States on record Unfortunately for J P Morgan Chase the fees for underwriting investment grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offe rings of stock where J P Morgan Chase remains a secondtier competitor The bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of sto ck falling to th place this year compared with the old J P Morgans t hplace finish a year ago Chase was th Mr Harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock of ferings to build momentum slowly in that business We think we have a cha nce in the second half of this year to be in the top five he said Given the slowdown some bankers predict that Mr Harrison will ultimately do another deal either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolst er weak areas in investment banking like the equity division The general view is that the combination with J P Morgan didnt do enou gh one investment banker said Mr Harrison disagrees I dont feel he said we need to do another

Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones Heres one outlook that couldnt have been more wrong Around this time last year pundits and fund managers were touting the per fect storm of market forces that were coming together to make the energy t rading business one to watch in Then came the California power crisis and allegations of pricegouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group That wa s followed by renewed volatility in power prices and this time the prices were headed down not up And then came a crushing blow against trading firms the unraveling of the industrys largest player Enron Corp ENE Simply put the perfect storm stalled and a business once buoyed by high g as prices strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth sto cks than utilities are instead mired at around ninetimes earnings about where traditional utilities trade And the chance for recovery in Basu Mullick portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund is w illing to bet there is He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same pricetoearnings multiple as the broader markets median which is current ly between to times future earnings he said Its just a matter of time before the stocks get there They were just recovering from Gray Davis Mullick said referring to the governor of California who had accused outofstate energy traders of a rtificially inflating the price of power in the state and triggering the s tates energy crisis Now they are recovering from Enron The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates he sai d I dont think they should get the same valuation as a gardenvariety ut ility Still others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions bet ween the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies strategie s and financial disclosures Enrons precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accoun ting issues Although many of Enrons financial problems arent solely the fault of marktomarket accounting issues there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatilit y it can create Answers Elude Investors Investors are asking hard questions and not always getting the answers the y want Using marktomarket methods a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position whether its a contract an option a swap etc at the time even if the value of the position is realized over a longer pe riod The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes fr om the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its o riginal assessment Also sometimes it isnt easy to calculate the fair val ue of the commodity position This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isnt liquid Over time companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their m arktomarket gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterpa rts that provide little or no disclosure said ABN AMRO Inc analyst Paul P atterson Encouragingly it appears companies may already be responding to the call f or added disclosure According to a survey Patterson conducted more compan ies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their marktomarket accounting practices during thirdquarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cashbased All things being equal we believe reported earnings that more closely ref lect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with t hem than earnings that do not he said He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between ear nings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by marktomarket accounting At the end of the day it is not a matter of simply producing profits but being able to say where those earnings came from said one investor who ma nages a pension fund Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce Tim OBrien portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund said energy m erchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positi ons should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditi onal utility companies Still the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity p rices Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc DYN Duke Energy C orp DUK and Dominion Resources Inc D According to OBrien the group never deserved to have the pricetoearning s multiples above to times earnings which were once paid for the st ocks We all got sucked up by the upleg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclic al these companies are OBrien said adding that the average multiple sho uld be in the high singledigits to the highteens As for independent power producers which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market the group may wind up being valued on the basis o f the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio according to OBr ien One analogy is that they are basically like commercial realestate plays OBrien said That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp CPN which is already in the lowerhalf of its trading range

limited to Nymex members with dedicated phone systems The exchange had been planning to expand use of Access but ended up doing so sooner than it had expected On Sept it started offering Access tra

Nymexs building located near where th e trade towers stood was shut down for several days after the attacks Exp anding its already existent Access system to the Internet helped ease poten tial liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading hours after Nymex reopened Development of the eNymex system began last year under the direction of for mer Nymex Chairman Daniel

systems frontend technology and caused the delays But he still ex pected eNymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original prod uct line If Nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as eNyme x with Access the new system may end up being known as eNymex eNymex right now is looking for a new mission said an industry source cl ose to Nymex You know how politics works We dont scrap it we just rena me it Anything we do electronically is now going to be called eNymex But the original deal and concept that Rappaport initiated is done Nymexs reconsideration comes

billion plus about billion in assumed debt and preferred stock A month later Enron announced it had agreed to be acquired by Houstonbase d Dynegy Weve been watching this from afar to see how it could impact that sale P ortland Generals acquisition by Northwest Natural Gas said Roy Hemmingw ay chairman of the Oregon Public Utility Commission We have authority if that sale doesnt go through to rule on whether Dyneg y can take over Enron he said Ratings agency Fitch last week cut Portland Generals debt ratings due to uncertainty at its parent Enron Wednesday the same agency said a bankrup tcy filing by Enron was highly possible if the proposed rescue by Dynegy collapses We havent seen any credit problems so far and Portland General isnt in the market buying power for its customers right now in a big way Hemmin gway said However he noted that If they really were unable to conduct their busine ss because they were not creditworthy we would have to use whatever instrum ents are available to make sure service to customers is maintained Earlie r this year California was forced to take over buying power for the PGE u nit of Pacific Gas Electric and Edison International subsidiary Southern California Edison after the two utilities saw their credit ratings cut to j unk status Federal regulators have insisted the sellers of wholesale power have the ri ght to sell to a creditworthy buyer Californias largest utility Pacific Gas Electric chose to file for ban kruptcy because of its mounting debt In a parallel consumer advocates fea r the fate of the biggest utility in neighboring Oregon could end up in the hands of a bankruptcy judge Hemmingway said the Oregon Public Utility Commission recently had granted P ortland General a rate increase and the utility has plenty of cash flow cu rrently to handle its obligations This is nothing like California where that was not the case he said Northwest Natural Gas which is also based in Portland has set a target of filing next Wednesday with the Oregon commission to take over the utility spokesman Steve Sechrist said We have no concerns whatsoever at this point The deal is moving forward a nd there is no reason we can see why it should not he said noting the del ay to the filing was the result of the complexities of the acquisition Jason Eisdorfer a lawyer for the Citizens Utility Board of Oregon said m ajor questions would be raised if Enron went under before the deal were com pleted Would the bankruptcy judge let the terms of the agreement go forward I dont know There is a risk that Portland General

company remains optimistic for the potential of the merger Enron agreed Nov to the takeover now valued at about billion in stock and assumed debt after a financial crisis threatened it with bankruptcy On Wednesday Enron got a threeweek reprieve from lenders on a million note due next week giving the company more time to restructure its finances Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he

reported yesterday citing unidentified executives close to the companies Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company is seeking million to billion Enron needs to raise billion to billion in cash within the next days said Sean Egan managing director of EganJones Rating Co Their trading operation has burned through cash faster than the market had expected Egan said Trading Business Traders

Are Among Likely Enron Investors Analyst Says Houston Nov Bloomberg Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Co the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group are among the likely candidates to be approached by Enron Corp for a private equity investment to shore up the companys balance sheet said industry analyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentralNet The firms have cash on hand and have invested in energy companies in the past An investment in Enron may look attractive now that its shares have plunged by percent this year Many of the larger more traditional buyout firms would find this deal attractive said Snow This is a company that has real assets that is down in the dumps and has need of capital when capital is scarce Enrons bankers met recently with leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies to seek an investment the New York Times reported citing executives close to the companies Enrons stock fell for a fifth day in six on concern the companys weakened financial condition may lead Dynegy Inc to try to cancel or rework its planned purchase of the rival Houston company Investors may inject as much as billion under arrangements that would protect them from further declines in Enrons stock the Times said The new investments would be in Enrons Transwestern Pipeline which connects naturalgas fields in Texas to the California market the newspaper said JP Morgan Chase Co and Citigroup Inc agreed to terms that give each of them a million equity stake as part of a transaction to be completed Monday officials told the newspaper Buyout firms sometimes make collective bids pooling their money and distributing the risk The firms also like to invest in industries that are out of favor with public investors and to do so in partnership with corporate investors like Dynegy said Snow You need to know enough about the energy business to know whether its a good deal and then you need to be confident in the Dynegy team he said KKR KKR the secondbiggest private equity firm with billion in assets declined comment on Enron through spokeswoman Molly Morse of Kekst Co The New Yorkbased firm invested more than billion in DPL Inc a utility in Dayton Ohio and will receive million of that back from the company after DPL sold million of bonds in August KKR very much gets involved in deals where theres a corporate partner and they dont have a majority stake Snow said They would possibly hold it for years because they like slow exits KKR is also a possible candidate because it recently raised a new billion buyout fund Any LBO firm would need assurance about how it will get its money back on an Enron investment said Snow The thing they have to be cautious about is the exit he said If theres a chance Dynegy would agree to buy out the LBO firms stake over time that would give some confidence But if the only exit is the public market thats a little bit dicier Any private investment also must be large enough to make a meaningful difference Enrons market value is billion and Dynegy has proposed paying billion in stock and assumption of debt That means the private equity portion would have to approach billion or more The largest private equity firms have assets of more than billion under management each according to Asset Alternatives a Wellesley Massachusetts industry research firm Still many of those firms dont have enough free capital to undertake an investment of million or more An announcement of an investment may come soon analysts say Energy trading firms such as Mirant Corp and Aquila Inc are doing fewer trades with Enron because of concern that the company wont be able to finance its business Enron shares have fallen by almost half in the past three sessions Theyre going to need this investment within to days said Sean Egan of EganJones Ratings

Slowed by Enron Suit Redmond Washington Nov Bloomberg Microsoft Corps plans to expand its MSN highspeed Internet service have been delayed by a lawsuit from Enron Corp which could cost the company customers during the holiday season analysts said MSN had planned to have fast Internet access over telephone lines available with help from energy trader Enron in markets starting Oct Instead the service is now on sale in about markets said MSN Product Manager Lisa Gurry The latest delay follows a string of apparent bad luck that has delayed the rollout of Microsofts fast Internet access service over the last year The holidays are typically a popular time for customers to buy socalled broadband access often along with new personal computers purchased or received as gifts They have a track record of picking broadband partners that dont quite work out said Joe Laszlo senior analyst at market researcher Jupiter Media Metrix Inc It definitely hurts them with customers who want broadband right now Subscribers to fast Internet access services are expected to grow fourfold by according to estimates by Jupiter Media Metrix while sales of slower Internet access plans decline Fast Internet service over phone lines uses digital subscriber line or DSL technology On Track Gurry said Redmond Washingtonbased Microsoft is still on track to have fast access for sale by the end of March to percent of the million to million households that have DSL available in their neighborhoods There is very little growth left in the dialup access space for Microsoft or anybody which leaves them with broadband as the only potential growth area for the MSN access business said Youssef Squali an analyst at FACEquities who rates Microsoft Internet competitor AOL Time Warner Inc a buy Microsoft also wants to deliver consumer services like music and video and software updates which require fast Internet access for smooth downloads The company originally began a service with NorthPoint Communications Group Inc a nowbankrupt provider of fast Web access Microsoft has also had difficulty finding partners among cable companies who use their networks for highspeed service Now Houstonbased Enron which agreed in June to provide the backbone for a nationwide expansion of MSNs service is suing Enron claimed in its lawsuit that it isnt required to deliver broadband services if Microsoft hasnt first provided a billing and ordering system that the biggest software company agreed to build Enron which is being acquired by rival Dynegy Inc recently disclosed debts of billion due by and restated earnings for four years Slower Expansion MSN has been selling highspeed access in states under partnership with Qwest Communications International Inc for the last few months MSN has begun the planned service expansion outside of those states by working with Enron competitors that MSN Marketing Director Bob Visse declined to name The company is also talking to Enron he said Enron didnt return calls for comment Because of the Enron suit the expansion is moving slower than expected Visse said Since Oct MSN has added service in Los Angeles San Francisco San Diego and Sacramento California and Houston Dallas San Antonio and Austin Texas giving Microsoft a total of about markets rather than Plans to expand marketing are also on hold Visse said It is very unfortunate that we are in the position we are in said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer Top US Internet service provider America Online owned by AOL Time Warner Inc has also been slow to get into the high speed market analysts said That doesnt mean Microsoft is in the clear Laszlo said both MSN and AOL might pay for their sluggishness with tougher competition from thirdplace EarthLink Inc and from cable and telephone companies that have more experience selling highspeed Internet access America Online has more than million subscribers to MSNs million EarthLink Inc has million subscribers Laszlo doesnt think MSN or America Online can build the kind of lead in the highspeed market that America Online has in the slower dial up access market Not a Permanent Blow Not that anyone need worry about Microsoft MSN will be able to expand its fast Internet access business even with the delays Laszlo said They are already late in the broadband market so this means they get a little later he said But broadband will continue to grow over the next few years and this is definitely not a permanent blow Analysts also say Microsoft still needs to find a cable partner that will let MSN use its network to sell fast access over cable lines Cable is more popular than DSL with customers looking for fast Web service The five largest cable providers control percent of the US highspeed Internet market The five largest sellers of access via phone lines and DSL technology account for about percent according to market researcher ARS Inc Microsoft MSN Vice President Yusuf Mehdi said last month the company

half what Dynegy has offered to pay analysts and investors are paying close attention to the circumstances under which Dynegy could ba rgain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal Earlier this month Houstonbased Dynegy offered to buy its far larger cros stown rival in an allstock deal that currently values Enron shares at apiece or a total of about billion But in the wake of postagree ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan tially less than expected the companys stock has been hammered In pm trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday Enron shares fell cen ts to The stock is down so far this year and far short of the pe rshare takeover price Dynegy shares rose cents to Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under the terms negotiated Dynegy does appear to have other options The agreem ent with Enron contains a broad material adverse change clause as well as some specific trigger points that could be invoked Dynegy officials performed due diligence throughout the holiday weekend seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron which has suffe red a series of damaging blows Since midOctober Enron has disclosed that some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved assets off Enrons balance sheet for a time to several private partnersh ips Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio n investigation Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an accounting error by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O ct At one point Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning s An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the deal would be completed as agreed Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walkaway provi sions are broad by design to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share holders Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen t Clauses related to a material adverse change also known as a material a dverse effect have been the focus of much attention among merger professi onals this year due in part to the stock markets fluctuations and the e conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi tions But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c onsidered extremely difficult to prove Both parties typically are reluctan t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal much the way a bride and groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins Furthermore a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t hat a buyer cant easily walk away from a merger In that case meatproces sing concern Tyson Foods Inc sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea tpacker IBP Inc due to a drop in IBPs earnings and a writedown of an IB P subsidiary But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact sa ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBPs business and the accounting issue In a lengthy June opinion Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E Strine Jr wrote that the important thing is whether the company has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat ions that is consequential to the companys earnings power over a commercia lly reasonable period which one would think would be measured in years rat her than months That interpretation has created ripples in the dealmaking community promp ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh ich deals can be terminated Since the Sept attacks for example a han dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou ld qualify as a material adverse change or MAC A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change is whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is it just a hiccup says Meredith Brown cochairman of the mergers and acq uisitions group at law firm Debevoise Plimpton in New York He adds that a court may be skeptical if Dynegy claimed that Enrons postmerger agree ment disclosures were a surprise The EnronDynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith er side to seek termination Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst antially better offer although it is prohibited from soliciting one In su ch a case it could be required to pay a million topper fee to Dyneg y and its coinvestor ChevronTexaco Inc Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces pending or threatened litigation liabilities that are reasonably likely to cost Enron billion If thos e liabilities hit billion an Enron material event will be deemed to h ave occurred presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off In s ome situations Dynegy would be liable for a million fee as well Karen Denne the Enron spokeswoman said her firm doesnt believe that loss es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e vent The liability must result from litigation Currently the company fac es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by officers and directors issuing false and misleading reports and other off enses Deal makers who arent involved in the combination say the steep drop in En rons stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldnt by itself give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it s terms Instead they say Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enrons worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event which could be di fficult in light of the companys highly publicized problems and Dynegys f requent statement that it clearly understands Enrons businesses Still th ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dyne gy to terminate the deal if any representation or warranty of Enron shall have become untrue Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto ck prices that changed an

amid a dizzying scandal over its fina nces few would have blamed Dynegy Inc CEO Charles L Watson if he had sat back and gloated After all Watson had watched as his bigger brasher cro sstown rival sniffed at Dynegys more cautious strategy all the while garn ering most of the credit for reshaping the energytrading business Instead Watson picked up the phone on Oct and called Enron Chairman C EO and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L Lay to ask how he could help Lay didnt respond immediately but as Enrons stock continued to plunge and th e company faced a cash squeeze it became clear what the only realistic ans wer could be Bail us out So two days later Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal Over muffins and a bad cup of co ffee the next day Watson recalls they sketched the outlines and by pm that night the investment bankers were called in On Nov Dynegy a nnounced that it would pay about billion plus the assumption of bi llion in debt to buy Enron which is nearly four times its size The key t o the deal was Dynegys immediate billion infusion of cash to shore up Enrons balance sheet and save its credit rating The money came from Dyne gys owner ChevronTexaco Corp Without that help Enronthe seventhlargest US company based on its billion in sales last yearmay well have faced bankruptcy Watson says that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams I dont think anybody foresaw the problems at Enron he says Its be en incredible to watch Watson has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye t If he can pull it off the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than billion and billion in assets including more than megawatts of powergenerating capacity and miles of pipeline It would control an estimated to of the energytrading market up from about now That would be sweet vindication for Watsons strategy Dynegy backs trading operations with hard assets such as power plants which allows the company to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer In contrast Enron has wo rked furiously to shed power plants and oil and gasgenerating fields bel ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel pulp and pap er IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN As Enrons stock slid below from its August high of it became a bargain that Watson couldnt pass up It woul d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a marketmaking operation to matc h Enrons Its riskmanagement systems are topoftheline Enrons commerc

falls through Dynegy will hav e the right to Enrons prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline worth an estim ated billion And Dynegy can walk away if Enrons legal liabilities e xceed billion Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence not a meltdown of its core business Indeed Enrons wholesaletrading operati on earned billion last year Says Watson We know the business We l ooked under the hood and guess what Its just as strong as we thought it was But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enrons accounting tricks The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t icking away Already the company has slashed its reported earnings since by million or of its total to account for controversial part nerships involving Enron officials The Securities Exchange Commission is still investigating We believe it will take more than just a couple of weeks and a longterm relationship between Watson and Lay to do all the n ecessary due diligence

boost provides a high margin of error he says A WANNABE Of cou rse regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations And Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures Enron is known for it s intense even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit Dynegys operations are m ore conservative some compare it to a fraternity Dynegys decision to iss ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos It s hould help too that Lay decided not to take the million golden parach ute he could have received in a buyout As it is Lay will not have a manag ement job with the new company Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe following it into online tradin g and commercial services Still Dynegys stock gains last year eclip sed Enrons rise and it rankled some that

its hide ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance Ma nagement pointed to a number of factors including a dubious decision to ex clude the results of three partnerships

gold standard has been tarnish ed The profession of auditing and accounting is in fact in crisis s ays Paul A Volcker former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board Sometimes as in the case of Enron fuzzy numbers result from questionable decisions in figuring net earnings More often though the earnings chaos results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the ir own idiosyncratic waysand an increasing willingness among investors an d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies which appear under a variet y of names from pro forma to core Enron offers its own such vers ion Before investors untangled the importance of Enrons first announcemen t its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its recurring ne t income had met expectations The resulting murk makes it difficult to answer the most basic question in investing What did my company earn Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place Because the numb ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles GAAP are woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co mpanys prospects Many institutional investors most Wall Street analysts and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant I dont know anyone wh o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything says Lehman Brothers Inc ac counting expert Robert Willens The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of noncash charges and onetime expenses While investors need to be aware of those charges they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa nce of ongoing operations Thats what operating earnings are supposed to do But because theyre calc ulated in an ad hoc manner with each company free to use its own rules co mparisons between companies have become meaningless No investorcertain ly not any ordinary investorcan read these in a way thats useful says Harvey L Pitt chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission The SEC is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and perhaps restrict use of pro formas Whats badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income In the end in vestors need two numbersa standardized operating number and an audited ne tincome numberand a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe r OUT OF HAND A widespread consensus is building to do just that In early November SP proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta llying operating earnings Only the week before the Financial Accounting S tandards Board the rulemakers for GAAP had announced that they too woul d be taking up this issue Volcker says the International Accounting Standa rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings Over the past two or three years the use of creative earnings measures h as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of hand says David M Blitzer SPs chief investment strategist Earnin gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when theyre trying to evaluate a company If people want to use an operatingearnings measure w e better all know what were looking at Without those standards in place the gap between earnings according to gen erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street is only going to grow wider and more confusing Look at the variance in ea rnings per share calculated for the SP for the third quarter Its according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson FinancialFirst Call according to SP and according to numbers reported to t he SEC under GAAP SP like BusinessWeek is owned by The McGrawHill Com panies The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong Use First Calls earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively modest priceearnings ratio of for the SP But run the numbers usin g GAAP earnings and suddenly the market has a far steeper pe of How did we get into this mess Investors and analysts have been calculating operating earnings for years and for years reasonable people could more or less agree on how to do it Then came the dotcom bubble along with inc reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn ings forecasts Suddenly companies that hadnt turned a profit by any conv entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants Th ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a llowed upstart companies to show a profit TOWER OF BABEL Pro forma fo rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within the same company casting doubt on their validity And these days the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever S Ps tallies fall between the two SPs numbers are more systematic than pr o forma but they arent followed widely enough to be a standard Investo rs are facing a Tower of Babel says Robert K Elliott former chief of t he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA and a retired KPMG partner Its not standardized and the numbers are not audited That makes it tough to evaluate a companys performance In the quarter end ed on Sept Nortel Networks Corp offered shareholders at least three e arnings numbers to choose from By conservative GAAP accounting the teleco mmunications giant lost a share The company also provided two possib le pro forma options a cents loss that excluded special charges in cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges and a still bette r cents loss that further excluded billion of incremental charges such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab les Wall Street chose the rosiest one Confusing You bet Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi ng out that theyre merely filling a void Investors are clamoring for a me asure that gives them better insight into their companys future The goal is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th ose operations There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat ing earnings says Volcker It is an effort to provide some continuity and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company Besides a s companies like to point out they still have to report GAAP earnings and investors are free to ignore everything else Theres no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the billion asset writedowns by JDS Uniphase Corp the biggest charge of the year Ne ar the height of the telecom bull market in July the San Jose Calif maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor SDL Inc for billion in stock When the deal closed in February its as sets ballooned from billion to billion But by then shares of JDS and other fiberoptics makers were collapsing To bring its acquisitions in to line with their new value the company took charges of billion Desp ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an d involved no cash paid GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net income So according to GAAP JDS lost billion in the fiscal year endi ng in Junea staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past five years added up to only billion Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash the charge off was all about the past a rightsizing of values that had gotten out of hand To analyze the companys prospects they excluded the billion ch arge The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de scribe what happened says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R Muller and well live with the consequences whatever they are Anal ysts make a similar defense My goal is to figure out what the business i s going to produce so that we can value the company says Lehman Brothers analyst Arnab Chanda GLACIAL PACE Are JDSs pro forma numbers realistic a fair gauge of JDSs ongoing operations Right now its hard for investo rs to judge And thats the kind of ambiguity SP and others would like to eliminate In November SP circulated a memo on how to standardize operati ng earnings Under the proposal operating earnings would include the costs of purchases research and development restructuring costs including sev erance writedowns from ongoing operations and the cost to the company o f stock options It would exclude mergerandacquisition expenses impairme nt of goodwill litigation settlements and the gain or loss on the sale of an asset When SP applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase it split the differe nce between Wall Street and GAAP Because of differences in what each group included in their earnings calculations the results were chaotic Using G AAP the company lost a share SP figures it lost while the c ompany put the loss at cents Meanwhile Wall Street says it made cent s The SP standard may make sense but it raises the question Where is the F inancial Accounting Standards Board the group in charge of GAAP Chairman Edmund L Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems Still investo rs shouldnt expect any improvement soon The pace of change at FASB tends to be glacial It typically takes four years to complete a new standard In for example the board realized that standards on restructuring char ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda In June the board finally issued a draft of a new standard asked fo r comments and held a public hearing In October the board said it still wasnt ready to put a fix in place Now the recession has set off an other wave of restructuring charges and the FASB still doesnt have new ru les The slow pace means the standardsetters sometimes fail to react to sudden changes in the market The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac ks on September An FASB task force unable to come up with a set of rul es for separating September costs from general expenses instead told co mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item So GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan ys general performance Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost s out in their unaudited press releases Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter Indeed is shapin g up to be one for the record books A poor economy and the devastating aft ereffects of September have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen But theres a gro wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly onetime char ges The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now while investors are braced for bad news Not only can managers sweep away yesterd ays errors but tomorrows earnings will look even better The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expensea char ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di stort the truth about a companys performance Usually big charges fall in to a few categories including charges for laying off workers and restructu ring a company charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur chased charges for investments that have lost value and charges for inven tory that has become obsolete In a recent study Harvard Business School p rofessor Mark T Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the se charges unusual That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the ir pro forma calculations Lots of critics disagree saying such charges are often an inevitable part of the business cycle and should be reflected in a companys earnings histo ry They certainly should not be ignored by investors Charges are real s hareholder wealth thats been lost argues David W Tice manager of the Prudent Bear Fund a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent thats up so f ar this year Its money they spent on something no longer worth what it was a correction of past earnings or a reserve for costs moving forward Whatever the reason its a real cost to the company and that hurts shareh olders Without standards excessive writeoffs from operating earnings c an obscure actual performance Without any rules companies calculate opera ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po ssible light Dell Computer Corp is a good example of this heads I win tails you lose school of accounting For years Dell benefited from gains in its venturecapital investments and was happy to include those gains in its reported earnings where they appeared as a separate line on the incom e statement But this year when those gains turned to losses the computer maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that million drag Dell spokesman Michael Maher says the companys press releases and SEC filings b reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma In our view the numbers are reported clearly says Maher Its all out t here for the consuming public PAST PUFFERY Many experts believe special charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated What should inve stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc Two restructuring charges in the first and third quarters minus a small extraordinary gain totaled billion or about million more than the company made in and combined Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten tial The writeoffs or the earnings Writeoffs for customer financing are another example When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to customers by million in September it effectively admitted it had boo ked sales in the past to companies that couldnt payin effect overstating its performance in those earlier periods In addition Nortel says booking sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues Tech companies blame the sharp downturn in their industry for the big writeoffs And these are nt isolated examples Peter L Bernstein publisher of newsletter Economic s Portfolio Strategy found that from to of earnings vanis hed into writeoffs Big chargeoffs can also distort future performance Critics contend that e xcess reserves are often used as a sort of cookie jar from which earnin gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Streets expectations Or c harges taken this year for example which is apt to be a lousy one for mos t companies anyway might include costs that would otherwise have been take n in future periods Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni ngs Rules for figuring operating earnings would help but this is an area that will always involve a certain amount of judgmentand therefore invite a certain amount of abuse People are going to write off everything they can in the next two quarters because theyre having a bad year anyway s ays Robert G Atkins a Mercer Management consultant Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the m off believing that with the bad news out in the open the company is poi sed for a brighter future Since Gateway detailed its thirdquarter charge of million on Oct Wall Street has bid the stock up compared with a runup for the SP Often though investors should take exactly the opposite message If for example part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training infor mationtechnology spending or research and development the cuts could dep ress future performance says Baruch Lev a professor of accounting at the Stern School of Business at New York University Are these really onetim e events he asks Or is this the beginning of an avalanche Indeed Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co strategist Steve Galbraith has found that in the year following a big chargeoff to earnings companies have underperf ormed the stock market by percentage points LA LA LAND Investors a re apt to be

expect stockmarket volatility to subside soon Still expert s say that now more than ever is the time for skittish investors to keep their wits about them In a recent interview Charles R Schwab chairman and cochief executive o f Charles Schwab Co the San Franciscobased online and discount brokera ge firm gave his views on what investors should be doing and what mista kes they should avoid Here are some excerpts from the interview In the wake of the Sept attacks how much more risk if any do you thi nk is in the financial markets Or do you think its just that peoples per ceptions about risk have changed Ive been investing since and I have to say that year after year th e risk hasnt changed The risk is always there Theres risk in investing in stocks bonds and even US Treasuries because of interestrate fluctua tions Theres risk in real estate too So the question is How do you handle it The best way is to diversify Ove r a long period of time people who diversify their investments do pretty d arned well When they dont sometimes its fatal If the only stock a n investor owned was Enron or Cisco at that was pretty fatal What do you say to people who say theyre too scared to invest right now T hat because of the threat of terrorism the anthrax scares the war in Afgh anistan the recession and so forth theres just too much uncertainty in the markets I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis we all feared the worst W e were all building bomb shelters It was a scary time This terrorist thin g is no different Its awful particularly for our children But this co untry is so wealthy in terms of its resources intellectual capital and th e strength of our government There is no more uncertainty today than in times past For example weve h ad many recessions Its not fun especially when you begin reading about a ll these layoffs In fact I think the unemployment rate now at pret ty easily might get to before it gets better And it probably wont ge

they didn t use their rational thinking They used their emotional thinking After Sept they sold at the low and fear was the driver Just a year and a half ago the driving emotion was greed Youre not

progress since their announcement in the mids By Himendra Kumar Dow Jones Newswires himendra ow jonescom Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved The Enron scandal A V Rajwade Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in ris k management It put in systems to manage risks on a realtime basis and ha d very strong management James Lam founder of eRisk a consulting firm As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of man agement of price risks I have been an admirer of Enrons elaborate disclos ure of its risk management practices And yet in a cascade of events over a period of just three weeks from midOctober it lost twothirds of its sh are value became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission SEC investigation and was taken over by a rival a third in size Latest repor ts create some doubt about whether this will go through What went wrong No the events had nothing to do with Dabhol Indeed if for us in India Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project elsew here it is likely become a case study for students of accounting finance a nd general management On second thoughts even its Indian adventures woul d make an excellent case study But first a recount of what happened After announcing on October with out much explanation or transparency that it has taken a charge of b illion against equity Enrons share price started tumbling Apparently th e charge was the result of some financial transactions and the SEC launche d an investigation The chief financial officer CFO who was directly inv olved with the transactions the companys treasurer and a couple of other senior officials were sacked Perhaps most damagingly Enron revised its accounts from onwards redu cing profits by about million and increasing debt by a somewhat simil ar amount As a result Enrons credit rating was downgraded It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas tr ading but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO These compri sed private equity and Enrons share in each of the investee companies was kept artificially below per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts To this end outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron itself should the value of the investee companyies fall below agreed th resholds All this was done to keep the losses in investments offbalance sheet and mitigate their impact on reported profits Many other US corporations inclu ding J P Morgan Chase which had large private equity investments have suf fered on this score see World Money October Enron wanted to avoid thi s and last year paid its sincedismissed CFO million for his creativ e accounting genius Incidentally those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over t he rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by th e companys auditors one of the Big Five firms which was paid million as audit fees and million for other services by Enron last year The restatement of the accounts from onwards became necessary as the E nron managementboard and the auditors were forced on review to admit tha t at least some of the transactions should have been on rather than off b alance sheet Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come o ut but what has come out is bad enough But this apart a billion dollar hit for a company of the size billi on or cash flow billion of Enron is by itself hardly a death warra nt But it turned out to be just that for Enron Perhaps because it was too arrogant Perhaps also because its accounts lack ed transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors confidence was always somewhat fragile But there are two other points worth noting the professionalism of equity analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin g and producing As for the first the professional analysts were surely aw are of the opaqueness of the accountsbut few questioned the management agg ressively on the subject Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified the spirit of the times trading assets was what the masters of the univers e did not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars The Enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal a ctivity of trading in power and gas with Skilling the former CEO claming that we are on the side of angels We are taking on the entrenched monopo lies We are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world The quotation is from an interview in BusinessWeek prior to Skillings inglorious exit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst For the analysts there was also safety in numbers Skilling claimed that Enrons operations are built around the integration of modern financial tec hnologies and physical technologies bringing derivatives theory to tradin g in power and gas Obviously the fate of Long Term Capital Management has not led to more sober management of trading risks Surely the role of markets should be to reduce the distance and cost be tween producer and consumer One does feel that there is something perverse in a society that values in terms of compensation the trader dont forg et this is just a euphemism for the speculator over the producer whether i n the bond currency or power and gas markets The markets and indeed gre ed obviously have a role to play but surely the pendulum needs to swing a little bit to the left Copyright Dow Jones Company

which totaled billion euros last year and accor ding to analysts will increase even more this year due to its acquisition of Aventis CropScience a crop protection and production company To put the demand for Cipro in context JP Morgan expects US sales of the drug to be approximately billion euros for Even emergency purchases of Cipro probably wont add that much to Bayers o verall revenues The president has asked for million for antibiotics t o combat bioterrorist attacks While its possible that sum will be increas ed not all the money would be spent on Cipro Besides its not even clear that Bayer will remain the only producer of Ci pro Though the company holds the patent for the drug theres some pressur e in Congress for the government to purchase a generic version from other m anufacturers On another front Bayer is currently battling a classaction lawsuit relate d to an anticholesterol drug implicated in a number of deaths It was forc ed to withdraw the drug from the market Bayer may offer protection against anthrax but that doesnt mean its a re fuge for investors Losses at Twice the Price You know things are bad for a company when its losses per share are double the

Partnerships Recently Run by F astow By Rebecca Smith and John R Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Enron Corp said it has been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commi ssion seeking information on the energy giants controversial dealings with partnerships that were set up and run until recently by its chief financia l officer Andrew S Fastow Following Enrons announcement yesterday morning of the SEC inquiry the co mpanys stock took another big slide falling more than in New York Sto ck Exchange trading As of pm Enron shares were trading at off knocking about billion off Enrons market capitalization Volume topped the Big Boards mostactive list at about million shares A week ago Enron stock was trading at about a share Subsequently the compa ny announced a billion thirdquarter writeoff that produced a m illion loss Analysts also voiced concerns yesterday about possible other bad news lurki ng amid Enrons vast and extremely complex operations The company has deal ings with a number of related entities Under certain circumstances if Enr ons credit rating and stock price fall far enough the company would be ob ligated to issue tens of millions of additional shares to these entities d iluting the holdings of current shareholders Enron has previously acknowledged the provisions but said its business is s trong and it feels confident that there will be no defaults In a statement Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the com pany will cooperate fully with the SEC inquiry and looks forward to th e opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest Enron h as consistently said that it believes its dealings with the Fastowrelated partnerships were proper and properly disclosed The company has said it pu t billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnershiprelated transact ions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions The SEC inquiry came from the agencys Fort Worth Texas regional office According to a person familiar with the matter this would indicate that th e inquiry comes from the SECs enforcement arm as opposed to its corporate finance section The participation of the enforcement branch would indicat e that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of securities law However enforcementbranch inquiries often dont produce any allegations of wrongdoing It also appears that the SEC hasnt yet take n the step of launching a formal investigation which would be a sign that the agency believes securities laws might have been violated The SEC decli ned to comment Certainly there have been questions and concerns about those partnership t ransactions which contributed to a billion reduction in shareholder e quity last week as part of Enrons efforts to unwind the deals Mr Fastow who has declined repeated interview requests resigned from the partnershi ps known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM CoInvestment LP in late July in the f ace of rising conflictofinterest concerns by Wall Street analysts and maj or company investors Since then internal partnership documents have shown that Mr Fastow and p erhaps a handful of Enron associates made millions of dollars last year in fees and capital increases as general partner of the LJM the larger of th e two partnerships Mr Fastows partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside Enron according to people familiar with the matter For instance these people sa y sometime after the creation of the partnerships in Enron Treasurer Jeffrey McMahon went to company president Jeffrey Skilling and complained about potential conflicts of interest posed by Mr Fastows activities Mr Skilling didnt share Mr McMahons concern these people say and Mr McM ahon requested and received reassignment to another post Mr Skilling resigned as Enron president and chief executive in midAugust citing personal reasons and the fall in Enrons stock price which peaked at about a share last year Mr McMahon and Mr Skilling havent respon ded to repeated interview requests Investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in Enrons de alings with other related entities In some cases Enron could be required to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if c ertain socalled double trigger provisions occur For example last July Enron helped create the Marlin Water Trust II which sold million in notes that are due July However Enron can be considered in default in advance of that date if its stock price falls below for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to b elow investment grade by either Moodys Investors Service or Standard Poo rs Currently Enron debt is still investmentgrade at both ratings agencies an d would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment grade category Last week Moodys put Enron on review for a possible downg rade However observers believe that even if Moodys lowers Enrons rating the company will still be investmentgrade Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved October Where Did the Value Go at Enron By FLOYD NORRIS New York Times What really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders e ver seen Wall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron newsquote redirect marketwatchredirectctxMWDcustomnytcom htmlcompanyprofileaspsymbDENE released its quarterly earnings a week ago Yesterday shares in Enron plunged to after the company said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the tran sactions The reaction was in some ways puzzling Given the questions that have been raised since the earnings announcement some of them prominently featured in The Wall Street Journal it was likely that the SEC would begin a pr eliminary inquiry Whether it will go farther than that is not clear but if nothing else the slide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confron t a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet valu e to dribble out Enrons shares rose cents to last Tuesday as investors first reacted to the earnings announcement But since then they have fallen or percent The billion reduction in shareholders equity was not mentioned in a n ews release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday It was bri efly mentioned in a conference call with analysts but many of the listener s seem to have not noticed that wrongly thinking Kenneth L Lay Enrons c hairman and chief executive was referring to a billion writeoff that w as disclosed in the earnings release When questions were asked in the following days the explanations were less than thorough Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders equity was related to the termination of structured finance vehicles involving p artnerships that had been controlled by the companys chief financial offic er Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how the company goes about its business said Ralph Pellecchia a credit anal yst at Fitch Investors Service He added that the issue of the companys c redibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its o wn Enron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its financial reports But last night it said Mr Lay would hold another confe rence call with investors at am today The companys earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many a nalysts They referred to such things as share settled costless collar arr angements and derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent natu re of existing restricted forward contracts The disclosures said the comp any entered into the transactions to hedge certain merchant investments an d other assets It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them even though the underlying assets included investments that declined in value The Wall St reet Journal citing reports the partnerships made to institutional investo rs has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash distri butions to their investors Enron officials in recent days have refused to discuss the arrangements in any detail One of the questions that the SEC may look into is whether the terminati on of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earni ngs An SEC spokesman declined to comment Under accounting rules a companys transactions in its own shares cannot p roduce profits or losses whatever the effect on cash flow So a company th at sells its shares for each and buys them back at or at will report no earnings effect Enron said that the reduction to shareholders e quity and a related reduction in notes receivable is the result of Enron s termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver En ron shares in future periods Stephen Moore an analyst with Moodys Investors Service who has put Enron s debt on review for a possible downgrade said that while some of the deta ils were not clear Essentially Enrons promise was that a certain amount of Enrons shares would be worth billion The shares plummeted and the y were not worth that much Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings which leaves out some expense s and directs attention away from its balance sheet which is disclosed on ly in SEC filings not in the earnings news release The reduction in sh areholders equity would be shown only on the thirdquarter balance sheet which has yet to be released Earlier this year Jeffrey Skilling then Enrons chief executive reacted strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to p rovide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released He called the que stioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners Mr Skilling late r resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr Lay the chairman and former chief executive took back the latter title While Enron was riding high its often difficulttounderstand reports were generally seen as not being a problem The company appeared to be the domi nant force in the business of energy trading and to be able to produce phe nomenal profits When Mr Lay was reported as having played an important ro le in formulating the Bush administrations energy policies the aura was o nly enhanced In January the shares traded for But now with some of the companys ventures clearly having run into proble ms it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the compan ys reports That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all was be cause of the involvement of the chief financial officer and some have wond ered if there might have been similar deals with others Mr Lay has promised to make the companys financial reports easier to unde rstand and last weeks report was at first praised by some analysts for do ing just that In a news release yesterday Mr Lay said the company welcomed the SECs request for information We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest he said FRONT PAGE FIRST SECTION SEC probes Enron over financial dealings Financial Times Oct By JULIE EARLE JOHN LABATE and SHEILA MCNULTY Enron the US energy giant disclosed yesterday that the Securities and Exc hange Commission had asked it to provide financial information at the start of an informal inquiry The announcement follows a rapid selloff in the stock in reaction to Enron s surprise revelation last week of a Dollars bn charge to equity to eli minate the dilutive effects of closing one of its controversial financing v ehicles In revealing the SEC call for more detailed information regarding certain related party transactions Enron hopes to counter growing criticism that it should be more transparent We welcome this request said Kenneth Lay Enron chairman and chief executive officer We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest The SEC probe into Enrons financial dealings is an informal one at this st age according to the company and the request for documents is voluntary However SEC probes often begin lightly as investigators gather information on an issue Such a probe could turn into a formal investigation at any time In that ca se regulators would be armed with subpoena powers and could demand certain documents be handed over The SEC would not confirm or deny the existence of the Enron probe Mr Lay did not say which transactions the SEC was reviewing although analy sts believe they relate to Andrew Fastow Enron chief financial officer wh o has been reported to have run a limited partnership that bought assets va lued at hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron Analysts say the transactions while controversial because of Mr

AMERICAS Group full of surprises after failing to open up Financial Times Oct By SHEILA MCNULTY Ronald Barone joked he would have to get plenty of rest ahead of Enrons re sults last week noting the US energy companys reputation for producing wh at some analysts say is the most complicated of earnings reports The UBS Warburg analyst was nevertheless as illprepared as his peers for the announcement of a Dollars bn charge to equity to eliminate the dilu tive effects of closing one of its controversial financing vehicles The news overshadowed Enrons ontarget per cent increase in thirdquart er earnings per share sending the stock plunging The Securities and Exchange Commissions subsequent request for more inform ation about Enrons financial activities has reinforced analyst perceptions that the company should have been more transparent in its reporting Curt Launer of Credit Suisse First Boston says expectations for more disc losure had built up over the past two months Kenneth Lay Enron chairman had promised to be more forthcoming when he resumed the duties of chief exe cutive following the resignation of Jeff Skilling in August While Mr Lay did improve Enrons disclosure by creating headings for new bu siness segments and providing more detail within each of them the Dollars bn charge still caught the market off guard It came as a surprise to us said Stephen Moore of Moodys Investors Ser vice We should have been informed that it was there Mr Barone found it disturbing that Enron disclosed the charge in a fleetin g comment during its conference call with analysts and did not mention it in its ninepage news release Despite progress in other areas there appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved he said Enron contends that we did disclose it in the conference call and it was one of the first points raised in the Q and A session on the conference ca ll Mr Lay has pledged to cooperate with the SECs request which appears to b e part of an informal inquiry rather than an official investigation In the meantime he adds Enron will focus on its core businesses That is something analysts say Enron has strayed too far away from Ray Nil es of Salomon Smith Barney says the companys core franchise its wholesal e business is doing well Most of Enrons problems have arisen from

percent yesterday after the Houston en ergy company disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission request for inf ormation about Enrons ties to outside investment partnerships set up by th e companys chief financial officer The SEC would not comment on its action which Enron spokesman Mark Palmer called an informal inquiry not an investigation We welcome this reques t said Kenneth L Lay chairman and chief executive of the Houstonbased company But the announcement jarred investors confidence in the giant energytradi ng company already hurt by the unexpected resignation of chief executive J effrey K Skilling in August and heavy losses from investments in broadban d Internet and other technology ventures A lot of people threw in the towel today said Anatol Feygin an analyst with JP Morgan in New York The SEC request was made privately last Wednesday the day after Enron repo rted a billion writeoff of investment losses and restructuring charges from unsuccessful technology ventures and other operations The writeoffs left Enron with a million loss in the third quarter cents a share The Wall Street Journal reported last week that million of the writeof f was tied to losses at limited partnerships established by Enrons chief f inancial officer Andrew Fastow and run by him until July Enron told investment analysts last week that it had repurchased million shares of its stock held by

The partnerships engaged in bi llions of dollars in complex financial transactions involving Enron and mad e major investments in power plants and other assets alongside Enron An Enron shareholder has filed suit in Texas state court alleging that Enro ns board violated its duty to the company by permitting the chief financia l officer to engage in the outside transactions that allegedly earned milli ons of dollars in fees for himself and other investors in the partnerships What Enron received from the relationships is not clear Feygin said that the company had informed analysts about the limited partne rships which offered Enron a way to take positions in strategic but uncert ain technology ventures without detailing the outcomes in its public financ ial statements In hindsight that

filings made by Enron last year Both partnerships are described as investment companies that primarily buy or invest in businesses involved in energy and communications Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM partnerships in June amid criticism and questions from some on Wall Street about a potential conflict of intere st Investors worried Monday that Fastows duty to Enron shareholders competed

with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest Lay who is also Enrons chairman said in a statement Dilution Fears Enron has formed at least companies to serve as financing vehicles for its projects based on filings with the Texas secretary of state Fastow and other Enron executives are named as the controlling partners or the board members in the companies Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants removing the debt for those projects from Enrons books That allows Enron to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting what it views as secondary businesses Standard Poors debt analyst Todd Shipman said Enron brokers trades of electricity natural gas and other commodities as well as owns power plants and naturalgas pipelines Dismantling the affiliates would be costly Whitewing Management an affiliated company that has bought Enron power plants and lists Fastow as managing director holds preferred shares of Enron Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit rating drops below investment grade according to company filings That would dilute the value of common shareholders investment The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are out there Shipman said Investors are worried they might have to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they originally thought Worrisome Financing Enrons auditors and attorneys reviewed the companys related party arrangements the board approved them and they were disclosed in SEC filings Enron said in its statement That hasnt eased concerns The reduction of shareholder equity by billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to worry about Enrons other

Keeping Enron Off Balance By Peter Eavis mailto Senior Columnist TheStreetcom AM EDT URL marketsdetoxhtml Enron ENENYSE news commentary stock plunged last week after the energy giant revealed that a complex financing deal caused a billion h it to its equity But other big deals that have yet to receive much public scrutiny could further damage the companys balance sheet In the spotlight last week were transactions done with investment partnersh ips called LJM and LJM Cayman An examination of the LJMrelated equity w ritedown can be found here However the LJM deals make up only part of Enrons sophisticated financing arrangements Also at issue are two large trusts that contain assets Enron shifted from its balance sheet These are the billion Marlin Water Trus t II and the billion Osprey Trust usually known as Whitewing The key risk for investors is how Enron chooses to repay these trusts if th ey dont unwind as planned The company may end up issuing stock to repay m oney borrowed through the trusts This would dilute existing shareholders Alternatively Enron could resort to using cash raised through sales of on balance sheet assets But this would hamper efforts to reduce debt and depr ive the companys profitable business lines of muchneeded capital Whitewing and a Prayer Though set up by Enron Marlin II and Whitewing are legally distinct from t he company Institutional investors bought notes issued by the trusts The billion in proceeds from the notes flowed to Enron Both trusts are scheduled to unwind in Originally Enron had hoped to repay them by selling the trusts underlying assets This repayment method would have had a minimal impact on Enrons balance sheet However theres a potential problem brewing with this approach The value of the assets may be too low to raise sufficient funds to pay back the trus t investors Hence Enrons two unenviable options issuing stock or raisin g cash from its own balance sheet Enron treasurer Ben Glisan concedes that assets in Marlin II wont be suffi cient to pay it back But he adds that proceeds from planned sales of onba lance sheet assets will provide Enron with the necessary funds for Marlin I I When asked if Whitewings assets are adequate for repayment Glisan repl ied We believe so In reference to the two trusts Enron CEO Kenneth Lay said on a conference call Tuesday We anticipate the sale of assets will be the primary source of repayments Sterling Marlin TheStreetcom hasnt seen offering documentation for Whitewing Enron didn t provide it when requested But TSC has reviewed the Marlin II prospectus Heres how Marlin II works Enron took water assets primarily based in th e UK off its balance sheet and the Marlin II trust took a stake in them Meanwhile Marlin II issued senior debt to investors the proceeds of whi ch went to Enron The company didnt have to recognize these notes as debt on its balance sheet due to the structure of the trust Marlin II replaced a similar trust called Marlin that was set to mature at the end of this ye ar Ideally the aim was for Enron managers to maximize the value and profitabi lity of the assets over the life of Marlin and Marlin II so it could sell t hem off and pay down the trusts To cover the risk that asset sales wouldn t raise enough money Enron also pledged to issue as much new convertible p referred stock as might be needed to pay off the notes As it happened the water assets didnt perform well In fact Enron set up Marlin II in July to succeed the original Marlin because it wanted to avoi d paying off the first Marlin with convertible stock or with cash from its own balance sheet This move risked angering the rating agencies that had agreed not to treat Marlin as debt because of Enrons pledge to backstop it with preferred stock Suddenly it seemed Enron was wriggling out of its c ommitment to make good with stock Enrons Glisan responds that many of the investors in the first Marlin also invested in Marlin II illustrating that investors werent upset by the ma neuver Glisan says Enron almost certainly wont decide to issue stock to pay off M arlin II Instead he adds money from pending asset sales can be used to p ay it off when it matures in July When asked if Enron might use the e xpected billion in proceeds from selling Portland General the utility based in Portland Ore Glisan replied Thats a good one But using the Portland General windfall would run counter to Enrons freque ntly stated strategy of selling off lowyielding assets and investing the p roceeds in higheryielding businesses Portland General is almost certainly a more profitable business than the UKs Wessex Water which is the domi nant asset in Marlin II In addition doing so would mean Enron couldnt us e all the Portland proceeds to pay off debt Enron aims to get its debtto totalcapital ratio down to from the current Maturity What about Whitewing which matures in early Glisan lists Whitewings assets as Central American gas distribution assets turbines destined for European power stations interests in European power stations and various debt and equity participations in energy investments Glisan says these as sets can be sold to pay off the billion in notes issued by the trust But what would happen if the Whitewing assets cant fetch the necessary pri ce Enron could sell off more onbalancesheet assets But again this wou ldnt help debtreduction efforts and it may be running short of large ass ets that it can quickly sell Whitewing is backed with Enron convertible stock But Enron may be reluctan t to issue paper when its stock is so far below recent highs and current s hareholders may begrudge the prospect of further dilution Investors also need to keep their eyes on the earlyrepayment triggers of t he trusts In fact the stock pricerelated element of the triggers has alr eady been set off For Whitewing the stock has to fall below for M arlin II the stock has to be under However something else has to happen before the trust investors can claim their money back through asset sales and stock issuance Enrons credit rating must fall below investment grade That looks to be a long shot since its rating is currently three no tches above subinvestment grade But it is something the market will watch after Moodys said last week that it was putting Enron on review for a poss ible downgrade Despite all the questions stemming from the trusts Enron still seems keen to use the structure Last week Barclays Capital was inviting investors to subscribe to an Enronrelated entity called the Besson Trust This is bein g set up to enable Enron to monetize substantially all of its interests in EOTT Energy Partners an Enron affiliate that markets and transports crud e oil Expected proceeds from the deal are million according to the p rospectus Could Enron be setting up new trusts to pay off damaged old trus ts Due to offbalance sheet financings like Marlin II and Whitewing its clea r that uncertainty could weigh on Enrons battered stock for some time Why Enrons Writedown Unnerves Some Investors By Peter Eavis mailto Senior Columnist TheStreetcom AM EDT URL marketsdetoxhtml Enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors but its decision to red uce equity by billion in the third quarter has created dismay and conf usion in the market The action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner More important in vestors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect Enrons ba lance sheet profits and earnings guidance Enron didnt provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction Enron doesnt include a balance sheet in its earnings release so the equit y decrease couldnt be spotted in numbers supplied Tuesday And even though Enron did break out billion in earnings charges in its release the com pany didnt feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in the text Instead the public first heard about it on a Tuesday conference call CEO Kenneth Lay said Enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a s ocalled structured finance arrangement The Wall Street Journal later re ported that Enrons counterparty in this transaction was an investment par tnership called LJM CoInvestment which has set up and run by Enrons fin ance chief Andrew Fastow This is what Lay said on the Tuesday call about the equity move In connec tion with the early termination shareholders equity will be reduced appro ximately billion with a corresponding significant reduction in the nu mber of diluted shares outstanding According to The Journal Lay then sai d Wednesday on another call that Enron had repurchased million shares Enrons supporters count Lays mention of a reduction in the share count as bullish because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future But there are two possible problems with this theory First Enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to mak e per share in operating earnings next year Critically the company did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the million shares or not If the forecast does assume the exclusion of the million shares the company should have upped its pershare earning s forecast by around since thats the amount by which the share count w ill be reduced Enron needs to say what share count its using in its guida nce Second its almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever re corded casting a certain amount of doubt on Lays assertion that the share count will come down Why question the CEO Well in its annual report Enron included some disclosure of the million shares connected with LJM It reads At Dece mber Enron had derivative instrumentson million shares of Enron common stock The derivative instruments appear to be types of opti ons or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stoc k at agreed prices But these derivativeslinked shares dont show up where they should in the annual report in the table that breaks out the difference between the basi c and diluted share counts The line item in this table that shows options related shares totals only million shares which is close to the amount of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion Therefore that numbe r almost certainly doesnt include the million LJMrelated shares The fact is at least some of the million derivativeslinked shares should b e included if the derivatives were like normal options Thats because the LJM derivatives appear to have been in the money or profitable for the holders Typically all inthemoney optionsbased stock has to be included in the diluted share count And these LJM derivatives did appear to have that status at the end of Back then Enron stock was trading around way above the average level at which these derivatives made money f or LJM Maybe these werent simple options and had other conditions attached that e xcluded them from the diluted share count Thats what disclosure elsewhere in the annual report appears to imply Alternatively the options were emb edded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure though its hard think where Presumably investors will get a full explanation in Enrons quarterly fina ncial results filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission due by th e middle of November

Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Enron Corp might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron shares diluting the position of current shareholders However Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities known as the Marlin Water Trust II the Marlin Water Capital Corp II the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc The notes are coming due during the next months Mr Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes Also Enron is selling other assets Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least billion by the end of next year This amount includes cash proceeds of billion from the previously announced sale of Enrons Portland General Electric utility unit Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds to repay the notes Mr Glisan said But if we are wrong we will issue equity Mr Glisan said a worstcase scenario would involve issuing as much as billion in stock Enron said it has about million shares outstanding Making up any shortfall with equity has become

related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S Fastow In July Mr Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors On Monday Enron disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr Fastow Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said while we are extremely disappointed with our stock price our businesses are performing very well Mr Lay and other executives said Enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs Mr Fastow the chief financial officer took part in the conference call But neither he nor Mr Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastowrelated partnership which was known as LJM CoInvestment LP Mr Lay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement which has raised conflictofinterest questions among analysts and others Mr Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions Mr Lay said he was very concerned about the way Andys character has been loosely tossed about He added we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy Internal LJM documents indicate that Mr Fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership Billions of dollars of Enron assets and stock were involved in LJMrelated transactions according to Enron SEC filings During the conference call analysts even some who have been longtime Enron fans challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement and the companys often opaque financial reports Theres the appearance you are hiding something said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer You need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board Mr Lay responded Were trying to be as transparent as we can Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BusinessFinancial Desk Section C Enron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts By FLOYD NORRIS The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Enron has ample access to cash the companys chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional writeoffs stemming from unusual financing activities In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enrons stock plunged on Monday the chief executive Kenneth W Lay strongly defended the companys chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S Fastow the chief financial officer In addition Mr Fastow while declaring that Enron expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations declined to answer any questions about it The conference call which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange at first seemed to be reassuring investors Within minutes of the beginning of the call the share price rallied to But it soon began falling and ended the day down cents at The days low of was the lowest since Jan and was down percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of Until recently most investors focused on the companys reported operating earnings which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions some involving offbalancesheet financing One involving partnerships controlled by Mr Fastow led to a billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to SEC inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday One of the companys strongest supporters has been David Fleischer an analyst at Goldman Sachs But he told Mr Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information There is an appearance that you are hiding something he said After the call Mr Fleischer expressed disappointment Theyve engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about and that are hard to understand he said in an interview They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them as is needed he said But he said he was still recommending the stock I dont think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans he said In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company there is tremendous value here Mr Lay cited the SEC inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr Fastow But he emphasized that both he and the companys board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy Mr Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enrons reporting in conjunction with another offbalancesheet vehicle called Marlin That company owns onethird of Azurix an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex a British water utility The auditors have determined there is no writedown required he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management a money management firm Mr Grubman said that Marlin owed almost billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake Noting that Enron had paid about million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken writedowns on its investment in Azurix Mr Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares Mr Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details Eventually he cut off Mr Grubman I know youre trying to drive the stock price down and youve done a pretty good job of it Mr Lay said But lets move on to the next question Mr Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had billion in such debt outstanding He said it was backed by billion in bank lines of credit of which billion will expire next May if it is not renewed Mr Lay said he was sorry about the misunderstanding that resulted when his brief mention of the billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report but it did not He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future but made no promises The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings and so was not in the earnings release But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement The SEC is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin Mr Lay said the company will look into providing such statements Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Options

severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that Enrons dealings are aboveboard I for one find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions he said Lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships because of the SEC inquiry He did say Enron was aware an inherent conflict of interest would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with Enron In response Enron set up procedures which Lay said were rigorously followed to ensure shareholder interests wouldnt be compromised There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron he said adding that Enron wasnt obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in Enrons best interest Lay and Enrons board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Fastow he added Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from Wall Street Enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships It took a million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders equity by billion as a result During the

AP Tax Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved WASHINGTON AP General Motors IBM and Kmart are among corporations that would receive billions of dollars in tax refunds under a billion House Republican economic stimulus package Democrats say it is far too generous to companies and does too little for individuals Seven companies would get a total of billion in refunds of alternative minimum taxes they paid as far back as The tax which the House legislation also would repeal outright is intended to ensure a basic minimum income tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous deductions and credits IBM would get a billion refund according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service while GM would get million Kmart million and General Electric million Others specified for big refunds include energy giant Enron at million US Steel million and grocery chain Kroger million In addition the study found that Ford Motor Co would get a refund that could total billion while Chevrons could reach million Counting repeal of the tax corporations would get more than billion in tax relief from these minimum tax provisions in alone In addition the bill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firms doing a lot of overseas business providing them billion in tax relief over years The generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in the House GOP measure scheduled for a floor vote Wednesday Democrats say the measure is certain to change once it reaches the Senate the Bush administration also has signaled that billion is too costly Its clear the House bill cannot pass the Senate as it is said Sen John Breaux DLa For individuals the House legislation includes a new round of tax rebate checks for workers who didnt get them this summer and a cut in the current percent income tax rate to percent in four years earlier than under the justenacted tax cut The measure also reduces capital gains rates from percent to percent for most taxpayers enhances business equipment writeoffs and allows companies to deduct current losses against taxes paid five years earlier The primary sponsor Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas said in a newspaper opinion piece published Tuesday in USA Today that the legislation is a shot of adrenaline that will help restart the economy while not triggering inflation Businesses generate jobs and jobs are the core of a strong economy wrote Thomas RCalif While bipartisan support backs some of the House items Senate Democrats have been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers who lose health insurance Sen Max Baucus chairman of the Senate Finance Committee presented a billion proposal Tuesday that would extend unemployment benefits by weeks provide a percent federal match for COBRA health insurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for Medicaid The legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar to the House bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative minimum tax relief Tax cuts in the Baucus measure would total billion in far below the House GOP level This proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times helping this nation get back to work and recover quickly said Baucus DMont Other Democrats were working on spending programs Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd DWVa said he was putting together a billion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and food inspectors augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more vaccines Sen Charles Grassley RIowa said President Bush does not want the stimulus bill laden with additional spending Everything in this

conflictofinterest concerns being expressed by Wall Street analysts and major Enron investors On Monday Enron announced that the Se curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastowrelated transa ctions While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr Fastow as well as the companys dealings with the partnerships controversy over those arran gements clearly played a role in the executives departure In my continue d discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that rest oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO said Ch airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement Enron said Mr Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company He couldnt be reached for comment It remains to be seen how much Mr Fastows removal will assuage an increas ingly restive investment community The action came after the pm market close and followed a day in which Enrons stock once again plunged As of pm in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Enron shares were at down or It topped the Big Boards most active list at ne arly million shares more than twice the volume of the secondmostactiv e stock Several trades yesterday involved blocks of shares or more possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron stock Enrons shares are down about from the beginning of last week Earlier this

vehicles Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr Fastows departure could be seen as evidence that management does care about investor concerns H owever she adds the move also could be viewed by some investors coming a s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry as an admissi on of guilt Ms Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar gely because of uncertainties about the companys extremely complex financi al structure Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastowrelated dealings Worries and rumors about Enrons financial strength could be found in the s tock market yesterday Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible death spiral in which increasing c redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d o business with the company which would in turn weaken its finances and le ad to further business reductions Mr Fleischer a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company said he hasnt yet seen any eviden ce of such a problem However Mr Fleischer said Enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions

of the Securities and Exchange Commission In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO Kenneth L Lay Enrons chairman and chief executive said in a statement announcing the change Only one day before Mr Lay had told in vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy The company said that Mr Fastow had taken a leave of absence but it also named his successor Jeffrey McMahon the head of Enrons industrial market s group and a former corporate treasurer Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange wh ere Enrons shares fell to The price has been cut in half si nce Oct when Enron reported its thirdquarter earnings A billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi th partnerships that Mr Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning s news release Mr Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo llowed but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate billion writeoff that was disclosed in the earnings document and were angered wh en they later learned about it On Tuesday when both Mr Fastow and Mr Lay discussed the company with ana lysts on the conference call neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr Fastow Mr Lay cited the SEC inquiry in declining to discuss the detai ls of the transactions The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year but Enrons disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n ot lead to reported losses but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement That is one of the issues the SEC whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company is expected t o address Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying either i n cash or with stock if things went wrong On Tuesday Mr Fastow assure d investors that the company expects to continue to have sufficient liqui dity to meet normal obligations and said it had bank credit lines that w ere more than adequate Mr Fastow was viewed as one of the architects with Jeffrey K Skilling t he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August of the change in bu siness strategy that turned Enron from a gaspipeline company into a an ene rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following Its st ock price peaked in the summer of at According to a person close to the company while Mr McMahon Mr Fastows successor was Enrons treasurer he told Mr Skilling who at the time wa s the chief operating officer that he thought the partnerships involving M r Fastow presented a conflict of interest After that discussion Mr McMa hon moved to a different job at the company this person said Shares of Enron traded as low as yesterday afternoon the lowest pri ce for the stock since early before recovering In afterhours tradin g they fell to One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities to drop her rating to sell from hold She had lowered the rating to hold from buy on Mond ay After the SEC inquiry was announced she said in an interview yester day evening Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat as a gesture to the Street Now they are replacing him today The timing is a little late but I think it will be received positively by the Street But she said that investor

Wednesday came under scrutiny as the e xecutive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour saddling Enron with a billion charge to equity As details of this dea l and others have emerged over the past two weeks Enron stock has collap sed falling in just seven days Wednesday the stock fell a further on enormous volume signifying that oncefaithful mutual fund holders were

leave of absence Hes been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon formerly CEO of Enrons industrial markets group How might the Enron bulls spin this Likely they will point to McMahons a lleged opposition to Fastows role in the big hedging deal called LJM to show that the Fastow era is over The Wall Street Journal citing anonym ous sources reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained about Fastows possible conflict of interest Probably the fear was that Fastow couldnt serve Enron and LJM equally especially as he was allegedl y making a lot of money from LJM Clearly if McMahon turns out to be a new broom thats a positive for Enro n An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journals accoun t of McMahons stance on LJM was correct Not much else is encouraging however Fastows departure shows that it too k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action On a difficult conference call Tuesday CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back ing It took Wednesdays plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO In oth er words Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers How much fu rther does the stock have to fall to bring further muchneeded reforms at t he company The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastows replacement was nec essary to rebuild investor confidence Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery People got upset by one shad owy deal but no one knows exactly how the companys core energy trading bu siness makes money Its hard to believe the LJM deals were done in isolat ion and without the knowledge of the board In fact the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t he LJM transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad band business The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f rom being in broadband so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM as a way to hedge that volatility away This meant LJM entered agreements that gave it acce ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t he downside Should the whole board be on the hook too The spokeswoman re sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM transaction if it had not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the markets views Arguably thats downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish shortterm financing Letting things get this bad has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers It shows an u nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until theyre unavoidable The spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp
