<2139697.1075857675089.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,douglas@enron.com,2001-05-23 16:29:26,Project Slapshotto follow up from our meeting yesterday morning the total present val ue benefit from Project Slapshot is approximately million we do not a t this point know the exact benefit because it is dependent on the yet unde termined interest rate to be charged in connection with the EIM financing The benefit will be realized by EIM Canada and Enron Canada Corp through a reduction in the amount of taxes paid by each company The risk related to the transaction is that the interest deductions from the transaction ar e denied in part and as to the part denied EIM Canada and Enron Canada Co rp are required to pay interest to Revenue Canada on the amount of income offset by such denied interest deduction I will forward to you a calculat ion of the potential interest charge to Enron Canada Corp in this circumst ance as soon as I confirm with our Canadian counsel the method by which suc h interest charge is calculated and the likely rate at which it would be i mposed A more remote risk due to actions we are taking in the financing documents stemming from the transaction is that Revenue Canada could asser t a withholding tax on interest payments made by EIM Canada to the lender i n the transaction This risk would fall on EIM Canada I believe that it is highly unlikely that either risk will ever be realized and have obtained the highest level of comfort on this point possible from our Canadian coun sel absent their telling us that there is no risk specifically Blake Cas sels believes that there is a to percent likelihood that our position will be sustained if challenged I am attending the Enron Tax Conference on Thursday and Friday of this week but can be reached at sho uld you have questions regarding this transaction Best regards SHD
