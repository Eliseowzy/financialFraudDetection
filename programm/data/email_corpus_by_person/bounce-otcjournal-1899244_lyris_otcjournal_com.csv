company over two months ago and were fascinated by the potential You m ight not be familiar with the company but unless you live in a vacuum you should be familiar with the issues surrounding their technology Petapeer Holdings Inc owns the commercial rights to market the Gnottella Network t echnology which many see as the replacement for the highly publicized demi se of the online Napster Music

directly into other users computers and tra nsfer files directly Files are not limited to MP flies as is the case wi th Napster You can exchange anything from the most complex software to a r ecipe for fried chicken More importantly management at Petapeer Holding s claims their technology does not infringe on copyright laws Whereas Naps ter provides the ability to share files directly through Napsters server Gnotella does not Gnotella simply provides software which allows computers to interface over the internet and has no control over the exchange of fi les Therefore any violations would be the responsibility of the user not the software provider Today after the market closed Petapeer Holdings issued a very significant press release which has the potential to push th is virtually unknown stock much higher Petapeer Holdings announced it ha s filed a Provisional Patent Application for a new proprietary technology that will implement systems and methods for bolstering the Gnutella Network while generating revenue for Petapeer We believe this stock has the po tential to become high profile when one considers all the press which surro unded the Napster demise Furthermore
