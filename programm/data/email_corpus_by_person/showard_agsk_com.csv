Oaktrees lawyer What do you think My points are not directly responsive to the prior email but I think this gives us a hook to assert a position that you and I have discussed but never actually asserted Steve Bruce I am a little late answering your attached email Brian Barth met with Mike Swartz in the first half of in his capacity as counsel for Oaktree and in the context of Oaktrees written agreement and Mikes oral agreement that Oaktrees counsel would not disclose to or use for Farallon anything learned from Barth in the meeting which meeting Oaktree insisted take place pursuant to the parties written agreement In direct violation of the written and oral agreements Shawna Ballard thereafter disclosed the BarthSwartz meeting on the public record in Barths deposition and began asserting statements in the deposition that Brian had allegedly made to Mike Shawnas factual assertions about what Brian said were in fact wrong but that is beside the point Until Shawna made her disclosures none of the defendants was even aware that the meeting had taken place Now as a result of Shawnas disclosures in a variety of ways the other defendants have initiated formal and informal discovery against Enron and are otherwise taking positions adverse to Enron Enron intends to hold Oaktree responsible for all damages arising out of its breach of its written agreement with Enron including Enrons substantially increased attorneys fees in the various litigations PM Steve I am having a little trouble understanding the complaints stated in your two emails repeated below With regard to the Barth deposition Section of the parties cooperation agreement expressly authorizes Oaktree to reveal information obtained from ECT to potential witnesses or even as exhibits in depositions With regard to our document production Section again specifically authorizes us to provide documents or information obtained from ECT in responding to discovery requests Moreover we know of no know proper privilege objection that would have allowed us to withhold any of the materials we have produced in response to NatWests subpoena Our production in response to NatWests subpoena is substantially complete If after you have reviewed that production you continue to believe that we are in error with regard to the OaktreeECT agreement or the proper scope of our production give me a call and we discuss it Thanks Steve Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday April PM To Subject your production of HBD docs This production of documents went far beyond anything required by the document requests eg an email from me to Shawna apologizing for misspelling her name and violated the confidentiality provisions of the agreement between Oaktree and Enron Steve Howard Alschuler Grossman Stein Kahan LLP phone fax email Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday April PM To Subject Your response to NatWests Second request for docs I just reviewed this pleading Before you produce any docs responsive to Request No I would like the opportunity to review the docs We believe that Oaktree breached its agreement with Enron when Shawna disclosed in the middle of Barths deposition that Mike Swartz had met with Barth and further disclosed inaccurately we believe portions of the content of that meeting We would hope that Oaktree is not on the verge of a further breach

Oaktrees lawyer What do you think My points are not directly responsive to the prior email but I think this gives us a hook to assert a position that you and I have discussed but never actually asserted Steve Bruce I am a little late answering your attached email Brian Barth met with Mike Swartz in the first half of in his capacity as counsel for Oaktree and in the context of Oaktrees written agreement and Mikes oral agreement that Oaktrees counsel would not disclose to or use for Farallon anything learned from Barth in the meeting which meeting Oaktree insisted take place pursuant to the parties written agreement In direct violation of the written and oral agreements Shawna Ballard thereafter disclosed the BarthSwartz meeting on the public record in Barths deposition and began asserting statements in the deposition that Brian had allegedly made to Mike Shawnas factual assertions about what Brian said were in fact wrong but that is beside the point Until Shawna made her disclosures none of the defendants was even aware that the meeting had taken place Now as a result of Shawnas disclosures in a variety of ways the other defendants have initiated formal and informal discovery against Enron and are otherwise taking positions adverse to Enron Enron intends to hold Oaktree responsible for all damages arising out of its breach of its written agreement with Enron including Enrons substantially increased attorneys fees in the various litigations PM Steve I am having a little trouble understanding the complaints stated in your two emails repeated below With regard to the Barth deposition Section of the parties cooperation agreement expressly authorizes Oaktree to reveal information obtained from ECT to potential witnesses or even as exhibits in depositions With regard to our document production Section again specifically authorizes us to provide documents or information obtained from ECT in responding to discovery requests Moreover we know of no know proper privilege objection that would have allowed us to withhold any of the materials we have produced in response to NatWests subpoena Our production in response to NatWests subpoena is substantially complete If after you have reviewed that production you continue to believe that we are in error with regard to the OaktreeECT agreement or the proper scope of our production give me a call and we discuss it Thanks Steve Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday April PM To Subject your production of HBD docs This production of documents went far beyond anything required by the

<8706568.1075853246617.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,showard@agsk.com,2001-04-27 10:51:00,NSM UpdateThe only significant deposition this week is taking place in Minneapolis The deponent is Arthur Cobb a disclosuredue diligence expert retained by Robins Kaplan in several cases in which Enron is not named Mr Cobbs report did not mention ECT Securities and the California plaintiffs did not designate him to testify in the CA cases so we decided not to attend his deposition We are getting daily transcripts by email Next week an expert designated by the CA plaintiffs on causation and damage issues is being deposed in San Francisco Roland has a scheduling conflict so I am sending Jonathan Goldblatt The subject on which we want to ask questions is damages relating to certain purchases by Farallon after the initial offering This is a very discrete area easy to understand and Jonathan is on top of it I believe that you recently received a bill from Gerry McGrath Gerry worked very hard on his report putting in about more hours than he thought he would when he agreed to cap the total fee for his report He is very focused on the requirement in his engagement letter that he be paid in days I think Gerry did quite a good job and we definitely need his best effort going forward I would urge Enron to pay Gerrys bill very promptly Farallon is currently threatening to move to compel further answers to interrogatories from us It is much ado about nothing We just want to deal with it in the least expensive way Many of the plaintiffs have filed motions around the country including in CA seeking to compel Natwest to produce more audio tapes of employee conversations My guess is that the plaintiffs have found more good stuff and Natwest is trying to limit their losses We are hard at work on the research that you and I have been discussing It is frankly quite complex and involves several unanswered questions of law The problem is that CA has a special statutory contribution provision pro rata not relative fault in the state securities statutes and a common law doctrine of partial indemnity in tort actions that is based on relative fault The later doctrine may not apply to the securities causes of action against ECT Securities but definitely applies to the common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation causes of action How all of this works together is virtually uncharted With reference to your question about procedures at trial none of the defendants has crosscomplained against the other defendants for a determination of relative fault in the pending case and on the basis of the current pleadings no such determination will be made at trial If Enron goes to trial and loses along with others theoretically the plaintiffs could collect their entire judgment from Enron and leave Enron to pursue the other defendants posttrial for their respective shares of the liability whether such shares are determined pro rata or by relative fault We are working on a memorandum or outline that will lay all of this out for you I think you will find that Enron has some powerful incentives to settle assuming that we can get the price low enough Steve Howard Alschuler Grossman Stein Kahan LLP phone fax cell email ALSCHULER GROSSMAN STEIN KAHAN LLP ATTORNEYS AT LAW wwwagskcom Century Park East ThirtyNinth Floor Los Angeles CA Tel Fax This transmission is intended only for the use of the addressee and may contain information that is privileged confidential and exempt from disclosure under applicable law If you are not the intended recipient or the employee or agent responsible for delivering the message to the intended recipient you are hereby notified that any dissemination distribution or copying of this communication is strictly prohibited If you have received this communication in error please notify us immediately via email at or by telephone at Thank you
