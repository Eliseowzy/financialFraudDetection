roughly would be cut A pparently Friday May Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti es the maintenance information He also indicated that our Lonestarrep said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system was LonestarCarthage and LonestarKaty Plant Neither of the plants supp liers ApacheCinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day June Cuts did occur as we were warned Of the total nomination of M M MM flowed for todays gas flow The supplier breakout is ApacheCi nergy MM and WilliamsMM Yesterday Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for todays flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June I also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a backup The plant ca n burn No low sulfur fuel oil Mike indicated that the plant would not w ant to do that and hadnt burned oil in quite some time I told Mike that I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera ge with the suppliers He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t he plant I told him that I wasnt familiar with Lonestar specifically but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a plant of its size they probably have remote control capabilities If not they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language Th e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right to choose the supply pointpoints into Lonestars system from a list of pri mary or secondary points in Exhibit A If the plants transportation contr act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in to Lonestars system at a location that will flow on the plants transporta tion agreement If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels Yeste rday I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy T om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didnt have a copy of the amendment Sounds like the amendment may have changed some of the delivery points I told Tom at Cinergy that my primary concern w as flowing gas supply to the plant Tom was suggesting that this may be a force majuere event I told him I didnt interpretthe force majuere lan guage that way The force majuere language addresses freezeoffs and line breaks but not maintenance I also told him that the contract has a provis ion for transportation interruption In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op erational issues and not monetary issues I told him we could address the financial resolution per the contract after the event was over I told him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th e pipe cutting back their gas supply Events of June This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy They are supplying MM at AquilaKaty into Lonestar for June Williams is buying MM at Carthage and MM at HLPL for June Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju ne Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June after the pigging was completed They will pay back the volume ratably fo r the remainder or in a day Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around to say the plant needed to cut back to the MM flowing gas volume for today The plants burn rate was causing the pig to run to fast Russ is the manager of the transp ortation administration department at Lonestar I called Russ back at pm to inquire about the problem I asked him to call gas control and see w hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem I also called Mike to inform him of the new events Russ called back and said the run would b e over at pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul d help was El Paso Field ServicesEnnis He also indicated that the pressu re had stabilized and the plant may be able to make it through the run without the incremental gas I called Cinergy a nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou ld let me know At Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and the cost would be to more than the contract price She said t hat they didnt think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract They would buy the gas if we would agree to pay the price I called Mike at White Pines a nd ask him what he wanted to do He indicated that he wanted us me to buy the gas I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the n om Russ said the plant was burning more Now they were burning MM and requested they cut back to their nominated volume of MM I told Russ I d idnt think that they could be I would call Mike confirmed that they coul d not He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off eve n to MW He said Brazos is playing chicken and are requesting ever ything they have I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the co ntract after the pigging event is completed I called Michelle with my pro posal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back We agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after the event was over Michelle called back and said the gas was going to com e from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered Events of June The plant made it through the June gas day on gas I spoke with Michelle and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June the sa me as June She said that Apache didnt think they were liable to make u p the gas they shorted us for June She said I could talk with Pat Green at Apache regarding the issue Williams moved their gas from Carthage to HPL for June I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the poin

Robin Subjectponderosa plant service events for gas days june Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days I hope we dont need Events of June Gas service to the plant has been challenging Lonestar Pipeline is runnin g a pig for June Lonestar told us that roughly would be cut A pparently Friday May Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti es the maintenance information He also indicated that our Lonestarrep said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system was LonestarCarthage and LonestarKaty Plant Neither of the plants supp liers ApacheCinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day June Cuts did occur as we were warned Of the total nomination of M M MM flowed for todays gas flow The supplier breakout is ApacheCi nergy MM and WilliamsMM Yesterday Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for todays flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June I also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a backup The plant ca n burn No low sulfur fuel oil Mike indicated that the plant would not w ant to do that and hadnt burned oil in quite some time I told Mike that I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera ge with the suppliers He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t he plant I told him that I wasnt familiar with Lonestar specifically but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a plant of its size they probably have remote control capabilities If not they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language Th e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right to choose the supply pointpoints into Lonestars system from a list of pri mary or secondary points in Exhibit A If the plants transportation contr act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in to Lonestars system at a location that will flow on the plants transporta tion agreement If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels Yeste rday I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy T om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didnt have a copy of the amendment Sounds like the amendment may have changed some of the delivery points I told Tom at Cinergy that my primary concern w as flowing gas supply to the plant Tom was suggesting that this may be a force majuere event I told him I didnt interpretthe force majuere lan guage that way The force majuere language addresses freezeoffs and line breaks but not maintenance I also told him that the contract has a provis ion for transportation interruption In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op erational issues and not monetary issues I told him we could address the financial resolution per the contract after the event was over I told him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th e pipe cutting back their gas supply Events of June This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy They are supplying MM at AquilaKaty into Lonestar for June Williams is buying MM at Carthage and MM at HLPL for June Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju ne Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June after the pigging was completed They will pay back the volume ratably fo r the remainder or in a day Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around to say the plant needed to cut back to the MM flowing gas volume for today The plants burn rate was causing the pig to run to fast Russ is the manager of the transp ortation administration department at Lonestar I called Russ back at pm to inquire about the problem I asked him to call gas control and see w hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem I also called Mike to inform him of the new events Russ called back and said the run would b e over at pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul d help was El Paso Field ServicesEnnis He also indicated that the pressu re had stabilized and the plant may be able to make it through the run without the incremental gas I called Cinergy a nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou ld let me know At Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and the cost would be to more than the contract price She said t hat they didnt think Apache was liable for the costs

Phil Shemin V Proctor Email Dhont Margaret Subject Sonat Park Loan Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat This is what we have found out over the last days ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonats scheduling Christina Sanchez ENA Scheduler believes that under normal conditions we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it I need to know What volume to sell I assume we are talking about dth on deal which means we ignore the loaned volume of dth on deal What period do I sell the gas for All out by March st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline Or base load in April I prefer all out by March st but I would like to ask the pipeline if thats ok How many bids do I need to get I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January see items in red down below Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas I dont want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it All of my previous notes are shown below in blue Summary Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance dth per my conversation with Sonat to offset ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October According to Sonat the payment was due November but ENA did not pay Sonats motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March th History Per Dave Dyer at Sonat ENA has Park Loan PAL contracts with Sonat All PALs with Sonat are under master contract PAL Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract Deal ENA borrowed a total of dth from Nov rdth and has not paid this back ENA still owes Sonat dth The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with days notice on any days on SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA FOR THIS DEAL because Sonat needed to get gas off the system Deal ENA parked dth in August to come out in Jan Sonat let ENA withdraw on leaving a balance of dth In Jan ENA withdrew dth per day for the stth That left a balance of dth On Jan th Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset the Loaned gas on deal dth and to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October According to Sonat the remaining balance on this deal is dth parked in Aug wd in Nov wd in Jan balance on According to Sonats letter Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets According to Dave ENA is being billed x daily balance in this account ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August Other items ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October ENA purchased at an average price of According to Sonat ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy ENA also sold Sonat gas dth day at sitara in January and dth day at in May sitara ENA used dth of the parked gas on deal to supply the dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park ENA defaulted on dth of the Sonat deal in January Sonats in house legal counsel is Patti Frances I left a message for Patti to call me Patti Frances returned my call Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March th I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the dth dth per day for Jan st th that ENA did supply Patti said she didnt think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA

see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PALs meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream PM Tammi Depaolis at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out PM Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonats legal department

Phil Shemin V Proctor Email Dhont Margaret Subject Sonat Park Loan Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat This is what we have found out over the last days ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonats scheduling Christina Sanchez ENA Scheduler believes that under normal conditions we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it I need to know What volume to sell I assume we are talking about dth on deal which means we ignore the loaned volume of dth on deal What period do I sell the gas for All out by March st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline Or base load in April I prefer all out by March st but I would like to ask the pipeline if thats ok How many bids do I need to get I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January see items in red down below Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas I dont want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it All of my previous notes are shown below in blue Summary Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance dth per my conversation with Sonat to offset ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October According to Sonat the payment was due November but ENA did not pay Sonats motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March th History Per Dave Dyer at Sonat ENA has Park Loan PAL contracts with Sonat All PALs with Sonat are under master contract PAL Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract Deal ENA borrowed a total of dth from Nov rdth and has not paid this back ENA still owes Sonat dth The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with days notice on any days on SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA FOR THIS DEAL because Sonat needed to get gas off the system Deal ENA parked dth in August to come out in Jan Sonat let ENA withdraw on leaving a balance of dth In Jan ENA withdrew dth per day for the stth That left a balance of dth On Jan th Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset the Loaned gas on deal dth and to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October According to Sonat the remaining balance on this deal is dth parked in Aug wd in Nov wd in Jan balance on According to Sonats letter Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets According to Dave ENA is being billed x daily balance in this account ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August Other items ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October ENA purchased at an average price of According to Sonat ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy ENA also sold Sonat gas dth day at sitara in January and dth day at in May sitara ENA used dth of the parked gas on deal to supply the dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park ENA defaulted on dth of the Sonat deal in January Sonats in house legal counsel is Patti Frances I left a message for Patti to call me Patti Frances returned my call Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March th I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the dth dth per day for Jan st th that ENA did supply Patti said she didnt think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed She will check on it and call me back Per Kay Mann Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract PM Left a followup message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on Per Ruth Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal Christina Sanchez ENA Scheduler will find out if we still have access to Sonats EBB and if we can nominate the gas out of the PALs Per Christina ENAs IDs and passwords have been cancelled Christina called Barbara Gilbert ENAs account rep at Sonat Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonats legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PALs meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream PM Tammi Depaolis at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination I need to

discussion he and I had regarding the subject matter The focus was primairly external factors that are negatively impacting the liklihood of these deals with only cursory mention of internal issues I thought it might be helpful as part of our discussion at PM today Ed Original Message From McMichael Jr Ed Sent Wednesday July PM To Vickers Frank W Subject Gas Supply Outsourcing Asset Management Issues Frank below are my initial thoughts If I come up with others I will forward them along Please review and then lets discuss Feel free to forward this to anyone you wish Regards Ed Stranded Costs are no longer a risk Gas LDC unbundling has slowed or stopped Hence the previously perceived market risk ie stranded costs is no longer present Gas Cost disallowance risk is diminished Even with extraordinarily high prices this winter and most every LDC buying monthly index gas there was virtually no PUC gas cost disallowance It was a political hot potato for a few months but any previously perceived price risk is diminished In many states LDCs are now being encouraged by their PUCs to start using a portfolio approach incorporating fixed price caps and collars to dampen commodity price volatility Such initiatives is certainly not consistent with an exit of the merchant function Minimizes the importance of the VP of Gas Supply Many LDCs have created Gas Cost Incentives andor Transport Demand Cost Incentives to generate shareholder value The previously pass through aspect of the LDC gas supply function has given way to a situation where the VP of Gas Supply for most LDCs now have some profit potential These profits are usually necessary for the LDC to achieve its regulated rate of return but in some cases are incremental Hence in many cases these individuals have become more valuable to their organizations Loss of core competency Most LDCs have created groups and empowered people to manage their commodity and service contracts for profit as discussed above As such eliminating these jobs and redeploying andor terminating employees is viewed as a risk The risk is that they would potentially loose these skill sets that they think they have developed over the past several years which many now view as one of their core competencies Ego factor Along with the core competency issue above many LDC executives do not want to admit that Enron can manage their assets better that they can do it themselves Further many view Enron as a competitor in cases where they have set up a wholesale trading business on the backs of their ratepayers Some examples include AGLVNG KeySpan BUGLILCO NUI NJ Natural and PSEG Many LDCs have standardized outsourcing Many LDCs especially those who do not have Gas Cost Incentive mechanisms have been doing seasonal NovMar or AprOct or one year RFP type partial or full outsourcing for several years These LDCs use these arrangements to either make money or appease their PUC and ratepayer advocate by illustrating that they are optimizing their assets andor reducing gas costs However to either mitigate the need to seek PUC approval or minimize the risk of gas cost disallowance these standardized deals limit opportunity andor add risk in a number of ways a RFP deals go to the highest bidder most of which have littleno internal controlsdiscipline and are frequently dominated by origination not trading b The deals are in an RFP format where new ideas and original thought is typically shared with competitors c LDCs often demand structures that allow them to retain mostall of the optionality thereby reducingeliminating the ability to mark income ie accrual only d Load following deals which most all of these deals are for only one season increase the likelihood of a warmercolder than normal season e The start up costs eg dedicated people web site special accounting special reporting etc have to be recovered over a short time frame Industry consolidation Several LDC mergers have occurred over the past two or three years In many cases these mergers were done for synergistic reasons and frequently with LDCs that are served by one or more of the same pipelines It is safe to say that most have ascribed some acquisition value to andor used asset optimization in an attempt to gain PUC approval of the merger In many of these situations the LDCs try to consolidate gas supply across the companies and have frequently pushed to have such functions considered an unregulated part of their business Some of these mergers include KeySpan BUG LILCO and the Boston GasEssexColonial Southern Union PG Energy ProvGas and Valley Gas Energy East NYSEG Southern Connecticut Connecticut Natural ConEdison Orange Rockland NUI Elizabethtown Virginia Gas Company City Gas of Florida North Carolina other smaller ones and Atlanta Gas Light AGL Chattanooga and Virginia Natural Gas
