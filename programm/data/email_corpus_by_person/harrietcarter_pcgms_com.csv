common sense safety measures that are especially important to remember with trees lights and decorations For a safe holiday please take a minute to think about some tips Ive found come in handy Trees Select only a freshly cut tree The needles should not be falling off from dryness Keep the tree outside or in a garage until youre ready to decorate it A diagonal cut in the tree trunk will allow the tree to absorb water This will allow the tree to soak up water from the stand A tree will use gallon of water every two days so be sure to check the water level daily Trees should be at least three feet away from heat sources such as fireplaces candles and radiators also never block an exit with the tree Artificial trees should bear the UL label Never use electric lights on metal trees like the old silver trees To avoid electric shock on metal trees use colored spotlights securely mounted above or below the tree never fastened directly on it Plastic trees should be made of fire resistant material Holiday Lights Use only UL approved tree lights Check for frayed or bare wiring lights with cracked or broken sockets or loose connections If they show signs of wear and tear throw them away Use only ULlisted lights and no more than strands linked together Decorations can cause overloaded circuits Watch for signs of lights dimming Turn off all lights on trees and other decorations when you go to bed or leave the house Keep outdoor electrical connectors above ground and out of puddles and snow Tree Ornaments and Trimmings Avoid placing small or breakable ornaments on lower branches where children or pets can reach them and knock them off Also be careful about putting edible decorations low where pets and kids can reach them All of us at HarrietCartercom wish you a safe happy and
