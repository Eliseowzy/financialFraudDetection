David L ES Tony ES Subject EMERGENCY CONFERENCE REGARDING CALIFORNIA FINAL CALL FOR AGENDA ITEMS INPUT I have worked closely with Anthony Mazy Calif Public Utility Comm Office of Ratepayer Advocates in the past and he asked me to provide input from Enron with our perspective on the energy mess in California for a conference they are putting together in October Prior to joining EES I trained the CPUC ORA staff on a variety of issues and have earned their trust However I feel that the Enron input into this CPUC conference would be more appropriately provided by other members of the EES ENA team so I wanted to pass this email along to you for your review and action as needed Let me know if my relationship with Anthony and other members of the CPUC staff could be useful in advancing Enrons positions at this conference Jim Trudeau Director Power Quality Services Forwarded by James TrudeauSFOEES on AM Mazy Anthony on PM To cc Subject EMERGENCY CONFERENCE REGARDING CALIFORNIA FINAL CALL FOR AGENDA ITEMS INPUT CONFERENCE THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER LESSONS LEARNED Working Title DATE Saturday October LOCATION University of California Berkeley The CPUC Office of Ratepayer Advocates ORA together with the University of California is organizing a special conference Saturday October to address the current wholesale electricity market situation as manifest in San Diego and in light of both the economic framework and industrial realities in which utility restructuring is taking place We wish to emphasize the importance of maintaining consistent and predictable forward progress with the restructuring of the electric services industry while remediating structural shortcomings as they appear The need for a quick and effective response to the cost escalation in California is urgent Meanwhile we do not want to overlook emerging generation and information technologies and their appropriate role in an increasingly competitive energy and utility sector Your input is urgently requested to develop the detailed agenda for this workshopconference We have had the opportunity to speak with some of you directly and we appreciate your comments We are presently concluding negotiations with key national observers to be participants and must complete the detailed agenda this week If you have any further topical insights to share with us I must have your input no later than pm Pacific time Thursday September By pm Wednesday if at all possible Let me emphasize that today we are only concerned with conceptual topical content so please do not trouble yourselves with highly stylized presentations Our immediate objective is to release a preliminary program with a partial list of key participants by Monday September th that we believe is likely to secure the active support of a wide range of industry stakeholders We plan to distribute a final program by Monday September th Please suggest topical areas that you can help develop or believe are essential to the success of this program We will be particularly interested in your informed practical insights into the daily operations of the electric services industry from various perspectives that help clarify problems and distinguish truly problematic issues from those misunderstood the political and legislative processes in California as they may tend to suggest effective courses of action to promote shortterm market accommodations that are consistent with and constructive toward longterm goals for industry restructuring case studies from other jurisdictions that shed light on the probable response of Californias institutions to any of the various proposed solutions currently circulating case studies of anachronistic or otherwise inefficient industry practices impeding development interconnection or operation of distributed generation or the sale or other transfer of the energy produced case studies of market power abuse or gaming in both transmission and generation proposals for innovative treatment of costeffective emerging generation andor information technologies proposals for developing greater diversity of generation technologies andor energy providers within the state otherwise appropriate technical economic or regulatory principles and practices that are being misrepresented in the academic trade or popular press or other media distinguishing informational difficulties or factual disagreements from policy conflicts or conflicts of interest and specific suggestions for speakers who are particularly effective in addressing specific key issues or establishing confidence with the target audiences Attendance at this conferenceworkshop will be limited with approximately onehalf of the seats reserved for key policymakers andor their aides key agency staff and the speakers The remaining seats will be allocated among interested consumer representatives manufacturers vendors developers and other endusers and local government and community and business representatives We presently envision the conference to include one or two key speakers with four panels of three to seven persons each addressing specific topics We are also reserving facilities for Friday evening to address topical seminars requested by decisionmakers andor their key staff and additional facilities for Sunday morning when the information technology and distributed generation communities will be invited to provide additional followon to questions and comments offered by key policymakers on Saturday Some have commented that we should have started this as much as a year ago Unfortunately a year ago we did not know that today we would have doubled and tripled consumer energy bills or a MWH wholesale price cap much less an intense acrosstheboard attack on electric restructuring by some parties We are especially concerned about the efforts of some distribution utilities to establish a foothold in DG the efforts of some utilities and the independent system operator to restrict distributionlevel wheeling and the aggregation it would facilitate and the latest proposal to reintegrate metering into the distribution utility after it was successfully unbundled for the benefit of competitive Energy Service Providers Likewise language in recent legislation echoing regulatory arguments for retrenchment cannot be brushed aside We understand the difficulty of organizing such an event on less than two months notice but we also appreciate the importance of the subject as we are sure you do as well We are committed to preparing an event worthy of the time and attention of both key national observers and topranked California policymakers in the executive legislative and regulatory arenas and we would welcome your active assistance If you have any questions you are welcomed to call me at from AM to PM Pacific time For those with particularly busy schedules or time zone considerations you are welcomed to call me at my personal telephone from to AM Pacific time
