<919589.1075855002594.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lokay@bigfoot.com,2001-07-17 13:31:26,Interesting articleInteresting article especially since it came from Britain It does mention Enron too The next global city The blob that ate east Texas Jun st HOUSTON From The Economist print edition June For most outsiders Texas is a foreign country Its biggest city though might surprise the rest of the world WHEN a Texan in a big hat tells you how wonderful his home town is reach for the salt Bob Lanier the former mayor of Houston isnt actually wearing a Stetson as he gazes from his penthouse down on a city that sprawls miles away in every direction But metaphorically he is Houston he claims could become one of the great cities of the world The remarkable thing is that he might be right From the time the city was founded in until the s Houston doubled in size almost every decade Then despite one of the deepest slumps any city had experienced since the s the metropolitan area managed to add m people in the s to grow to m making Houston the fourthlargest city in America It is already bigger than Berlin and with a GDP of around billion a year has a larger economy than Hong Kong Because it is the nearest metropolis to the cities of northern Mexico it may attract another m people over the next two decades which would give it almost the same size of population as London has now But a global city These are few and far between Houston can hardly dream of becoming a global financial centre like London New York or Tokyo But its business leaders think it could become a cosmopolitan entrepreneurial hub a Hong Kong a San Francisco or even a new Los Angeles It shares LAs smog its sprawl its Latino culture even its ugly hubris and by some measures it surpasses LAs ability to reinvent its economy Can it use its adaptability to turn itself into a properly international place Oil be there for you Its hopes still depend disproportionately on its most global industry Energy accounts for half of Houstons economy During the s while the rest of America stagflated Houston boomed as high oil prices sucked billions into the countrys oil capital In that decade alone the city built almost as much new office space as the total amount of commercial property available in San Francisco Money was being lent and business plans formed on the assumption that oil would go to a barrel At the height of the boom about of the citys economy was oilrelated The bust was traumatic By the mids all that new office space stood empty Every big local bank was taken over Only one of the property developers then in business is left Unsurprisingly a certain paranoia lingers in the city about the oil business The Greater Houston Partnership the main business lobby has spent the past years frantically encouraging the city to diversify Yet the fact is that the energy business and Houston itself have emerged stronger from the terrible bust As company after company was forced to cut back they collapsed their operations back into Houston and seem unlikely to be dispersed again In when oil slumped to a barrel and the number of oil rigs in America fell to its lowest point in living memory Houston still managed to add energy jobs Now another boom is in prospect with oil prices high again Matt Simmonds the head of a local energy consultancy argues that Americas past reluctance to build new power plants will force it to increase energy capacity by around in the next ten or years The rig count is already above last year and natural gas exploration is soaring If oil prices stay high a big if and if other countries share Americas energy worries Houston will grow in importance It is hampered by a wildcatting reputation In fact the energy business is changing in three significant ways and Houston is the centre of all of them First technology Not long ago oil drills went down to feet metres Now they go to feet Companies use fourdimensional computer imaging to plan new fields time is the fourth This is making oil an informationintensive business and puts a premium on the kinds of skills available in Houston Second the cost of new oilfield exploration and development has risen so far that even newly merged behemoths cannot always finance them alone This makes dealmaking vital which is good for the city where deals are made If you are not attending say lunch at Houstons Petroleum Club you are out of the loop Third and most important oil is now only part of a bigger energy business which includes electricity Once divided into selfcontained regional markets run by local utilities the electricity business is being changed by the gradual emergence of a national grid dominated by power producers and traders Big users now decide whether to buy power at long or shortterm rates rather as they arrange their financing A new business of energy arbitraging is emerging and itscentre is Houston Three of the five new skyscrapers going up downtown have as their main tenants energy companies that did not exist ten years ago One of them Enron is building a squarefoot trading floor singlecompany answer to the Chicago Board of Trade Enron has probably been Houstons most successful energy company of the past ten years It has never explored for pumped up or refined a single drop ofoil Out of the black stuff However wellplaced Houston is to take advantage of the energy business it will never be a great city as a onetrick pony Its boosters point to other strengths Trade Houston is Americassecond largest port which is remarkable considering it is miles from the sea Computers The city is home to Compaq Americas thirdlargest PC maker If you include Dell based in Austin two of America four big computer firms are in southeast Texas not Silicon Valley Space The National Aeronautics and Space Administration centre is in Houston thanks to LyndonJohnson a native son Medicine Houston is home to probably the largest medical complex in the world In a moment of extraordinary optimism the city set aside acres in the middle of town for medicine The hospitals clinics and research centres of the Texas Medical Centre employ people and deal with patients a day St Lukes has performed more heart surgery than any other hospital in the world MD Anderson and the Texas Childrens Hospital are among the top two in their respective specialities cancerand paediatrics This list has holes in it Houston has no real financial services the mainstay of the biggest global cities or pharmaceuticals despite the medical centre And some of its new industries are less robust than the boosters claim Its ports success depends on the vagaries of Mexicos economy Space does not employ many people and is unlikely to grow until the faroff day when the commercialisation of space arrives The Texas Medical Centre is set up on a notforprofit basis so it has not been able to commercialise its activities hence the lack of drug firms though a new biotechnology park may help In fact Houstons main hope for diversifying lies not so much in particular sectors as in something intangible its stunning ability to create new firms For the past three years Houston has created more new companies than any city in America It is almost certainly the best place either to start a business or find a firsttime job The reasons for this are the real driving forces behind its success The beauty of entrepreneurialism The first is unmeasurable a noholdsbarred optimism of the old school One survey shows that about twothirds of Americans agree with the assertion that if you work hard in this city eventually you will succeed But Houstons figure even at the bottom of the citys recession was and now it is the highestever and says the surveys author Stephen Klineberg of Rice University the highest of any bigAmerican city It may not be true that anything is possible in Houston but people act as if it were Bill Gilmer the chief economist of the Houston branch of the Federal Reserve system argues that this explains why Houston recovered so fast from the oil bust unemployed engineers went out and set up their own firms just as aerospace engineers did in Los Angeles when the end of the cold war put them out of business The second advantage is technical Uniquely for an American metropolis Houston has no citywide zoning ordinances When planning decisions are made they are made by developers on their own land For the wouldbe entrepreneur it is thus easier and cheaper to find a place to set up shop in Houston than in any other city in America Lack of zoning laws hands power to developers who insist that new developments be large to capture economies of scale They expand in leapfrog fashion ignoring small acre plots near the city centre in favour of vast planned towns further out This drives land prices sharply down especially the further you go from the centre On top of that an aversion to red tape makes it easy to get building permits Barton Smith a land economist at the University of Houston reckons lack of red tape is at least as important to keep costs low as lack of zoning laws Lack of zoning also makes neighbourhoods slightly more mixed in terms of usage residential and commercial are more muddled up than elsewhere and racially Because there are no zoning laws to force say a bankrupt restaurant to reopen as a restaurant areas change shape quickly At the same time Houston is less segregated racially than any other city bymost measures One should not be overimpressed by this Whites in Houston may be more likely than their peers elsewhere to have had a conversation with someone of a different race in the previous week but that hasnt stopped them heading for the suburbs Much of the racial mixture downtown is of blacks Latinos and Asians the city has Americas secondlargest Vietnamese settlement after southern California But because zoning laws do not enable local groups to keep poor people out for example by requiring that all housing plots be huge Houston remains racially desegregated by American standards This helps draw in immigrant workers creating a pool of labour That leads to the third of Houstons main characteristics which should prove an advantage in the st century racial tolerance Houston looked like a southern town until the s white with a large black minority A generation later its population is roughly onethird white onethird black and slightly over onethird brown Other cities have similar profiles but none went from a biracial to amultiracial city quite so abruptly Even more strikingly it did so peacefully Houston has not had a race riot since For the largest southern city to have gone through the civilrights era and its aftermath without upheaval is a remarkable comment on its politics Minorities have long been fully or overrepresented in the city council county commissions and the Texas state legislature Bob Stein of Rice University argues that unlike other growing cities Houston is reinventing the tradition of a powerful group of civicminded business leaders the fate of whose companies is closely tied to that of the city Ken Lay Enrons chairman is an example He has been the driving force behind the building of two sports stadiums and has a pet project to boost child literacy Rumour has it that he may run for mayor The effect of this sort of civicminded activism showed up in the late s At a time when America was busily abolishing affirmativeaction programmes Houston went the other way it had a new one approved in a citywide referendum For better or worse this showed how racially tolerant it is For how much longer In many ways Houston is thriving because it has kept alive an oldfashioned industrial mode of growth built on cheap land low taxes immigrant labour and unfettered probusiness policies This model may not be enough in the next decades Houston is ugly It was hardly charming to begin with and has pulled down many of its old buildings It may have to pull down even more after recent floods caused billionworth of damage It is also as Al Gore rudely pointed out during the presidential campaign polluted Since cities now have to attract skilled workers with quality of life benefits this is a big problem and not one that can be overcome by cheap housing Business leaders are frantically trying to catch up In an unusual example of bipartisanship a fervently conservative property developer has joined forces with a former member of the Clinton administration to back a m bond issue to plant m trees The Greater Houston Partnership has executed an aboutturn on pollution Having argued last year that new pollution controls damage growth it is now on a crash course to cut ozonecreating emissions as fast as it can If this sudden change of mind is real it poses a tough question about zoning Houston has people an acre compared with in Los Angeles and in New York at the other end of the scale This extraordinary extensiveness is expensive At one point in the early s Houston alone was spending more on roads than any state except California and of course Texas There are doubts about how much further sprawl can go Threequarters of the bestpaid jobs are still on or within the inner ring road Some new suburbs are miles away Can the city continue to burst outwards while attracting the skilled people whose jobs are downtown And surely that means introducing zoning Lastly Houston faces a severe problem in the one area where its national reputation is high education To run his numberone priority Mr Bush picked as secretary of education Rod Paige a former head of the Houston independent school district The president claimed correctly that Mr Paige had overseen substantial improvements in the citys education especially among minorities What he did not say is that these improvements have been nothing like enough Despite successes in individual schools half of all Latinos fail to graduate from high school compared with of whites and of blacks Whites are abandoning Houstons public schools They represent only of pupils are Latino More than a quarter of todays schoolchildren are likely to dropout In a world where a good job depends on having a college degree this is alarming Rice Universitys Mr Klineberg argues that new immigrants from Mexico arrive lagging further behind the rest of the country educationally than did the wave of immigrants in the early s The first wave took several generations to catch up Todays immigrants will have to close a bigger gap more quickly If they do not they may end up in an underclass that could scratch at Houstonsracial harmony This is Houston Can Houston make it The city has experienced the three big transformations that affect America in their purest form the change from a rawmaterial economy to services the change from a biracial to a multiracial place and the moderation of a noholdsbarred probusiness culture to take account of environmental and social costs Elsewhere these changes have occurred over years Houston has lived through them in And the next years will probably be just as dramatic and successful Hold onto those Stetsons Copyright The Economist Newspaper
