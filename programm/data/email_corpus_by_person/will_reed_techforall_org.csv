been focused recently on finalizing the TFA relationships with Smartforce and IverCityCom We will announce the Smartforce donation K eLearning scholarships over three years at a meeting in Boston on November This is a huge gift million in retail value I have been in contact phone and face to face visits with several nonprofit groups in LA involved in local initiatives there Some of these groups are working together and some are not million in value of the Smartforce eLearning courses are reserved for LA and could be utilized by local groups there if they can work together It is my hope that TFA can help encourage that One of the issues of course is identifying other potential cobranding corporationsfoundations that can help bring the necessary dollars to the table Inkind donations have been relatively easy to accumulate Finding the necessary cash is more difficult I do agree with you that Mayor Riordans future plans could be good for TFA Perhaps we can talk by phone in the next day or two to follow through on some of our previous discussions I will be in Washington DC later in the week to meet with the Internet Policy Institute the Pew Foundation and others I have also been following through on some contacts in DC and New York City Again we will need cobranding relationships with s and inkind resources to make this work Will Original Message From Peter Douglas mailto

an executive position running the LA Unified School districts classroom computer program I would think this could be good for TFA How are you coming with the conatcts I gave you PD Saturday November News from Los Angeles in the Los Angeles Times Riordan to Join LA Unified After He Leaves City Hall Mayor In an address to Valley leaders he strongly denounces secession then makes surprising disclosure about plan to take executive post with district By JIM NEWTON Times Staff Writer In his final annual address on the state of the San Fernando Valley Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on Friday delivered his most forceful call ever for that area to remain part of the larger city then surprised the audience by announcing that he will go to work for the Los Angeles Unified School District when he finishes his term in office Speaking to a group of Valley business leaders Riordan denounced secession on political moral and practical grounds warning that it would force a tax hike leave the Valley with uncertain leadership and abandon the citys poor I love the Valley Riordan said I feel that youre part of the family and I dont want you to desert the family The rest of the city needs you You cant abandon the poor It just isnt right Riordans pointed rejection of secession represents a significant escalation in his efforts to head off that politically charged prospecta topic so heated that in a mayoral debate following Riordans speech not one of the six candidates angling for election in April so much as mentioned the word Riordan by contrast tackled the issue headon and in far more confrontational terms than he ever has before Secession Riordan said bluntly is a lousy idea As significant as that pronouncement was however the mayor almost overshadowed it with an offhand personal remark in response to a question after his speech Asked to elaborate on his thoughts about breaking up the school district Riordan let slip that he intends to go to work for LA Unified after he finishes his second term as mayor which ends next summer The mayor who helped elect four of the school boards seven members said he has been in discussions with Supt Roy Romer and has agreed to accept an executive position with the district next year Riordan did not elaborate but in an interview later he said he and the superintendent had agreed that Riordan would run the districts classroom computer program The former Colorado governor who now runs the citys schools was not immediately available for comment At the district Riordan said he will be in charge of working with schools to make effective use of computers in the classroom Riordan who has donated thousands of computers to schools in various parts of the country said the job fit his talents I think this is something Im good at he said I know the experts in the field Riordans postmayoral plans have for months been the object of much speculation Most observers predicted he would do something in the field of education because no topic animates Riordan as much as children and schools But Riordan is a multimillionaire and he will be over when he finishes his second term as mayor He passed up the chance to run for governor in and some friends had predicted he would slow down when he wrapped up his mayoral administration The idea of a quiet retirement however seems to have little appeal for Riordan an energetic and restless man Asked how long he intended to take off between finishing his work as mayor and starting his new job at the school district Riordan responded three or four hours Riordan has held office for nearly eight years and for that entire time has enjoyed the strong support of the San Fernando Valley It was the Valley that helped put him in office in and polls since have shown that though he is popular citywide he enjoys his greatest approval ratings north of the Hollywood Hills As the race to succeed him gathers steam some of the candidates clearly covet Riordans base in the Valley On Friday City Councilman Joel Wachs often invoked the mayors name during a lowenergy debate among the six leading mayoral candidates Among other things Wachs praised Riordans economic development initiatives and his handling of the recently completed negotiations between the city and federal government over the future of the Los Angeles Police Department So effusive was Wachs in his praise of Riordan that eventually businessman Steve Soboroff complained As Soboroff pointed out to the audience Riordan has endorsed his candidacy not Wachs Soboroff suggested that his rival withdraw from the race and back him instead Wachs laughed but did not respond The debatereally more of a panel discussion in which the candidates rarely addressed one another while sitting cheekbyjowl in straightbacked chairsalso was notable as the first joint appearance of the candidates to include state Controller Kathleen Connell the latest contender to join the race Connell used her debut debate performance to stress her determination to bring tough fiscal management to the problems of Los Angeles She addressed issues such as police corruption transportation and the citys business climate in terms of their economic impact arguing that her experience in the private sector and as controller made her the right person to handle that task In other debate highlights City Atty James Hahn and Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa enthusiastically welcomed the signing of the consent decree with the federal government on police reform Connell Wachs and US Rep Xavier Becerra also applauded the deal though in less glowing terms Soboroff was the only candidate to oppose it calling it an abdication of local responsibility

Several of you have seen the announcement today that Enron received notice from Dynegy Inc that it is terminating the merger aggreement between it and Enron In addition Standard and Poors Moody Investors Service and Fitch Inc downgraded Enrons longterm debt to below investment grade Technology For All has been the recipient of significant support from Enron as a national sponsor We are grateful for Enrons support and the support of Ken Lay We acknowledge the enormous credibilty that support has given us to expand our vision and mission We now have direct supportive relationships with Community Technology Centers in US cities including our local TFA affiliates in Houston Denver and Cleveland Ohio We estimate that persons each week are positively impacted by these program partnerships With the Enron announcements today in the press I wanted to inform you of my actions in response to these developments Enrons commitment to Technology For All was a commitment of three items over three years Cash Connectivity on the Enron Network and inkind contributions of hardware andor other services The commitment was to expire at the end of Therefore of the cash commitment has been received by TFA We have received some inkind contributions but never finalized the provision of connectivity on the Enron Network To date continuing connectivity has generously been provided by FYINet a privately owned company of which Scott Yeager and members of his family are the largest stockholders Therefore while significant to TFA the Enron developments will not shutdown our vital mission to bring technology to underserved communities Our vision continues to be focused on using technology as a tool with the disadvantaged and underserved to bring about sustainable and meaningful change in their communities Over the past several weeks as Enron situation has unfolded we have done and are doing several things to preserve our core missional focus In expectation of reduced revenue we have been cutting expenses significantly and will be announcing several layoffs in the next few days I have taken a voluntary reduction in income and Douglas Caldwell has taken a voluntary reduction in income With the assistance of a Capacity Building tool developed by McKinsey Co for the Venture Philanthropy Partners Group out of Washington DC we are in the midst of strategic planning effort that will help us rewrite our business plan This effort will help us focus on the capacity building activities most vital to our core mission and develop a go forward plan We are intensely developing other relationships with corporate and foundation funders that are project specific and results oriented Almost all of my time will be focused on fund raising activites We have several potential relationships under development The diversification of our donor basis is criticial to the future of our mission To set an example for potential donors in addition to the reduction in salary my gifts to TFA equal of my annual income I have named Douglas Caldwell to serve in an expanded position of leadership as the Chief Operating Officer As the COO Douglas now has responsibility and authority for the daytoday operations of Technology For All and also for Technology For AllHouston This decision was made in consultation with Jack Trotter Scott Yeager and Jack Clark As some of you already know Douglas brings many skills to this new role In addition to his numerous contacts with potential funding sources he is able to see the big picture of our common vision while at the same time is also able to drill down to the details required to accomplish it He is also a person who manages resources well While this is always important this is especially important during this time of economic uncertainty We must be good stewards of our available resources It is my recomendation to the TFA Board that we establish advisory boards in each TFA city and at the national level to help carry the TFA banner and to raise the dollars necessary to support our core programs and activies The TFAHouston Board of Directors unanimously affirmed this recomendation for Houston I solicit your support of this recomendation on a national level and your suggestions of persons who may be potential advisory board members We are in the final stages of preparation for a larger three year proposal for a Houston Workforce Development Initiative that will utilize our SmartForce content in collaboration with over of our community program partners It is our intent to pitch this first to Houstons Brown Foundation for a three year commitment The support of our board will be vital to the success of this proposal Mr Valenti I will be calling you and others to assist with this Please call me if you have any questions regarding my plans I look forward to your comments and reflections Regards Will TECHNOLOGY FOR ALL We bring Technology to Underserved Communities wwwtechforallorg William S Reed

been focused recently on finalizing the TFA relationships with Smartforce and IverCityCom We will announce the Smartforce donation K eLearning scholarships over three years at a meeting in Boston on November This is a huge gift million in retail value I have been in contact phone and face to face visits with several nonprofit groups in LA involved in local initiatives there Some of these groups are working together and some are not million in value of the Smartforce eLearning courses are reserved for LA and could be utilized by local groups there if they can work together It is my hope that TFA can help encourage that One of the issues of course is identifying other potential cobranding corporationsfoundations that can help bring the necessary dollars to the table Inkind donations have been relatively easy to accumulate Finding the necessary cash is more difficult I do agree with you that Mayor Riordans future plans could be good for TFA Perhaps we can talk by phone in the next day or two to follow through on some of our previous discussions I will be in Washington DC later in the week to meet with the Internet Policy Institute the Pew Foundation and others I have also been following through on some contacts in DC and New York City Again we will need cobranding relationships with s and inkind resources to make this work Will Original Message From Peter Douglas mailto Sent Saturday November PM To William Reed Email Cc Kenneth L Lay Email Jack Trotter Email Scott Yeager Email John Duncan Email Subject Riordan Los Angeles After leaving office Mayor Riordan will take an executive position running the LA Unified School districts classroom computer program I would think this could be good for TFA How are you coming with the conatcts I gave you PD Saturday November News from Los Angeles in the Los Angeles Times Riordan to Join LA Unified After He Leaves City Hall Mayor In an address to Valley leaders he strongly denounces secession then makes surprising disclosure about plan to take executive post with district By JIM NEWTON Times Staff Writer In his final annual address on the state of the San Fernando Valley Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on Friday delivered his most forceful call ever for that area to remain part of the larger city then surprised the audience by announcing that he will go to work for the Los Angeles Unified School District when he finishes his term in office Speaking to a group of Valley business leaders Riordan denounced secession on political moral and practical grounds warning that it would force a tax hike leave the Valley with uncertain leadership and abandon the citys poor I love the Valley Riordan said I feel that youre part of the family and I dont want you to desert the family The rest of the city needs you You cant abandon the poor It just isnt right Riordans pointed rejection of secession represents a significant escalation in his efforts to head off that politically charged prospecta topic so heated that in a mayoral debate following Riordans speech not one of the six candidates angling for election in April so much as mentioned the word Riordan by contrast tackled the issue headon and in far more confrontational terms than he ever has before Secession Riordan said bluntly is a lousy idea As significant as that pronouncement was however the mayor almost overshadowed it with an offhand personal remark in response to a question after his speech Asked to elaborate on his thoughts about breaking up the school district Riordan let slip that he intends to go to work for LA Unified after he finishes his second term as mayor which ends next summer The mayor who helped elect four of the school boards seven members said he has been in discussions with Supt Roy Romer and has agreed to accept an executive position with the district next year Riordan did not elaborate but in an interview later he said he and the superintendent had agreed that Riordan would run the districts classroom computer program The former Colorado governor who now runs the citys schools was not immediately available for comment At the district Riordan said he will be in charge of working with schools to make effective use of computers in the classroom Riordan who has donated thousands of computers to schools in various parts of the country said the job fit his talents I think this is something Im good at he said I know the experts in the field Riordans postmayoral plans have for months been the object of much speculation Most observers predicted he would do something in the field of education because no topic animates Riordan as much as children and schools But Riordan is a multimillionaire and he will be over when he finishes his second term as mayor He passed up the chance to run for governor in and some friends had predicted he would slow down when he wrapped up his mayoral administration The idea of a quiet retirement however seems to have little appeal for Riordan an energetic and restless man Asked how long he intended to take off between finishing his work as mayor and starting his new job at the school district Riordan responded three or four hours Riordan has held office for nearly eight years and for that entire time has enjoyed the strong support of the San Fernando Valley It was the Valley that helped put him in office in and polls since have shown that though he is popular citywide he enjoys his greatest approval ratings north of the Hollywood Hills As the race to succeed him gathers steam some of the candidates clearly covet Riordans base in the Valley On Friday City Councilman Joel Wachs often invoked the mayors name during a lowenergy debate among the six leading mayoral candidates Among other things Wachs praised Riordans economic development initiatives and his handling of the recently completed negotiations between the city and federal government over the future of the Los Angeles Police Department So effusive was Wachs in his praise of Riordan that eventually businessman Steve Soboroff complained As Soboroff pointed out to the audience Riordan has endorsed his candidacy not Wachs Soboroff suggested that his rival withdraw from the race and back him instead Wachs laughed but did not respond The debatereally more of a panel discussion in which the candidates rarely addressed one another while sitting cheekbyjowl in straightbacked chairsalso was notable as the first joint appearance of the candidates to include state Controller Kathleen Connell the latest contender to join the race Connell used her debut debate performance to stress her determination to bring tough fiscal management to the problems of Los Angeles She addressed issues such as police corruption transportation and the citys business climate in terms of their economic impact arguing that her experience in the private sector and as controller made her the right person to handle that task In other debate highlights City Atty James Hahn and Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa enthusiastically welcomed the signing of the consent decree with the federal government on police reform Connell Wachs and US Rep Xavier Becerra also applauded the deal though in less glowing terms Soboroff was the only candidate to oppose it calling it an abdication of local responsibility
