<26296582.1075843429608.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lgoldseth@svmg.org,2001-04-16 06:20:00,Please review in preparation for todays committee meetingyou know the SVMG Energy Committee plans to discuss variable pricing specifically Severin Borensteins proposal at its next meeting on Monday A copy of his proposal is attached As I indicated at last weeks meeting I believe the SVMG should consider endorsing the proposal with certain conditions for the following reasons It provides the broadest most transparent incentive to reduce consumption precisely during hours of shortage thereby reducing the chances of involuntary curtailments blackouts It creates a demand response to high prices thereby reducing the market power enjoyed by power sellers This may be one of the only factors contributing to a more reasonable stable wholesale price environment if there is no federal intervention It offers a financial opportunity for those users who are able to reduce their demand overall or shift their demand to offpeak periods The following is a strawman draft of an endorsement by SVMG for discussion Monday I would point out that the strawman is silent on the question of whether customers who choose to opt out of variable pricing must be interruptible an issue of concern to some Also I hope to have additional input from Barbara Barkovich before Mondays meeting Thanks Peter Evans Power prices paid by customers must create the incentive to reduce demand during specific hours of supply shortage and high prices This gives the greates possibility of getting through this summer without running up a staggering DWR bill and suffering through frequent blackouts Getting people to reduce demand in response to higher prices would also reduce the market power of sellers We therefore endorse the proposal to price power use above historical levels and rebate for power use reductions below historical levels at the realtime energy price Our support for this concept includes the following conditions Historical consumption levels which would be served under regulated rates would be based on last years use taking into account the customers historical load profile Adjustments would be made for increasesdecreases in number of employees or number of square feet per electrical meter to account for changes in business volume Historical consumption served under regulated rates could be adjusted by a ratio say to to build in some expectation of conservation Participation All customer classes would participate In the absence of real time load data ie residential customers monthly consumption deviations from historical levels would be priced at the monthly average spot price Alternatives for AboveBaseline Use It must be explicitly clear that customers have completely unfettered ability to procure power for their abovehistorical power requirements on their own if they choose to This could include selfgeneration bilateral forward purchases or purchasing at the spot price from the DWR Sunset This approach should automatically terminate at the end of requiring government or regulatory action to extend it RTP proposal doc

Office Equipment Efficiency Program to members of th e Silicon Valley Manufacturers Group Energy Committee This email is in lieu of squeezing onto the Committees Monday Agenda and background for a possible future agenda slot As weve discussed EZ Stars developer David Ensign is in town to to do onsite demonstrations If its possible we would be very grateful if someone announced the San Francisco and Oakland demos mentioned in the attached flyer or pointed people to the flyer on the web at wwwenergysolutioncomoffequipdemoshtml or even pointing people to Mondays SF Chronicle technology column where the program is expected to get plugged David Ensign and I hope to attend Mondays meeting at EPRI as Lynn Morrison Wattstoppers guests Our intent is just to catch up with a few of your members in the flesh instead of just email and to see your process If your format allows for Mr Ensign to be acknowledged in some way it might make the program more tangible in our planned future discussions about the program by your committee I have attached the flyer for the upcoming software demonstrations along with a pdf of the Statefunded Office Equipment Efficiency Program and a summary sheet about

recently developed EZ Star free software that enables systems administrators to easily poll then enable sleep mode for all computer monitors on a LAN This software tool will be a key feature i n US EPAs upcoming national campaign to enable sleep mode for computer monitors The software developer David Ensign is in town next week Apri l to demonstrate the software He is teaming up with the Statefunded Office Equipment Efficiency Program which can PAY organizations an incentive if they enable sleep mode on monitors either through EZ Star or other means This is a chance to see something new and potentially important Californi a is at the leading edge of the national EPA campaign and the SF Bay Area is the first place the software is being significantly marketed All four organizations who saw this demo weeks ago are planning to use the software East Bay Municipal Utility District computers the California Energy Commission machines Mills College machines and East Bay Regional Parks machines OFFICE EQUIPMENT EFFICIENCY PROGRAM Highlights Energy Solutions Statefunded Office Equipment Efficiency Program provi des an easy and environmentally friendly way to reduce energy use by computers and other office equipment this end use is the fastest growing part of mos t organizations energy bills Also by being noticeable to nearly all st aff in the organization the program demonstrates a commitment to conserve energy to those inside and outside the organization StateFunded Program Energy Solutions wwwenergysolutioncom has been funded by the State to offer free office equipment efficiency services to businesses and institutions in the PGE service territory The State funded this program to reduce peak electricity use and to help avert rolling blackouts in Summe r Enable ENERGY STAR Features FOR FREE The Office Equipment Efficiency Program makes it easy to enable the builti n energy savings features ie sleep settings of ENERGY STAR offic e equipment especially computer monitors The program offers free enabling services incentive payments to the site and support for using the US EPA s new networkbased enabling tool We estimate that this NO COST measure can save your organization per year per computer monitor enabled Further since nearly every employee notices this change and receives a use r awareness brochure this measure raises the energyawareness of staff Blank computer screens at vacant desks can serve to remind staff that energ y costs are an issue that the organization is taking seriously Deep Discounts on Smart Hardware The program also offers energy saving hardware bought down to belowwholesale prices by using the State funding We can provide smart power strips that turn off desk lights personal printers etc through a desktop occupancy sensor This is a item that we subsidize to each And for private offices we offer wallswitches with occupancy sensor s to turn off overhead lighting a product sold for through the program Either of these items should save your organization more than per year in energy costs User Awareness Campaign Finally the program offers employee awareness literature to encourage conservation and to dispel common myths Two common myths are that scr een savers save energy and that leaving your computer on all the time save s money or makes computers last longer This programs nocost lowcost measures can provide an effective first step toward reducing your organizations rising energy costs or they ca n compliment a comprehensive energy strategy by addressing an oftenoverlooke d power use In either case the services would be part of any organization s effort to take advantage of the Governors new incentives to reduce ener gy use by this summer The program expires June and the programs hardware offer may be gon e before then For more information or to enable your own computer monitor now please check out the programs web pages at wwwenergysolutioncomoffequip If we can provide any further information on the program in the meantime please call me at ext Thank you for your attention on this matter Terry OSullivan For computers the program only enables ENERGY STAR sleep settings

Conservation On Thursday June our Board Chair Dr James Woody signed on to the Energy Conservation Declaration of Action on behalf of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group Sponsored by the Bay Area Council the Declaration represents an outward commitment to conservation and the quality of life and economic vitality of California More than business organizations and CEOs signed on to help make this campaign a success Load Management On June John Wilson of the California Energy Commission along with his consultants John Flory and Mike OSheasy presented the CEC proposed RTP Tariff to the Energy Committee and asked for our endorsement Members of the Committee thoroughly reviewed the proposal and conducted case studies The Committee submitted three main caveats to the CEC upon which our endorsement depended The CEC was very receptive to our concerns and amended the Tariff language to the Committees satisfaction If adopted we are encouraged that many SVMG member companies can benefit from participating in the Real Time Pricing program due to our influence Final adjustments to the language are being prepared and the CEC is expecting that this item will be heard by the California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday June We will let you know how this unfolds After months of effort we have succeeded in putting together a Blackout Notification System that will provide California employers residents and public safety officers with adequate time to respond to an impending rolling blackout This system provides not only a hour advanced warning before a blackout could occur but also includes and hour notices that blackouts might happen due to predicted hot weather conditions andor a lack of energy supply or planned and unplanned maintenance at generation facilities The proactive approach will include a system by which residents and employers can have their extensive contact information such as emails pagers and cell phones listed in a database This will help us better prepare for a blackout with more adequate time to power down assembly lines projects and computers and power up emergency generators We can also help prevent blackouts by taking early action Generation Transmission Included in the attached Energy Matrix is a listing of the different infrastructure projects that the SVMG has helped to endorse There is also a link to our website where you can obtain more information on the projects You will also find a section that provides an update to project status The SVMG will continue to review and support needed infrastructure projects as they are presented to us Legislation Regulation For the past three weeks John Redding Justin Bradley and Derek Naten have been representing the SVMG in a series of meetings in Sacramento with a broad coalition of consumer businessindustrial environmentalists and labor groups and Southern California Edison Company to influence a proposed regional energy plan Discussion convened daily in an effort to solve the financial issues surrounding the SCE and DWR undercollections SVMG has also been working with business groups to leverage our strength for a fair and comprehensive energy plan for California that would consist of an equitable proportional allocation of costs of utility and DWR undercollections between all customer classes the restoration of a market with customer choice through direct access to bilateral electricity contracts and the removal of barriers to onsite generation We are currently stalled at this stage of the negotiations due to the enormous uncertainty of the terms and conditions of the DWR contract portfolio We are encouraged however and will keep you updated On June Justin Bradley our Energy Director testified in front of the House Budget Committee in Washington DC advocating for research and development funding through the National Energy Reliability Initiative Through his efforts we are aiming to influence a national energy policy that will help California as we continue to look forward at our energy situation One way we will do this is to maintain a working and regular relationship with our federal representatives Justin will be facilitating a biweekly dialogue with representatives Honda Lofgren and Eshoo to exchange information about legislation and policy with our Legislative Subcommittee We will let you know more when Justin returns

Agenda which Includes Recent Sponsorship of National Commission on Federal Election Reform The Hewlett Foundation today announced a million energy initiative designed to add a new dimension to regional and national energy policy issues The Foundations energy initiative will focus on energy supply and conservation issues in California and the Intermountain West and support the development of comprehensive balanced and practical national energy policy options By sponsoring research and analysis of contemporary energy issues the Foundations objective is to enable a wide spectrum of research institutions and organizations to bring new ideas and analysis into the energy debate The Hewlett Foundation Board is very excited to sponsor a comprehensive look at the energy resource challenges facing the United States said Walter B Hewlett Chairman of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation Board of Directors Too often critical public policy questions such as the energy debate are polarized before the discussion begins This project is designed to fill a number of information gaps in the debate and seek to establish a center ground of ideas that respond to the need for a sensible longterm energy policy in the United States Over the next two years the Foundations energy initiative will help develop energy policy options by sponsoring new environmental research economic and policy analysis and experimental conservation projects The scope of programs envisioned under this initiative will address both energy supply and conservation challenges and apply practical costbenefit analysis at the intersection of energy economics and environmental science The Foundation will include diverse stakeholders such as the energy industry environmental groups and other NGOs academic institutions and think tanks state and federal policymakers and consumers in this process For too long there has been too much noise and not enough thoughtful discussion about the difficult choices that policymakers must confront in solving Americas energy problems said US Senator Dianne Feinstein DCalifornia I applaud the Hewlett Foundation for its effort in sponsoring important research and in providing an important new venue to address these complicated issues in a nonpartisan framework The Hewlett Foundation has a strong reputation for undertaking important public policy work said US Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell RColorado It is my hope that this project leads to some creative solutions to our energy supply and conservation challenges I look forward to watching this effort evolve into an important source of information in the energy policy debate in the near future Recently the Hewlett Foundation was a leading sponsor of the bipartisan National Commission on Federal Election Reform On Tuesday July the Commission published a comprehensive series of policy recommendations to improve voter registration and election practices across the nation The Hewlett Foundation takes pride in supporting bipartisan or multipartisan approaches to controversial public policy issues said Paul Brest President of the Hewlett Foundation In the political arena controversial issues tend to push interest groups into conventional alignments The energy initiative is designed to inform this polarized debate with reliable data and sound analysis We hope to generate new ideas that challenge the conventional dichotomy between energy and conservation This project does not end at research Rather we intend to provide a forum for diverse points of view to assemble and address Americas energy policy challenges The Hewlett Foundation has begun selecting academic institutions other foundations think tanks trade groups and other participants to define the specific scope of various project elements The Foundation will not entertain unsolicited proposals for this project As the project advances scientific reports analysis and other information will be disseminated to regional and national policymakers and interest groups Additionally project updates and additional energyrelated information will be posted on a website wwwhewlettenergyorg

Conservation On Thursday June our Board Chair Dr James Woody signed on to the Energy Conservation Declaration of Action on behalf of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group Sponsored by the Bay Area Council the Declaration represents an outward commitment to conservation and the quality of life and economic vitality of California More than business organizations and CEOs signed on to help make this campaign a success Load Management On June John Wilson of the California Energy Commission along with his consultants John Flory and Mike OSheasy presented the CEC proposed RTP Tariff to the Energy Committee and asked for our endorsement Members of the Committee thoroughly reviewed the proposal and conducted case studies The Committee submitted three main caveats to the CEC upon which our endorsement depended The CEC was very receptive to our concerns and amended the Tariff language to the Committees satisfaction If adopted we are encouraged that many SVMG member companies can benefit from participating in the Real Time Pricing program due to our influence Final adjustments to the language are being prepared and the CEC is expecting that this item will be heard by the California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday June We will let you know how this unfolds After months of effort we have succeeded in putting together a Blackout Notification System that will provide California employers residents and public safety officers with adequate time to respond to an impending rolling blackout This system provides not only a hour advanced warning before a blackout could occur but also includes and hour notices that blackouts might happen due to predicted hot weather conditions andor a lack of energy supply or planned and unplanned maintenance at generation facilities The proactive approach will include a system by which residents and employers can have their extensive contact information such as emails pagers and cell phones listed in a database This will help us better prepare for a blackout with more adequate time to power down assembly lines projects and computers and power up emergency generators We can also help prevent blackouts by taking early action Generation Transmission Included in the attached Energy Matrix is a listing of the different infrastructure projects that the SVMG has helped to endorse There is also a link to our website where you can obtain more information on the projects You will also find a section that provides an update to project status The SVMG will continue to review and support needed infrastructure projects as they are presented to us Legislation Regulation For the past three weeks John Redding Justin Bradley and Derek Naten have been representing the SVMG in a series of meetings in Sacramento with a broad coalition of consumer businessindustrial environmentalists and labor groups and Southern California Edison Company to influence a proposed regional energy plan Discussion convened daily in an effort to solve the financial issues surrounding the SCE and DWR undercollections SVMG has also been working with business groups to leverage our strength for a fair and comprehensive energy plan for California that would consist of an equitable proportional allocation of costs of utility and DWR undercollections between all customer classes the restoration of a market with customer choice through direct access to bilateral electricity contracts and the removal of barriers to onsite generation We are currently stalled at this stage of the negotiations due to the enormous uncertainty of the terms and conditions of the DWR contract portfolio We are encouraged however and will keep you updated On June Justin Bradley our Energy Director testified in front of the House Budget Committee in Washington DC advocating for research and development funding through the National Energy Reliability Initiative Through his efforts we are aiming to influence a national energy policy that will help California as we continue to look forward at our energy situation One way we will do this is to maintain a working and regular relationship with our federal representatives Justin will be facilitating a biweekly dialogue with representatives Honda Lofgren and Eshoo to exchange information about legislation and policy with our Legislative Subcommittee We will let you know more when Justin returns Energy Committee News Please join us in welcoming the new cochair of our Energy Committee Joe Desmond President and CEO of Infotility has nearly years of experience in the energy field He is

the following information may be of great interest to many of you Please dont miss the following opportunities by disregarding this message Terry was at our committee meeting yesterday as an observer and was very pleased He has programs that are free and that can be subsidized by different groups His phone number and email are below Thanks Laura Original Message From Terry OSullivan mailto Sent Sunday April AM To Subject EZ Star Software Tool and Office Equipment Efficiency Program Laura Goldseth Thanks for offering to convey the attached materials about US DOEs EZ Star software tool and the Office Equipment Efficiency Program to members of th e Silicon Valley Manufacturers Group Energy Committee This email is in lieu of squeezing onto the Committees Monday Agenda and background for a possible future agenda slot As weve discussed EZ Stars developer David Ensign is in town to to do onsite demonstrations If its possible we would be very grateful if someone announced the San Francisco and Oakland demos mentioned in the attached flyer or pointed people to the flyer on the web at wwwenergysolutioncomoffequipdemoshtml or even pointing people to Mondays SF Chronicle technology column where the program is expected to get plugged David Ensign and I hope to attend Mondays meeting at EPRI as Lynn Morrison Wattstoppers guests Our intent is just to catch up with a few of your members in the flesh instead of just email and to see your process If your format allows for Mr Ensign to be acknowledged in some way it might make the program more tangible in our planned future discussions about the program by your committee I have attached the flyer for the upcoming software demonstrations along with a pdf of the Statefunded Office Equipment Efficiency Program and a summary sheet about EZ STAR The rest of this email includes a brief description of the EZ Star software tool and a somewhat generic email abou t the Office Equipment Efficiency Program EZ Star US Department of Energy has recently developed EZ Star free software that enables systems administrators to easily poll then enable sleep mode for all computer monitors on a LAN This software tool will be a key feature i n US EPAs upcoming national campaign to enable sleep mode for computer monitors The software developer David Ensign is in town next week Apri l to demonstrate the software He is teaming up with the Statefunded Office Equipment Efficiency Program which can PAY organizations an incentive if they enable sleep mode on monitors either through EZ Star or other means This is a chance to see something new and potentially important Californi a is at the leading edge of the national EPA campaign and the SF Bay Area is the first place the software is being significantly marketed All four organizations who saw this demo weeks ago are planning to use the software East Bay Municipal Utility District computers the California Energy Commission machines Mills College machines and East Bay Regional Parks machines OFFICE EQUIPMENT EFFICIENCY PROGRAM Highlights Energy Solutions Statefunded Office Equipment Efficiency Program provi des an easy and environmentally friendly way to reduce energy use by computers and other office equipment this end use is the fastest growing part of mos t organizations energy bills Also by being noticeable to nearly all st aff in the organization the program demonstrates a commitment to conserve energy to those inside and outside the organization StateFunded Program Energy Solutions wwwenergysolutioncom has been funded by the State to offer free office equipment efficiency services to businesses and institutions in the PGE service territory The State funded this program to reduce peak electricity use and to help avert rolling blackouts in Summe r Enable ENERGY STAR Features FOR FREE The Office Equipment Efficiency Program makes it easy to enable the builti n energy savings features ie sleep settings of ENERGY STAR offic e equipment especially computer monitors The program offers free enabling services incentive payments to the site and support for using the US EPA s new networkbased enabling tool We estimate that this NO COST measure can save your organization per year per computer monitor enabled Further since nearly every employee notices this change and receives a use r awareness brochure this measure raises the energyawareness of staff Blank computer screens at vacant desks can serve to remind staff that energ y costs are an issue that the organization is taking seriously Deep Discounts on Smart Hardware The program also offers energy saving hardware bought down to belowwholesale prices by using the State funding We can provide smart power strips that turn off desk lights personal printers etc through a desktop occupancy sensor This is a item that we subsidize to each And for private offices we offer wallswitches with occupancy sensor s to turn off overhead lighting a product sold for through the program Either of these items should save your organization more than per year in energy costs User Awareness Campaign Finally the program offers employee awareness literature to encourage conservation and to dispel common myths Two common myths are that scr een savers save energy and that leaving your computer on all the time save s money or makes computers last longer This programs nocost lowcost measures can provide an effective first step toward reducing your organizations rising energy costs or they ca n compliment a comprehensive energy strategy by addressing an oftenoverlooke d power use In either case the services would be part of any organization s effort to take advantage of the Governors new incentives to reduce ener gy use by this summer The program expires June and the programs hardware offer may be gon e before then For more information or to enable your own computer monitor now please check out the programs web pages at wwwenergysolutioncomoffequip If we can provide any further information on the program in the meantime please call me at ext Thank you for your attention on this matter Terry OSullivan For computers the program only enables ENERGY STAR sleep settings
