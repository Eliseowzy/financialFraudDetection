has been issued OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions s tarting September th This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bi ds exist to solve congestion whether local or zonal The OOMC as I understand it reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols The formu la is based on the replacement reserve clearing price which currently is zero This is because the replacement reserve market is nonexistent An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o ut this week per Mark Patterson The second component of this option is OOME This is a request for actua l energy related to the OOMC option The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price as mentioned in the p

Protocols Here is the problem the head of Ercot Market Operations John Adams interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating When Ercot disp atchers had issued an OOMC they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid We explained to them on numerous occasions that we dont believe OOMC mea ns run If they wanted us to run then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component I asked my employees to clarify with Er cot whether we were being asked to run yes or no When instructed to r un by Ercot we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal c as we were previously under OOMC orders I sent at least three emails to my Ercot rep Mark Patterson regarding th is issue I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er cots intrepretation was correct For all of the times that we ran at their request we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal c rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price a penalty for Resource Imbalance For example in the early morning hours we woul d receive as little as for electricity that cost to generate Mark also mentioned that when they said run they expected us to sell to someo ne else or just generate into the imbalance Mark told me dont worry you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo st money Here is my view OOMC does not mean run It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls much like replacement responsive reserve and nonspinning Ercots interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations a group supposedly unconcerned with price If OOMC means to run then why would the protocols contemplate or need OO ME They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME This is basically the disagre ement This could very well be a issue for Frontera Why would anyone generate for and dump to the imbalance mkt at in ho pes of filing for a breakeven Ridiculous I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had no comment on whether OOMC means to generate Mark Patterson now also has no comme nt Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo sure on the OOM capacity payment I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs the imbalance price we will receive I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant in respons e to an OOMC until we receive an OOME instruction This has compelled E rcot to deploy an OOME request to us because they need to have us online to control local congestion Would this not be an omission that their vie w was incorrect Section says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern or Ercot is not in compli ance with the Protocols The latter is in effect Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us or give us an OOME de ployment unless we are already runnnig I think that this is a softwar e issue not a protocol issue We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett led Once we have been OOMCd we will start to gen Once we reach full load we will request an OOME If they dont comply we will shut down the unit Ercot said that it was entirely reasonable that we would re quest to be compensated in the form of an OOME The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in struction every minutes Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr uction on a regular basis Finally I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices via OOME or force Ercot into a corner It just is not the right economic en vironment to generate for and sell for

financia l option that can be purchased as hedge against zonal congestion There is no physical requirement for the TCR in that you do not have to physically schedule to receive the benefit of the TCR There will be an auction on or about the th of February and the full zonal implementation will tak e place February The tentative schedule is as follows Distribute draft TCR White Paper Review and edit draft TCR White Paper Distribute TCR White Paper to WMS WMS Meeting vote on PRR TAC Meeting Board Meeting ERCOT issues notice of TCR Auction First effective date of TCRs and direct assignment of CSC Con gestion Costs File TCRwhitepaperrevdoc Capacity Auction The capacity auction workshops have begun to rework that capacity rule and problems experienced with the last round There was an initial discussion on the problems that were experienced with credit and ho w the standard was oneway and the buyers of capacity were left without rec ourse There was a subsequent conference call with the credit professional s to discuss the issues I did not participate and there will be an addit ional meeting on the th The purpose of the shortterm meeting are to re ctify issues such as credit and documents prior to the March and July auctions Substantive issues such as the actual products zone determinati on and the auction process will be part of a rulemaking prior to the Septem ber auction which includes annual products Protocol Implementation ERCOT is in the process of determining what shoul d be included in the Phase II design which will begin January There is a priority list that is currently under review by ERCOT vendors to deter mine lead times of Phase II items in an attempt to deliver Phase II items A SAP Parviz Adib from MOD stressed that there are certain issues that the PUCT expects to be addressed in Phase II Issues that do not require major system changes might still be doable in Phase II if the PRR Process is sta rted immediately There is a placeholder in the Protocols related to BULs and loads acting as resources Mechanism for Simultaneous Procurement of Ancillary Services The PUCT ha s expressed concern that there could be price reversals associated with the ancillary services market if it is assumed that the various ancillary ser vices have different levels of value to the market The Board had approve d a contingency plan to allow price modifications in the early markets how ever the plan has not been implemented The WMS discussed at length the issue of simultaneously clearing all three markets nonspinning regulati on and responsive reserve A task force was formed to initially identify the principles for developing a mechanism for simultaneous procurement of a ncillary services issue It was suggested that a consultant be hired to de velop Protocol language once the principles are identified The first task force meeting was cancelled and has not been rescheduled DemandSide Task Force Jay Zarnikau reported on activities of the Demand Side Task Force that is addressing Balancing Up Load BUL Market Issues an d other demandside issues The PUCT expects the full functionality to be in place on January The DSTF met last on October st third meeti ng The DSTF completed a draft status report on DemandSide Resources and Demand Responsiveness It was noted that the work of the DSTF is not comp lete and has not been approved by any ERCOT Committee or the Board Howeve r ERCOT was required to file a report on these issues in the STF Report The report reviews the policy considerations that have prompted interest in the demand side of ERCOTs market reviews the PUCTs directive reviews t he role of demandside resources in ERCOTs markets and identifies the iss ues and impediments that the DSTF is presently addressing It also summari zes the options discussed by the DSTF to date The PUCT staff has suggeste d that ERCOT hire a consultant such as Eric Hirsch to provide more resour ces for this effort The group expects to wrap up BUL issues and address d irect load control issues at its next meeting Unit Specific Deployments At the next WMS meeting October there will be a discussion regarding unit specific deployments and ERCOT will di scuss the issues and the difficult that participants are having to meet the ramp rates of the deployments The WMS will develop a list of issues and case studies for ERCOT to discuss The WMS also briefly discussed PRR related to defining OOME as an Instructed Deviation

please ERCOT Questions OOMC OOME Here are a few additional points I spoke with Ken Saathoff at ERCOT last week he is the director of technic al operations and he agreed that an OOMC instruction is essentially a be ready instruction and an additional OOME or another type of unit specific instruction is necessary for the plant to deploy He is John Adams boss so there is a disconnect between the two levels In addition to Kent I spok e to Mark Walker the senior corporate counsel regarding payment or lack th ereof and he suggested that the only method would be to dispute the settlem ent statement and use that process Going forward however that is not an effective mechanism due to the delay in payment and the necessity to prove your cost structure In speaking with Forney a few minutes

Christi L CcGilbertsmith Doug Baughman Edward D Miller Jeffrey Forney Jo hn M SubjectErcot Questions OOMC OOME Forwarded as discussed Doug Gilbert Smith has asked that your group draft a complaint to the PUCT regarding this misinterpretation of the Protocols by the ERCOT ISO which effectively requires a generator called on for the OOMC ancillary service to run its plant and sidesteps the obligation to pa y an OOME price component when the plants output is utilized by ERCOT Th e OOMC compensation is currently negligible and recovery of actual costs u nder Protocols Sec may take a long time and the OOME compensa tion has various problems as well the more ERCOT calls on a plant for OOME the the lesser the OOME price paid Protocols Sec Heat Ra te value decreases and plants directed to provide say MWs of OOM COOME are not allowed to generate above MWs in an interval thus runn ing the plant economically at a lower heat rate to sell the excess in the marketplace The Frontera plant a customer of EPMI acting as QSE is locat ed such that ERCOT is and will be consistently telling the plant via its QS E to provide OOMC to produce energy going north on a line in South Texas Doug says we should advocate to the PUC that plants in such a position sh ould be Reliability Must Run RMR and be paid at an adequate premium for their support of the system reliability I noted to you as well that this is likely to be a dispute with ERCOT over the interpretation of the Protocols conducted under Protocols Section and we would appreciate any reg group efforts toward preparation for iinit iating such dispute Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tom orrow even if ERCOT tells us their QSE that it should be dispatched Thus we are caught in the middle The legitimate bases for not complying with a n ERCOT dispatch instruction are stated in Protocols Section thr eat to safety risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment or otherwise is not in compliance with these Protocols Though the Protocols Sections seem to recognize as to other capacity oriented ancillary service pr oducts that it is generating capacity available but not energy delivered t o the grid I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC The Operating Gui des definition of OOMC page seems to recognize this however and Secti on B of the ERCOT Market Guide p Feb recognizes the distinc tion between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the positi on stated by John Forney below Sorry for the long email I was trying to provide a statting point for y our group Original Message From Forney John M SentWednesday November PM ToPortz David Gilbertsmith Doug SubjectErcot Questions David I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation Frontera has been issued OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions s tarting September th This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bi ds exist to solve congestion whether local or zonal The OOMC as I understand it reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols The formu la is based on the replacement reserve clearing price which currently is zero This is because the replacement reserve market is nonexistent An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o ut this week per Mark Patterson The second component of this option is OOME This is a request for actua l energy related to the OOMC option The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price as mentioned in the p rotocols So the OOMCOOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component I think that this is the s pirit of the OOMs as mentioned in Section of the Protocols Here is the problem the head of Ercot Market Operations John Adams interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating When Ercot disp atchers had issued an OOMC they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid We explained to them on numerous occasions that we dont believe OOMC mea ns run If they wanted us to run then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component I asked my employees to clarify with Er cot whether we were being asked to run yes or no When instructed to r un by Ercot we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal c as we were previously under OOMC orders I sent at least three emails to my Ercot rep Mark Patterson regarding th is issue I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er cots intrepretation was correct For all of the times that we ran at their request we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal c rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price a penalty for Resource Imbalance For example in the early morning hours we woul d receive as little as for electricity that cost to generate Mark also mentioned that when they said run they expected us to sell to someo ne else or just generate into the imbalance Mark told me dont worry you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo st money Here is my view OOMC does not mean run It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls much like replacement responsive reserve and nonspinning Ercots interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations a group supposedly unconcerned with price If OOMC means to run then why would the protocols contemplate or need OO ME They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME This is basically the disagre ement This could very well be a issue for Frontera Why would anyone generate for and dump to the imbalance mkt at in ho pes of filing for a breakeven Ridiculous I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had no comment on whether OOMC means to generate Mark Patterson now also has no comme nt Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo sure on the OOM capacity payment I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs the imbalance price we will receive I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant in respons e to an OOMC until we receive an OOME instruction This has compelled E rcot to deploy an OOME request to us because they need to have us online to control local congestion Would this not be an omission that their vie w was incorrect Section says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern or Ercot is not in compli ance with the Protocols The latter is in effect Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us or give us an OOME de ployment unless we are already runnnig I think that this is a softwar e issue not a protocol issue We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett led Once we have been OOMCd we will start to gen Once we reach full load we will request an OOME If they dont comply we will shut down the unit Ercot said that it was entirely reasonable that we would re quest to be compensated in the form of an OOME The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in struction every minutes Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr uction on a regular basis Finally I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices via OOME or force Ercot into a corner It just is not the right economic en vironment to generate for and sell for Further operations pers onell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for forcing them to OOME our plant Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run If you agree with me what is our next step I need to move aggressively on this issue Thanks JForney
