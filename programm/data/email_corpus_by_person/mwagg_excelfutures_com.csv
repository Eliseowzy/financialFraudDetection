Some evidence that the gene pool may need a little chlorine Sign in a gas station Coke cents Two for a dollar I was signing the receipt for my credit card purchase when the clerk noticed that I had never signed my name on the back of the credit card She informed me that she could not complete the transaction unless the card was signed When I asked why she explained that it was necessary to compare the signature on the credit card with the signature I just signed on the receipt So I signed the credit card in front of her She carefully compared that signature to the one I signed on the receipt As luck would have it they matched Warning At a grocery store in San Jose they have new credit cardbank card readers at the checkout stands If you dont know how to orient your card to swipe it

teacher commented that the next day would be the shortest day of the year My lab partner became visibly excited cheering and clapping I explained to her that the amount of daylight changes not the actual amount of time Needless to say she was very disappointed Idiots In Food Services My daughter went to a local Taco Bell and ordered a taco She asked the individual behind the counter for minimal lettuce He said he was sorry but they only had iceberg Idiots Do Math A coworker was telling us about her sister who was coming to visit her for the holidays Someone asked how old her sister was at which she paused thought for a bit and then answered Shes half as old as I am thats how I always remember So someone else okay it was me said Thats neat So every year that you age she only ages half a
