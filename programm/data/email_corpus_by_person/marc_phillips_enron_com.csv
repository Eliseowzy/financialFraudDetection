facilities authorized by a Permit by RuleStandard Exemption much the same as is required for any other type of permit The TNRCC Sunset Bill contains language limiting the time that such facilities may operate without NSR authorization of some sort The Senate Committee Substitute SCS for HB is a little stricter than the version passed by the House but both versions did contain grandfathered facility permitting provisions and it is safe to assume that the final version will also If this version passes you will have one additional year to apply for a Voluntary Emissions Reduction Permit VERP If your facility is a pipeline facility the TNRCC will require no more than a reduction in NOx and that reduction can be averaged for several facilities in the same area covered in one permit Note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists particularly Cindy Morphew of TxOGA and Celina Romero of ATINGP that it looks as though we will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permitted without having to use todays BACT This memo summarizes the SCS provisions for your information This is NOT actual bill language Ive TRIED to make it easier to read Note that these provisions may be changed somewhat if the House does not concur in all of the changes made by the Senate and the bill goes to Conference In addition we expect a strong attempt to amend the bill on the Senate floor to require shutdown on September of grandfathered facilities that do not have a pending permit application If that attempt is successful the opportunity to apply for a VERP will be gone on September The memo also recaps previous recommendations to you regarding the current opportunity to claim historical Permits by Rule Standard Exemptions as a means of permitting a grandfathered facility I am not certain how long this opportunity will continue to exist TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE YOU CAN In addition Ive appended some information on year old BACT for gasfired IC engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying to get a VERP now PROVISIONS OF SCS FOR HB PRIOR TO SENATE FLOOR DEBATE Sec PERMIT REQUIRED a Any grandfathered facility that does not have an application pending for a new source review permit or other authorization other than a federal operating permit and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown as provided in Section may not emit air contaminants on or after September if the facility is located in a nonattainment area or September if the facility is located in an attainment area b Any grandfathered facility that does not have a permit or other authorization under this chapter other than a federal operating permit permit may not emit air contaminants on or after September if the facility is located in a nonattainment area or September if the facility is located in an attainment area c Facilities eligible for a Small Business Stationary Source Permit are subject to the permitting deadlines in Section Sec NOTICE OF SHUTDOWN a A notice of shutdown to allow operation of a grandfathered facility beyond the deadlines of a must be filed with the commission before the applicable deadline b A notice under this section shall include the date the facility intends to cease operating an inventory of the type and amount of emissions that will be eliminated when the facility ceases to operate and any other necessary and relevant information the commission by rule deems appropriate GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO PERMITS UNDER AND a The commission shall grant a permit under this section if from the information available to the commission including information presented at any public hearing or through written comment the commission finds that there is no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravene the intent of this chapter including protection of the publics health and physical property b If the commission finds that the emissions from the facility will not comply with Subsection c the commission may not grant the permit under this section c A person planning the modification of a facility previously permitted under this section must comply with new source permitting requirements before modifying d The commission may adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer this section e If an applicant omits any relevant facts or submits incorrect information in an application the applicant shall submit the relevant facts or correct the information no later than days after discovering the error If while processing the application the commission determines that additional information is necessary to evaluate or to take final action on the application the commission may request the information and set a reasonable deadline for a response Failure to comply with the deadline for the response will result in the application being returned to the applicant Sec EXISTING FACILITY PERMIT a The owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may apply for a permit to operate the facility under this section b The commission shall grant a permit under this section if from the information available to the commission including information presented at any public hearing or through written comment the commission finds that the application is filed before September and the facility will use an air pollution control method at least as effective as year old BACT or is filed before the applicable deadline of a and the facility will use current BACT c The commission may issue an existing facility flexible permit for some or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site Permits issued under this subsection shall follow the same permit issuance modification and renewal procedures as existing facility permits Sec SMALL BUSINESS STATIONARY SOURCE PERMIT a Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business stationary source and are not required by commission rule to submit an annual emissions inventory report may apply for a permit under this section before September b Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business stationary source that does not have an application pending for a new source review permit or other authorization other than a federal operating permit and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown may not emit air contaminants on or after September Sec ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITY PERMIT Special provisions for permitting grandfathered electric generating facilities are not outlined in this memo Sec AUTHORIZATION FOR PIPELINE FACILITIES a The commission by rule shall establish the procedures for applications for grandfathered processing treating compression or pumping facilities connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline b Based on a prioritization by the commission as necessary to meet local regional and statewide air quality needs related directly or indirectly to federal air quality standards the commission may require up to a reduction of the hourly emission rates of NOx and VOC from reciprocating internal combustion engines subject to this section For facilities other than reciprocating internal combustion engines that are connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline the commission may consider requiring hourly emissions rate reductions of up to for NOx and for VOC The commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than in other areas but no more than percent reductions in the hourly rate may be required in any area c The commission shall allow for a single permit for all facilities connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline allow for required reductions for facilities under this section to be achieved at one facility or averaged among more than one facility and located in the same local regional or statewide areas designated by the commission under Subsection b for purposes of emission averaging allow emission reductions achieved from grandfathered since September and allow an owner or operator to apply for separate permits under this section for discrete and separate facilities connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline d Facilities authorized by this section shall be considered permitted under this chapter CURRENT OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM A PERMIT BY RULE TO PERMIT A GRANDFATHERED FACILITY TNRCC has interpreted its rules to allow operators to permit grandfathered facilities using any applicable Permit by Rule including those previously referred to as Standard Exemptions For instance old Standard Exemption effective May was for Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than hp and engine trains of less than hp total and can be used to permit any such engines For clarification on this particular exemption the language used by staff in proposing this exemption to the Texas Air Control Board in was as follows Engines smaller than hp are quite numerous and are not considered a substantial source unless joined together IN SERIES emphasis added to form an engine train Engine trains of less than hp are not considered a substantial source Because control technology for NOx emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited it is doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permit system at this time Exemptions From Permits Procedures and Justification for Exemptions signed Charles R Barden PE Executive Secretary Texas Air Control Board May A list of the Historical Standard Exemptions is available on the TNRCC Website at airnsrpermitsoldselistindexhtml airnsrpermitsoldselistindexhtml In applying these Permits by Rule be sure to check the corresponding Exemption Preambles if any for any applicable General Conditions TNRCC has asked that we document such permitting of grandfathered facilities by PI AND a simple notification cover letter to them so that they will have a record that the facilities have been permitted and are no longer considered to be grandfathered The registration will buy you a letter of acknowledgement that you have claimed the permit by rule dont use the term exemption in any correspondence for these engines CORRESPONDENCE WITH TNRCC ON YEAR OLD BACT FOR GAS ENGINES AND TURBINES From Celina Romero Sent Monday December PM To Cc Subject Response to Teleconference I believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the TRNCC will provide to us regarding the development of guidelines for year BACT for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the VERP program The last piece of information is an email that I am forwarding to you with this email It is an email from John Steib to which he attaches an email from Jim Linville In response to a request from us Jim Linville sets forth in his email an example of a large engine with emissions in the gram per horsepower hour range that cannot reduce emissions to the gram level and what the owneroperator of that engine must demonstrate in order to obtain a VERP permit Remember that in order to be included in the TNRCCs January report to the legislature a letter of intent or application for a VERP should be filed with the TNRCC on or before next Thursday December To summarize we have obtained the following policies from the TNRCC Grandfathered internal combustion engines of less than horsepower can be authorized by Standard Exemption No effective December regardless of the level of emissions from those facilities See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September and Drakes letter to me dated October Grandfathered engine trains of less than horsepower or a portion of an engine train up to horsepower may be authorized under Standard Exemption No December so long as each engine in the train does not exceed horsepower See my letter to James Randall dated November and Randalls letter to me dated November Grandfathered turbines of less than horsepower may be authorized by Standard Exemption No dated December regardless of the level of emissions See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September and Drakes letter to me dated October Grandfathered engines and turbines that are able to be controlled to the gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review See James Randalls letter to me dated November Grandfathered engines and turbines that are not able to be controlled to the gram range may be permittable under a VERP if there is test data to validate the old premodification and new postmodification emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved Also needed would be a representation of the cost of the controls and even though additional modifications are available the additional cost is prohibitive See Jim Randalls letter to me dated November and the email attached hereto I hope all of this is helpful I have forwarded to you copies of the referenced letters by fax on earlier dates If you need another copy please let me know Celina Original Message From Jim Linville mailto Sent Tuesday November PM To Cc James Randall Subject Response to Teleconference Celina and James During our teleconference today you asked for an example of what we would consider significant emission reductions that would be acceptable in a casebycase review when the to ghphr NOx level could not be achieved A large stroke engine that is currently emitting approximately ghphr of NOx would be considered to have significant emissions reductions if actual emissions are reduced by percent even though it does not meet the to ghphr NOx level We would agree that this would have been considered BACT years ago if there was test data to validate the old premodification and new postmodification emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved Also needed in the casebycase review would be a representation of what the cost of the controls would be with a discussion of why the to ghphr NOx level could not be achieved This may be due to technical limitations such as no additional controls or modifications are possible or you may identify cost in dollars per ton of NOx controlled to show that even though additional modifications are available the cost is prohibitive Original Message From Celina Romero SMTP Sent Friday November AM To Cc Subject letter from TNRCC re yr BACT I received by fax late yesterday evening a letter signed by John Steib re yr BACT guidelines for engines and turbines for use in the VERP program After my first read it looks pretty good Look for a copy of it by fax Let me know if you have any comments or concerns that we need to clear up with the TNRCC Celina November Ms Celina Romero Attorney Clark Thomas Winters PO Box Austin Texas Re Permitting Grandfathered Internal Combustion Engines and Turbines Dear Ms Romero As discussed in our meetings and teleconferences concerning the options for grandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines we have agreed that some of these facilities may qualify under Standard Exemption Nos or effective on December and others may be permitted under Texas Administrative Code TAC Chapter Subchapter H Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits VERP Specific questions raised are discussed below You have asked for our understanding of what qualifies as an engine train of less than hp In your November letter you gave two examples of engine trains that you felt would meet Standard Exemption No Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than hp and engine trains of less than hp total We agree that several engines each less than hp can be combined into a train providing compression to a common header so long as the train does not exceed hp meet the exemption requirements In cases where the total horsepower in a train exceeds hp we will allow exemption of individual engines within such a train provided that each engine is less than hp and the total horsepower of exempted engines in the train does not exceed hp In the same standard exemption list turbines were covered by Standard Exemption No Gas turbines of less than hp burning sweet natural gas The other major point of discussion has been the determination of year old BACT required by TAC oA As we discussed our review of permitting years ago reveals that very few if any old engines were permitted so no data is available to show what we would have required for nitrogen oxides NOX best available control technology BACT New engines were permitted at gramshorsepowerhour ghphr of NOX for both rich burn and lean burn engines At that time older rich burn engines could have been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this ghphr limit for NOX Lean burn engines were and are still more problematic as both stroke and stroke versions are available and no single method of control is applicable The large number of different engine manufacturers and the availability of various models makes it impossible to establish a single year old BACT level Some of the older engines may be capable of being upgraded to meet a level of NOX of to ghphr the level established in the revision of Standard Exemption No which also established a ghphr standard for turbines While the standard exemption does not establish BACT for upgrades it does recognize what is available Many of the grandfathered engines are large and some have emissions as high as to ghphr so significant emission reductions may be achievable even if they are not able to reduce to the emissions control level of to ghphr The year old BACT review on these engines and turbines will have to be done on a casebycase basis just as we would have done years ago We hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they will be able to either exempt or permit under the VERP program and submit their letters of intent to participate in the VERP program by December For engines and turbines that your members decide to propose for authorization under Standard Exemption Nos and please identify the specific engines and turbines identified by unit number emission point number EPN air quality account number and plant name and for each account please submit a Form PI For each engine or turbine please submit a Table or as applicable and other technical information that will support the standard exemption claim For engines that will be authorized by a VERP permit please identify each engine by unit number EPN air quality account number and plant name and provide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a result of participation in the VERP program When the VERP applications are submitted information should be provided to show that NOX emissions will be in the to ghphr range If it is not possible to achieve this level of emissions please submit information that shows that it is not technically feasible or economically reasonable to control NOX emissions to that level Information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved even when the targeted range of to ghphr cannot be met will be helpful in staff review of the application We appreciate your assistance in helping us to make the VERP program a success If you have any further questions please contact Mr James Randall PE at Sincerely John F Steib

personnel made a presentation on the implementation of the grandfather legislation and Charlie Child attended a meeting on August where TNRCC also made a presentation on the grandfather legislation The following existing authorization options are available for grandfathered sources old Standard Exemptions Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits VERP regular permits or Permits By Rule The grandfather legislation which is still in the rulemaking process is for permitting grandfathered sources that have not been authorized by the existing options These programs are discussed below Old Standard Exemptions As you know ETS has implemented a program to authorize grandfathered emission sources under old Standard Exemptions now Permits by Rule wherever possible so they would not be subject to the grandfather regulations TNRCC indicated at the meeting that you would have until the deadlines for submitting applications in east Texas and in West Texas to authorize the sources under old St Ex Keep in mind that this program is not part of the TNRCC regulationsit is being implemented under a verbal agreement with the TNRCC and could change at any moment TNRCC recommended that PI forms be submitted for all locations that are included on their list of emission sources Note the list is based on TNRCCs listing of emissions inventories and Ruth has distributed this list to the appropriate DESs For locations not on this list internal records would be sufficient and nothing needs to be submitted to TNRCC unless required under the conditions of the StEx One thing to keep in mind is that TNRCC is revising the rules governing Permits by RuleSt Ex with increased recordkeeping requirements so that any emission sources authorized by StEx will be subject to the new recordkeeping rules scheduled to be finalized on It is recommended that the Standard Exemption submittals be received by the TNRCC as soon as possible In addition to engines old Standard Exemptions or existing Permits By Rule should be used for the remaining grandfathered sources tanks heaters etc Grandfather Legislation The grandfather legislation includes a specific permit for reciprocating engines Other grandfather sources must obtain an Existing Facility Permit under the legislation Unlike the Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits VERP program there is no amnesty granted for modifications uncovered during the permitting process Discovery of a modification may result in enforcement action In addition the source is no longer eligible for a grandfather permit and must obtain a regular permit or Permit By Rule and be subject to BACT gbhphr In order to take advantage of the VERP program amnesty provision TNRCC is urging industry to submit VERP applications by the August deadline Under the grandfather legislation grandfathered reciprocating engines in East Texas are subject to reductions of NOx and may be subject to reductions of VOC Recips in West Texas are subject to up to reductions of NOx and VOC The reductions will be determined on a caseby case basis by the permit engineer reviewing the application Although previously there was hope that no reductions would be required in West Texas at the August meeting TNRCC indicated that they would require at least reductions in West Texas TNRCC has not decided how to deal with VOC reductions but one TNRCC staff member did mention he was aware that oxidation catalysts could reduce VOC emissions on engines In the August meeting TNRCC indicated that the reductions for recips will be calculated from a baseline of the average actual emissions in This was not the intent of the legislation and the legislators will be contacted by our industry organizations to attempt to change this My thinking is that the reductions will likely be based on a before hourly gramshphr rate from stack testing or maybe AP and an after hourly emissions rate based on stack testing The reductions required from recips can be averaged across a pipeline but reductions mandated by a regulation cannot be included Reductions from a shutdown of an emission source can be included in the average and it was suggested that reductions since could be included but this has not been determined It is highly unlikely that that TNRCC will allow reductions in East Texas to be averaged with reductions in West Texas Grandfathered emission sources other than recips are subject to year old BACT When discussing whether there would be any relief for smaller emission sources such as grandfathered valves or flanges the TNRCC attorney indicated that there is no lower threshold and that all emissions sources must be authorized either by the existing authorizations or grandfather permits by the deadlines in this legislation See the notes above about the locations that TNRCC expects paperwork to be submitted for St Ex The controlreduction deadlines for reducing emissions from all grandfathered emission sources is in East Texas and in West Texas However TNRCC indicated that controls will likely be required prior to these dates When you receive your permit for grandfathered sources they anticipate that you will have months to install controls Since the applications are due on and and TNRCC has one year to process applications but it could be less you should anticipate being required to install controls in The application fee may be The grandfather rule will be proposed on October and should be finalized in March If you have any questions contact me or Ruth Jensen Marc N Phillips Director Regulatory

James Subject Grandfathered Facilities Endangered Species With No Prospects o f Protection The days of grandfathered facilities in Texas are numbered This does not only mean those large facilities in nonattainment areas but ANY facility that was constructed prior to September and has not subsequently been rolled into some sort of new source review NSR permit or Permit by Rule formerly Standard Exemption Note that proposed new rules recently published in the Texas Register for public comment will require operators to be able to produce documentation of applicability and compliance for all facilities authorized by a Permit by RuleStandard Exemption much the same as is required for any other type of permit The TNRCC Sunset Bill contains language limiting the time that such facilities may operate without NSR authorization of some sort The Senate Committee Substitute SCS for HB is a little stricter than the version passed by the House but both versions did contain grandfathered facility permitting provisions and it is safe to assume that the final version will also If this version passes you will have one additional year to apply for a Voluntary Emissions Reduction Permit VERP If your facility is a pipeline facility the TNRCC will require no more than a reduction in NOx and that reduction can be averaged for several facilities in the same area covered in one permit Note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists particularly Cindy Morphew of TxOGA and Celina Romero of ATINGP that it looks as though we will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permitted without having to use todays BACT This memo summarizes the SCS provisions for your information This is NOT actual bill language Ive TRIED to make it easier to read Note that these provisions may be changed somewhat if the House does not concur in all of the changes made by the Senate and the bill goes to Conference In addition we expect a strong attempt to amend the bill on the Senate floor to require shutdown on September of grandfathered facilities that do not have a pending permit application If that attempt is successful the opportunity to apply for a VERP will be gone on September The memo also recaps previous recommendations to you regarding the current opportunity to claim historical Permits by Rule Standard Exemptions as a means of permitting a grandfathered facility I am not certain how long this opportunity will continue to exist TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE YOU CAN In addition Ive appended some information on year old BACT for gasfired IC engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying to get a VERP now PROVISIONS OF SCS FOR HB PRIOR TO SENATE FLOOR DEBATE Sec PERMIT REQUIRED a Any grandfathered facility that does not have an application pending for a new source review permit or other authorization other than a federal operating permit and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown as provided in Section may not emit air contaminants on or after September if the facility is located in a nonattainment area or September if the facility is located in an attainment area b Any grandfathered facility that does not have a permit or other authorization under this chapter other than a federal operating permit permit may not emit air contaminants on or after September if the facility is located in a nonattainment area or September if the facility is located in an attainment area c Facilities eligible for a Small Business Stationary Source Permit are subject to the permitting deadlines in Section Sec NOTICE OF SHUTDOWN a A notice of shutdown to allow operation of a grandfathered facility beyond the deadlines of a must be filed with the commission before the applicable deadline b A notice under this section shall include the date the facility intends to cease operating an inventory of the type and amount of emissions that will be eliminated when the facility ceases to operate and any other necessary and relevant information the commission by rule deems appropriate GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO PERMITS UNDER AND a The commission shall grant a permit under this section if from the information available to the commission including information presented at any public hearing or through written comment the commission finds that there is no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravene the intent of this chapter including protection of the publics health and physical property b If the commission finds that the emissions from the facility will not comply with Subsection c the commission may not grant the permit under this section c A person planning the modification of a facility previously permitted under this section must comply with new source permitting requirements before modifying d The commission may adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer this section e If an applicant omits any relevant facts or submits incorrect information in an application the applicant shall submit the relevant facts or correct the information no later than days after discovering the error If while processing the application the commission determines that additional information is necessary to evaluate or to take final action on the application the commission may request the information and set a reasonable deadline for a response Failure to comply with the deadline for the response will result in the application being returned to the applicant Sec EXISTING FACILITY PERMIT a The owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may apply for a permit to operate the facility under this section b The commission shall grant a permit under this section if from the information available to the commission including information presented at any public hearing or through written comment the commission finds that the application is filed before September and the facility will use an air pollution control method at least as effective as year old BACT or is filed before the applicable deadline of a and the facility will use current BACT c The commission may issue an existing facility flexible permit for some or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site Permits issued under this subsection shall follow the same permit issuance modification and renewal procedures as existing facility permits Sec SMALL BUSINESS STATIONARY SOURCE PERMIT a Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business stationary source and are not required by commission rule to submit an annual emissions inventory report may apply for a permit under this section before September b Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business stationary source that does not have an application pending for a new source review permit or other authorization other than a federal operating permit and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown may not emit air contaminants on or after September Sec ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITY PERMIT Special provisions for permitting grandfathered electric generating facilities are not outlined in this memo Sec AUTHORIZATION FOR PIPELINE FACILITIES a The commission by rule shall establish the procedures for applications for grandfathered processing treating compression or pumping facilities connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline b Based on a prioritization by the commission as necessary to meet local regional and statewide air quality needs related directly or indirectly to federal air quality standards the commission may require up to a reduction of the hourly emission rates of NOx and VOC from reciprocating internal combustion engines subject to this section For facilities other than reciprocating internal combustion engines that are connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline the commission may consider requiring hourly emissions rate reductions of up to for NOx and for VOC The commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than in other areas but no more than percent reductions in the hourly rate may be required in any area c The commission shall allow for a single permit for all facilities connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline allow for required reductions for facilities under this section to be achieved at one facility or averaged among more than one facility and located in the same local regional or statewide areas designated by the commission under Subsection b for purposes of emission averaging allow emission reductions achieved from grandfathered since September and allow an owner or operator to apply for separate permits under this section for discrete and separate facilities connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline d Facilities authorized by this section shall be considered permitted under this chapter CURRENT OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM A PERMIT BY RULE TO PERMIT A GRANDFATHERED FACILITY TNRCC has interpreted its rules to allow operators to permit grandfathered facilities using any applicable Permit by Rule including those previously referred to as Standard Exemptions For instance old Standard Exemption effective May was for Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than hp and engine trains of less than hp total and can be used to permit any such engines For clarification on this particular exemption the language used by staff in proposing this exemption to the Texas Air Control Board in was as follows Engines smaller than hp are quite numerous and are not considered a substantial source unless joined together IN SERIES emphasis added to form an engine train Engine trains of less than hp are not considered a substantial source Because control technology for NOx emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited it is doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permit system at this time Exemptions From Permits Procedures and Justification for Exemptions signed Charles R Barden PE Executive Secretary Texas Air Control Board May A list of the Historical Standard Exemptions is available on the TNRCC Website at airnsrpermitsoldselistindexhtml airnsrpermitsoldselistindexhtml In applying these Permits by Rule be sure to check the corresponding Exemption Preambles if any for any applicable General Conditions TNRCC has asked that we document such permitting of grandfathered facilities by PI AND a simple notification cover letter to them so that they will have a record that the facilities have been permitted and are no longer considered to be grandfathered The registration will buy you a letter of acknowledgement that you have claimed the permit by rule dont use the term exemption in any correspondence for these engines CORRESPONDENCE WITH TNRCC ON YEAR OLD BACT FOR GAS ENGINES AND TURBINES From Celina Romero Sent Monday December PM To Cc Subject Response to Teleconference I believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the TRNCC will provide to us regarding the development of guidelines for year BACT for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the VERP program The last piece of information is an email that I am forwarding to you with this email It is an email from John Steib to which he attaches an email from Jim Linville In response to a request from us Jim Linville sets forth in his email an example of a large engine with emissions in the gram per horsepower hour range that cannot reduce emissions to the gram level and what the owneroperator of that engine must demonstrate in order to obtain a VERP permit Remember that in order to be included in the TNRCCs January report to the legislature a letter of intent or application for a VERP should be filed with the TNRCC on or before next Thursday December To summarize we have obtained the following policies from the TNRCC Grandfathered internal combustion engines of less than horsepower can be authorized by Standard Exemption No effective December regardless of the level of emissions from those facilities See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September and Drakes letter to me dated October Grandfathered engine trains of less than horsepower or a portion of an engine train up to horsepower may be authorized under Standard Exemption No December so long as each engine in the train does not exceed horsepower See my letter to James Randall dated November and Randalls letter to me dated November Grandfathered turbines of less than horsepower may be authorized by Standard Exemption No dated December regardless of the level of emissions See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September and Drakes letter to me dated October Grandfathered engines and turbines that are able to be controlled to the gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review See James Randalls letter to me dated November Grandfathered engines and turbines that are not able to be controlled to the gram range may be permittable under a VERP if there is test data to validate the old premodification and new postmodification emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved Also needed would be a representation of the cost of the controls and even though additional modifications are available the additional cost is prohibitive See Jim Randalls letter to me dated November and the email attached hereto I hope all of this is helpful I have forwarded to you copies of the referenced letters by fax on earlier dates If you need another copy please let me know Celina Original Message From Jim Linville mailto Sent Tuesday November PM To Cc James Randall Subject Response to Teleconference Celina and James During our teleconference today you asked for an example of what we would consider significant emission reductions that would be acceptable in a casebycase review when the to ghphr NOx level could not be achieved A large stroke engine that is currently emitting approximately ghphr of NOx would be considered to have significant emissions reductions if actual emissions are reduced by percent even though it does not meet the to ghphr NOx level We would agree that this would have been considered BACT years ago if there was test data to validate the old premodification and new postmodification emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved Also needed in the casebycase review would be a representation of what the cost of the controls would be with a discussion of why the to ghphr NOx level could not be achieved This may be due to technical limitations such as no additional controls or modifications are possible or you may identify cost in dollars per ton of NOx controlled to show that even though additional modifications are available the cost is prohibitive Original Message From Celina Romero SMTP Sent Friday November AM To Cc Subject letter from TNRCC re yr BACT I received by fax late yesterday evening a letter signed by John Steib re yr BACT guidelines for engines and turbines for use in the VERP program After my first read it looks pretty good Look for a copy of it by fax Let me know if you have any comments or concerns that we need to clear up with the TNRCC Celina November Ms Celina Romero Attorney Clark Thomas Winters PO Box Austin Texas Re Permitting Grandfathered Internal Combustion Engines and Turbines Dear Ms Romero As discussed in our meetings and teleconferences concerning the options for grandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines we have agreed that some of these facilities may qualify under Standard Exemption Nos or effective on December and others may be permitted under Texas Administrative Code TAC Chapter Subchapter H Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits VERP Specific questions raised are discussed below You have asked for our understanding of what qualifies as an engine train of less than hp In your November letter you gave two examples of engine trains that you felt would meet Standard Exemption No Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than hp and engine trains of less than hp total We agree that several engines each less than hp can be combined into a train providing compression to a common header so long as the train does not exceed hp meet the exemption requirements In cases where the total horsepower in a train exceeds hp we will allow exemption of individual engines within such a train provided that each engine is less than hp and the total horsepower of exempted engines in the train does not exceed hp In the same standard exemption list turbines were covered by Standard Exemption No Gas turbines of less than hp burning sweet natural gas The other major point of discussion has been the determination of year old BACT required by TAC oA As we discussed our review of permitting years ago reveals that very few if any old engines were permitted so no data is available to show what we would have required for nitrogen oxides NOX best available control technology BACT New engines were permitted at gramshorsepowerhour ghphr of NOX for both rich burn and lean burn engines At that time older rich burn engines could have been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this ghphr limit for NOX Lean burn engines were and are still more problematic as both stroke and stroke versions are available and no single method of control is applicable The large number of different engine manufacturers and the availability of various models makes it impossible to establish a single year old BACT level Some of the older engines may be capable of being upgraded to meet a level of NOX of to ghphr the level established in the revision of Standard Exemption No which also established a ghphr standard for turbines While the standard exemption does not establish BACT for upgrades it does recognize what is available Many of the grandfathered engines are large and some have emissions as high as to ghphr so significant emission reductions may be achievable even if they are not able to reduce to the emissions control level of to ghphr The year old BACT review on these engines and turbines will have to be done on a casebycase basis just as we would have done years ago We hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they will be able to either exempt or permit under the VERP program and submit their letters of intent to participate in the VERP program by December For engines and turbines that your members decide to propose for authorization under Standard Exemption Nos and please identify the specific engines and turbines identified by unit number emission point number EPN air quality account number and plant name and for each account please submit a Form PI For each engine or turbine please submit a Table or as applicable and other technical information that will support the standard exemption claim For engines that will be authorized by a VERP permit please identify each engine by unit number EPN air quality account number and plant name and provide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a result of participation in the VERP program When the VERP applications are submitted information should be provided to show that NOX emissions will be in the to ghphr range If it is not possible to achieve this level of emissions please submit information that shows that it is not technically feasible or economically reasonable to control NOX emissions to that level Information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved even when the targeted range of to ghphr cannot be met will be helpful in staff review of the application We appreciate your assistance in helping us to make the VERP program a success If you have any further questions please contact Mr James Randall PE at Sincerely John F Steib

personnel made a presentation on the implementation of the grandfather legislation and Charlie Child attended a meeting on August where TNRCC also made a presentation on the grandfather legislation The following existing authorization options are available for grandfathered sources old Standard Exemptions Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits VERP regular permits or Permits By Rule The grandfather legislation which is still in the rulemaking process is for permitting grandfathered sources that have not been authorized by the existing options These programs are discussed below Old Standard Exemptions As you know ETS has implemented a program to authorize grandfathered emission sources under old Standard Exemptions now Permits by Rule wherever possible so they would not be subject to the grandfather regulations TNRCC indicated at the meeting that you would have until the deadlines for submitting applications in east Texas and in West Texas to authorize the sources under old St Ex Keep in mind that this program is not part of the TNRCC regulationsit is being implemented under a verbal agreement with the TNRCC and could change at any moment TNRCC recommended that PI forms be submitted for all locations that are included on their list of emission sources Note the list is based on TNRCCs listing of emissions inventories and Ruth has distributed this list to the appropriate DESs For locations not on this list internal records would be sufficient and nothing needs to be submitted to TNRCC unless required under the conditions of the StEx One thing to keep in mind is that TNRCC is revising the rules governing Permits by RuleSt Ex with increased recordkeeping requirements so that any emission sources authorized by StEx will be subject to the new recordkeeping rules scheduled to be finalized on It is recommended that the Standard Exemption submittals be received by the TNRCC as soon as possible In addition to engines old Standard Exemptions or existing Permits By Rule should be used for the remaining grandfathered sources tanks heaters etc Grandfather Legislation The grandfather legislation includes a specific permit for reciprocating engines Other grandfather sources must obtain an Existing Facility Permit under the legislation Unlike the Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits VERP program there is no amnesty granted for modifications uncovered during the permitting process Discovery of a modification may result in enforcement action In addition the source is no longer eligible for a grandfather permit and must obtain a regular permit or Permit By Rule and be subject to BACT gbhphr In order to take advantage of the VERP program amnesty provision TNRCC is urging industry to submit VERP applications by the August deadline Under the grandfather legislation grandfathered reciprocating engines in East Texas are subject to reductions of NOx and may be subject to reductions of VOC Recips in West Texas are subject to up to reductions of NOx and VOC The reductions will be determined on a caseby case basis by the permit engineer reviewing the application Although previously there was hope that no reductions would be required in West Texas at the August meeting TNRCC indicated that they would require at least reductions in West Texas TNRCC has not decided how to deal with VOC reductions but one TNRCC staff member did mention he was aware that oxidation catalysts could reduce VOC emissions on engines In the August meeting TNRCC indicated that the reductions for recips will be calculated from a baseline of the average actual emissions in This was not the intent of the legislation and the legislators will be contacted by our industry organizations to attempt to change this My thinking is that the reductions will likely be based on a before hourly gramshphr rate from stack testing or maybe AP and an after hourly emissions rate based on stack testing The reductions required from recips can be averaged across a pipeline but reductions mandated by a regulation cannot be included Reductions from a shutdown of an emission source can be included in the average and it was suggested that reductions since could be included but this has not been determined It is highly unlikely that that TNRCC will allow reductions in East Texas to be averaged with reductions in West Texas Grandfathered emission sources other than recips are subject to year old BACT When discussing whether there would be any relief for smaller emission sources such as grandfathered valves or flanges the TNRCC attorney indicated that there is no lower threshold and that all emissions sources must be authorized either by the existing authorizations or grandfather permits by the deadlines in this legislation See the notes above about the locations that TNRCC expects paperwork to be submitted for St Ex The controlreduction deadlines for reducing emissions from all grandfathered emission sources is in East Texas and in West Texas However TNRCC indicated that controls will likely be required prior to these dates When you receive your permit for grandfathered sources they anticipate that you will have months to install controls Since the applications are due on and and TNRCC has one year to process applications but it could be less you should anticipate being required to install controls in The application fee may be The grandfather rule will be proposed on October and should be finalized in March If you have any questions contact me or Ruth Jensen Marc N Phillips Director Regulatory

James Subject Grandfathered Facilities Endangered Species With No Prospects o f Protection The days of grandfathered facilities in Texas are numbered This does not only mean those large facilities in nonattainment areas but ANY facility that was constructed prior to September and has not subsequently been rolled into some sort of new source review NSR permit or Permit by Rule formerly Standard Exemption Note that proposed new rules recently published in the Texas Register for public comment will require operators to be able to produce documentation of applicability and compliance for all facilities authorized by a Permit by RuleStandard Exemption much the same as is required for any other type of permit The TNRCC Sunset Bill contains language limiting the time that such facilities may operate without NSR authorization of some sort The Senate Committee Substitute SCS for HB is a little stricter than the version passed by the House but both versions did contain grandfathered facility permitting provisions and it is safe to assume that the final version will also If this version passes you will have one additional year to apply for a Voluntary Emissions Reduction Permit VERP If your facility is a pipeline facility the TNRCC will require no more than a reduction in NOx and that reduction can be averaged for several facilities in the same area covered in one permit Note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists particularly Cindy Morphew of TxOGA and Celina Romero of ATINGP that it looks as though we will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permitted without having to use todays BACT This memo summarizes the SCS provisions for your information This is NOT actual bill language Ive TRIED to make it easier to read Note that these provisions may be changed somewhat if the House does not concur in all of the changes made by the Senate and the bill goes to Conference In addition we expect a strong attempt to amend the bill on the Senate floor to require shutdown on September of grandfathered facilities that do not have a pending permit application If that attempt is successful the opportunity to apply for a VERP will be gone on September The memo also recaps previous recommendations to you regarding the current opportunity to claim historical Permits by Rule Standard Exemptions as a means of permitting a grandfathered facility I am not certain how long this opportunity will continue to exist TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE YOU CAN In addition Ive appended some information on year old BACT for gasfired IC engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying to get a VERP now PROVISIONS OF SCS FOR HB PRIOR TO SENATE FLOOR DEBATE Sec PERMIT REQUIRED a Any grandfathered facility that does not have an application pending for a new source review permit or other authorization other than a federal operating permit and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown as provided in Section may not emit air contaminants on or after September if the facility is located in a nonattainment area or September if the facility is located in an attainment area b Any grandfathered facility that does not have a permit or other authorization under this chapter other than a federal operating permit permit may not emit air contaminants on or after September if the facility is located in a nonattainment area or September if the facility is located in an attainment area c Facilities eligible for a Small Business Stationary Source Permit are subject to the permitting deadlines in Section Sec NOTICE OF SHUTDOWN a A notice of shutdown to allow operation of a grandfathered facility beyond the deadlines of a must be filed with the commission before the applicable deadline b A notice under this section shall include the date the facility intends to cease operating an inventory of the type and amount of emissions that will be eliminated when the facility ceases to operate and any other necessary and relevant information the commission by rule deems appropriate GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO PERMITS UNDER AND a The commission shall grant a permit under this section if from the information available to the commission including information presented at any public hearing or through written comment the commission finds that there is no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravene the intent of this chapter including protection of the publics health and physical property b If the commission finds that the emissions from the facility will not comply with Subsection c the commission may not grant the permit under this section c A person planning the modification of a facility previously permitted under this section must comply with new source permitting requirements before modifying d The commission may adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer this section e If an applicant omits any relevant facts or submits incorrect information in an application the applicant shall submit the relevant facts or correct the information no later than days after discovering the error If while processing the application the commission determines that additional information is necessary to evaluate or to take final action on the application the commission may request the information and set a reasonable deadline for a response Failure to comply with the deadline for the response will result in the application being returned to the applicant Sec EXISTING FACILITY PERMIT a The owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may apply for a permit to operate the facility under this section b The commission shall grant a permit under this section if from the information available to the commission including information presented at any public hearing or through written comment the commission finds that the application is filed before September and the facility will use an air pollution control method at least as effective as year old BACT or is filed before the applicable deadline of a and the facility will use current BACT c The commission may issue an existing facility flexible permit for some or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site Permits issued under this subsection shall follow the same permit issuance modification and renewal procedures as existing facility permits Sec SMALL BUSINESS STATIONARY SOURCE PERMIT a Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business stationary source and are not required by commission rule to submit an annual emissions inventory report may apply for a permit under this section before September b Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business stationary source that does not have an application pending for a new source review permit or other authorization other than a federal operating permit and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown may not emit air contaminants on or after September Sec ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITY PERMIT Special provisions for permitting grandfathered electric generating facilities are not outlined in this memo Sec AUTHORIZATION FOR PIPELINE FACILITIES a The commission by rule shall establish the procedures for applications for grandfathered processing treating compression or pumping facilities connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline b Based on a prioritization by the commission as necessary to meet local regional and statewide air quality needs related directly or indirectly to federal air quality standards the commission may require up to a reduction of the hourly emission rates of NOx and VOC from reciprocating internal combustion engines subject to this section For facilities other than reciprocating internal combustion engines that are connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline the commission may consider requiring hourly emissions rate reductions of up to for NOx and for VOC The commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than in other areas but no more than percent reductions in the hourly rate may be required in any area c The commission shall allow for a single permit for all facilities connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline allow for required reductions for facilities under this section to be achieved at one facility or averaged among more than one facility and located in the same local regional or statewide areas designated by the commission under Subsection b for purposes of emission averaging allow emission reductions achieved from grandfathered since September and allow an owner or operator to apply for separate permits under this section for discrete and separate facilities connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline d Facilities authorized by this section shall be considered permitted under this chapter CURRENT OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM A PERMIT BY RULE TO PERMIT A GRANDFATHERED FACILITY TNRCC has interpreted its rules to allow operators to permit grandfathered facilities using any applicable Permit by Rule including those previously referred to as Standard Exemptions For instance old Standard Exemption effective May was for Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than hp and engine trains of less than hp total and can be used to permit any such engines For clarification on this particular exemption the language used by staff in proposing this exemption to the Texas Air Control Board in was as follows Engines smaller than hp are quite numerous and are not considered a substantial source unless joined together IN SERIES emphasis added to form an engine train Engine trains of less than hp are not considered a substantial source Because control technology for NOx emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited it is doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permit system at this time Exemptions From Permits Procedures and Justification for Exemptions signed Charles R Barden PE Executive Secretary Texas Air Control Board May A list of the Historical Standard Exemptions is available on the TNRCC Website at airnsrpermitsoldselistindexhtml airnsrpermitsoldselistindexhtml In applying these Permits by Rule be sure to check the corresponding Exemption Preambles if any for any applicable General Conditions TNRCC has asked that we document such permitting of grandfathered facilities by PI AND a simple notification cover letter to them so that they will have a record that the facilities have been permitted and are no longer considered to be grandfathered The registration will buy you a letter of acknowledgement that you have claimed the permit by rule dont use the term exemption in any correspondence for these engines CORRESPONDENCE WITH TNRCC ON YEAR OLD BACT FOR GAS ENGINES AND TURBINES From Celina Romero Sent Monday December PM To Cc Subject Response to Teleconference I believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the TRNCC will provide to us regarding the development of guidelines for year BACT for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the VERP program The last piece of information is an email that I am forwarding to you with this email It is an email from John Steib to which he attaches an email from Jim Linville In response to a request from us Jim Linville sets forth in his email an example of a large engine with emissions in the gram per horsepower hour range that cannot reduce emissions to the gram level and what the owneroperator of that engine must demonstrate in order to obtain a VERP permit Remember that in order to be included in the TNRCCs January report to the legislature a letter of intent or application for a VERP should be filed with the TNRCC on or before next Thursday December To summarize we have obtained the following policies from the TNRCC Grandfathered internal combustion engines of less than horsepower can be authorized by Standard Exemption No effective December regardless of the level of emissions from those facilities See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September and Drakes letter to me dated October Grandfathered engine trains of less than horsepower or a portion of an engine train up to horsepower may be authorized under Standard Exemption No December so long as each engine in the train does not exceed horsepower See my letter to James Randall dated November and Randalls letter to me dated November Grandfathered turbines of less than horsepower may be authorized by Standard Exemption No dated December regardless of the level of emissions See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September and Drakes letter to me dated October Grandfathered engines and turbines that are able to be controlled to the gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review See James Randalls letter to me dated November Grandfathered engines and turbines that are not able to be controlled to the gram range may be permittable under a VERP if there is test data to validate the old premodification and new postmodification emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved Also needed would be a representation of the cost of the controls and even though additional modifications are available the additional cost is prohibitive See Jim Randalls letter to me dated November and the email attached hereto I hope all of this is helpful I have forwarded to you copies of the referenced letters by fax on earlier dates If you need another copy please let me know Celina Original Message From Jim Linville mailto Sent Tuesday November PM To Cc James Randall Subject Response to Teleconference Celina and James During our teleconference today you asked for an example of what we would consider significant emission reductions that would be acceptable in a casebycase review when the to ghphr NOx level could not be achieved A large stroke engine that is currently emitting approximately ghphr of NOx would be considered to have significant emissions reductions if actual emissions are reduced by percent even though it does not meet the to ghphr NOx level We would agree that this would have been considered BACT years ago if there was test data to validate the old premodification and new postmodification emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved Also needed in the casebycase review would be a representation of what the cost of the controls would be with a discussion of why the to ghphr NOx level could not be achieved This may be due to technical limitations such as no additional controls or modifications are possible or you may identify cost in dollars per ton of NOx controlled to show that even though additional modifications are available the cost is prohibitive Original Message From Celina Romero SMTP Sent Friday November AM To Cc Subject letter from TNRCC re yr BACT I received by fax late yesterday evening a letter signed by John Steib re yr BACT guidelines for engines and turbines for use in the VERP program After my first read it looks pretty good Look for a copy of it by fax Let me know if you have any comments or concerns that we need to clear up with the TNRCC Celina November Ms Celina Romero Attorney Clark Thomas Winters PO Box Austin Texas Re Permitting Grandfathered Internal Combustion Engines and Turbines Dear Ms Romero As discussed in our meetings and teleconferences concerning the options for grandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines we have agreed that some of these facilities may qualify under Standard Exemption Nos or effective on December and others may be permitted under Texas Administrative Code TAC Chapter Subchapter H Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits VERP Specific questions raised are discussed below You have asked for our understanding of what qualifies as an engine train of less than hp In your November letter you gave two examples of engine trains that you felt would meet Standard Exemption No Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than hp and engine trains of less than hp total We agree that several engines each less than hp can be combined into a train providing compression to a common header so long as the train does not exceed hp meet the exemption requirements In cases where the total horsepower in a train exceeds hp we will allow exemption of individual engines within such a train provided that each engine is less than hp and the total horsepower of exempted engines in the train does not exceed hp In the same standard exemption list turbines were covered by Standard Exemption No Gas turbines of less than hp burning sweet natural gas The other major point of discussion has been the determination of year old BACT required by TAC oA As we discussed our review of permitting years ago reveals that very few if any old engines were permitted so no data is available to show what we would have required for nitrogen oxides NOX best available control technology BACT New engines were permitted at gramshorsepowerhour ghphr of NOX for both rich burn and lean burn engines At that time older rich burn engines could have been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this ghphr limit for NOX Lean burn engines were and are still more problematic as both stroke and stroke versions are available and no single method of control is applicable The large number of different engine manufacturers and the availability of various models makes it impossible to establish a single year old BACT level Some of the older engines may be capable of being upgraded to meet a level of NOX of to ghphr the level established in the revision of Standard Exemption No which also established a ghphr standard for turbines While the standard exemption does not establish BACT for upgrades it does recognize what is available Many of the grandfathered engines are large and some have emissions as high as to ghphr so significant emission reductions may be achievable even if they are not able to reduce to the emissions control level of to ghphr The year old BACT review on these engines and turbines will have to be done on a casebycase basis just as we would have done years ago We hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they will be able to either exempt or permit under the VERP program and submit their letters of intent to participate in the VERP program by December For engines and turbines that your members decide to propose for authorization under Standard Exemption Nos and please identify the specific engines and turbines identified by unit number emission point number EPN air quality account number and plant name and for each account please submit a Form PI For each engine or turbine please submit a Table or as applicable and other technical information that will support the standard exemption claim For engines that will be authorized by a VERP permit please identify each engine by unit number EPN air quality account number and plant name and provide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a result of participation in the VERP program When the VERP applications are submitted information should be provided to show that NOX emissions will be in the to ghphr range If it is not possible to achieve this level of emissions please submit information that shows that it is not technically feasible or economically reasonable to control NOX emissions to that level Information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved even when the targeted range of to ghphr cannot be met will be helpful in staff review of the application We appreciate your assistance in helping us to make the VERP program a success If you have any further questions please contact Mr James Randall PE at Sincerely John F Steib

personnel made a presentation on the implementation of the grandfather legislation and Charlie Child attended a meeting on August where TNRCC also made a presentation on the grandfather legislation The following existing authorization options are available for grandfathered sources old Standard Exemptions Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits VERP regular permits or Permits By Rule The grandfather legislation which is still in the rulemaking process is for permitting grandfathered sources that have not been authorized by the existing options These programs are discussed below Old Standard Exemptions As you know ETS has implemented a program to authorize grandfathered emission sources under old Standard Exemptions now Permits by Rule wherever possible so they would not be subject to the grandfather regulations TNRCC indicated at the meeting that you would have until the deadlines for submitting applications in east Texas and in West Texas to authorize the sources under old St Ex Keep in mind that this program is not part of the TNRCC regulationsit is being implemented under a verbal agreement with the TNRCC and could change at any moment TNRCC recommended that PI forms be submitted for all locations that are included on their list of emission sources Note the list is based on TNRCCs listing of emissions inventories and Ruth has distributed this list to the appropriate DESs For locations not on this list internal records would be sufficient and nothing needs to be submitted to TNRCC unless required under the conditions of the StEx One thing to keep in mind is that TNRCC is revising the rules governing Permits by RuleSt Ex with increased recordkeeping requirements so that any emission sources authorized by StEx will be subject to the new recordkeeping rules scheduled to be finalized on It is recommended that the Standard Exemption submittals be received by the TNRCC as soon as possible In addition to engines old Standard Exemptions or existing Permits By Rule should be used for the remaining grandfathered sources tanks heaters etc Grandfather Legislation The grandfather legislation includes a specific permit for reciprocating engines Other grandfather sources must obtain an Existing Facility Permit under the legislation Unlike the Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits VERP program there is no amnesty granted for modifications uncovered during the permitting process Discovery of a modification may result in enforcement action In addition the source is no longer eligible for a grandfather permit and must obtain a regular permit or Permit By Rule and be subject to BACT gbhphr In order to take advantage of the VERP program amnesty provision TNRCC is urging industry to submit VERP applications by the August deadline Under the grandfather legislation grandfathered reciprocating engines in East Texas are subject to reductions of NOx and may be subject to reductions of VOC Recips in West Texas are subject to up to reductions of NOx and VOC The reductions will be determined on a caseby case basis by the permit engineer reviewing the application Although previously there was hope that no reductions would be required in West Texas at the August meeting TNRCC indicated that they would require at least reductions in West Texas TNRCC has not decided how to deal with VOC reductions but one TNRCC staff member did mention he was aware that oxidation catalysts could reduce VOC emissions on engines In the August meeting TNRCC indicated that the reductions for recips will be calculated from a baseline of the average actual emissions in This was not the intent of the legislation and the legislators will be contacted by our industry organizations to attempt to change this My thinking is that the reductions will likely be based on a before hourly gramshphr rate from stack testing or maybe AP and an after hourly emissions rate based on stack testing The reductions required from recips can be averaged across a pipeline but reductions mandated by a regulation cannot be included Reductions from a shutdown of an emission source can be included in the average and it was suggested that reductions since could be included but this has not been determined It is highly unlikely that that TNRCC will allow reductions in East Texas to be averaged with reductions in West Texas Grandfathered emission sources other than recips are subject to year old BACT When discussing whether there would be any relief for smaller emission sources such as grandfathered valves or flanges the TNRCC attorney indicated that there is no lower threshold and that all emissions sources must be authorized either by the existing authorizations or grandfather permits by the deadlines in this legislation See the notes above about the locations that TNRCC expects paperwork to be submitted for St Ex The controlreduction deadlines for reducing emissions from all grandfathered emission sources is in East Texas and in West Texas However TNRCC indicated that controls will likely be required prior to these dates When you receive your permit for grandfathered sources they anticipate that you will have months to install controls Since the applications are due on and and TNRCC has one year to process applications but it could be less you should anticipate being required to install controls in The application fee may be The grandfather rule will be proposed on October and should be finalized in March If you have any questions contact me or Ruth Jensen Marc N Phillips Director Regulatory
