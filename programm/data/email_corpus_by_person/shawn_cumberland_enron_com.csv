Moyes said The firstquarter trucking mantra historically has been this everybody loses money in January hopes for a breakeven February and earns whatever profit there is in the quarter in March That formula may not hold this year Gregory L Quesnel president and CEO of ConWay Transportation Services and Emery Worldwide parent CNF Inc said the current slowdown was first detected late in the third quarter last year and has become more pronounced in each successive quarter March he said has been as disappointing as the first two months this year Layoffs already are occurring at the major LTL carriers Yellow Freight System has idled as many as Teamsters and hundreds of whitecollar backoffice workers Most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls that will cause them to miss analysts firstquarter estimates But there are deeper fears too Marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy Small familyowned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years ago Swifts volume dropoff began with shipments originating on the West Coast in January and February and it is continuing in March Moyes said Coupled with reduced demand from the Southwest Moyes said Swift will not meet analysts firstquarter earnings expectations Swift is not alone We hauled less freight in February than February a year ago said Bob Hammel executive vice president of Pittsburghbased Pitt Ohio Express a leading privately held Eastern regional LTL carrier The slowdown in manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous Nobody anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off Even ConWay the most profitable LTL operation in the past five years said it would have a decline in firstquarter operating income compared with the yearago period ConWays tonnage declines were estimated in the midsingledigit percentage range Roadway Express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running to percent below those a year ago which will result in an approximately onehalf of percent percent decline in its operating ratio see sidebar Pat Hanley Overnite Transportations senior vice president and chief financial officer said freight figures were flat in February year over year but rose slightly in March Overnite is the exception to the LTL industry with as many as new terminals scheduled to be opened this year January was pretty good to us but February was flat Its coming back in March Were probably up in low single digits to percent Were picking back up The economy has hurt us If you had asked us at the start of the year wed have said wed be up doubledigits Hanley said The national economic picture is a big concern Hanley said Were not seeing pressure on prices at least not so far Were seeing customers ship pallets a day instead of The shipment size is coming down Certainly were concerned Well do OK but not as great as wed like Forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever stars align in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspans world The genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking which is always a firstin firstout industry in any economic slowdown To hear trucking industry leaders tell it get comfortable with beans and franks for dinner Its going to be awhile before its filet mignon time again Shippers see whats happening as well but say its still too early in the year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks All the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business levels definitely slower than early last year said Bill Huie assistant vice president of corporate transportation for NCH Corp Irving Texas With a couple of exceptions carriers we talk with have no plans for expansion in the next few months We are getting feelers about some possible lane adjustments to boost revenue But generally it appears a little early in the economic downturn for much price movement The national LTL carriers are seeing the same things Our business is down pretty substantially for the first quarter said Roger Dick spokesman for Yellow Corp parent of Yellow Freight System and two large regional LTL carriers Jevic Transportation Delanco NJ and Saia Motor Freight Duluth Ga USFreightways Corp citing what it called the nations serious economic slowdown said it expects firstquarter earnings to fall very substantially below current Wall Street consensus Extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating environment USF Chairman President and CEO Samuel K Skinner added Traditionally the first quarter builds momentum slowly with March being the strongest month of the period Skinner said in a statement This year the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of accelerated in January and February softening even the normal modest expectations for those two months Its not just the LTL industry thats hurting The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter truckload freight index continues to show the worst demandsupply relationship since analyst James J Valentine began tracking the data in April Two events can cause weakness in the index according to Valentine They are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak freight demand So far in we have seen the confluence of both factors but the falloff in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply Valentine wrote in his most recent Trucking Snapshot for early March Yeartodate measurement for truckload demand is down percent year over year according to Valentines index while supply is up only percent That would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was masked by the strong economy Valentine says In a more ominous note Valentine believes overcapacity will continue to plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years Only a reaccelerating national economy can bring the demandsupply back in balance for the truckload sector in the near term Valentine predicts The overproduction of new Class trucks from early through early last year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at manufacturers wholesalers and other retailers Used trucks have lost on average more than percent of their value over the past months Anecdotally one used truck dealer Music City Truck Equipment in LaVergne Tenn is holding a twoforone sale on three to fiveyearold Class Freightliners You can buy two for around less than a brand new Chevy Suburban SUV What that means is a trucker who bought a Class truck for and depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the books this year at But assuming it has lost percent of that value it may only be worth in actuality For a carrier with a truck fleet that equates to a loss of more than million on assets The glut may last for a while according to Valentines analysis Assuming a threeyear tradein cycle most of the Class tractors in the truckload sector are just now rolling over to the usedtruck market That means that overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year That will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business as did nearly carriers last year that either closed or declared bankruptcy We can see from indexes surveys and other information available to us that it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in March and freight demands will continue to be soft throughout the month Based on all of these factors we expect USFreightways profits for the first quarter to be very substantially less than published analysts forecasts Skinner said In addition severe weather conditions including an earthquake in Seattle rainstorms in California and blizzards in the Northeast have added cost and decreased efficiencies Skinner added Expectations at each of USFs operating companies have been affected some more than others The LTL logistics reverse logistics and freightforwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a similar period last year Skinner said Further job cuts at USF Worldwide its freight forwarder would be in the offing as cost controls at the unit would be accelerated in the wake of the softening economy Skinner said Late last year Skinner said the rebuilding process at USF Worldwide would be a twoyear process But the worsening economy has made that rebuilding job harder he said We are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is in fact further impeding progress in this area Skinner said During the fourth quarter of and continuing into the first quarter of the company has taken steps to increase cost efficiencies Among these actions are a substantial cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force These costcontrol efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions In the first quarter USF posted million net income a percent rise from the million earnings in the first quarter At the time that was USFs th straight
