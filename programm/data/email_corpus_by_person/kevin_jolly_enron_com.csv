for Review New Cost Elements Per Stacy Aune concerning this issue her understanding is that a manual entry will be kicked out unless a cost center is entered for applicable accounts If you have entries to accounts you should replace the profit center with a cost center for entries with a posting date on or after Most profit centers have one or more related cost centers assigned to them per the Standard Hierarchy Report but some do not If your chosen profit center does not have a related cost center let me know Keep in mind that this is only for accts and most of those accounts are not used by our group However we do use some of the accounts such as Interest Income Third Party among others Cost Centers are only needed for these accounts for entries with a posting date of or later If you are doing close entries do them the same as you have been Since we are in the middle of close and this issue does not affect entries I will remind everyone in November to review this issue for

Disposition of Assets Unfortunately the processes that are run automatically by the ISC that eventually book to these accounts will hit a default cost center on each company if one is not specified This is very similar to the derivation pooling profit center The ISC is giving us the opportunity to specify by companyaccount what the default cost center should be for each account Please review the attached spreadsheet below It contains a row for each company and shows the default cost center the ISC has chosen for each account Please respond back to me with the following Confirmation that you have reviewed and agree with the cost center that has been chosen for each account on your company OR An attachment with the changes you desire the ISC to make with regards to your default cost center by account These changes will affect any posting date of November st or later For those of you who have FX revalution on your companies this change will have an effect in October close when the FX

had the default cost centers assigned Accounts in blue The accounts in blue are the new cost elements If there was an existing default cost center for a company we have already assigned it to the new accounts in blue Yellow We selected a default cost center from the values assigned to the default profit center for that company code Green There was not a default profit center so we reviewed the cost centers on that company and selected the one we thought was most appropriate Red This company code did not have any cost centers I have already asked you for these in a previous email If you make changes please move them to a spreadsheet by themselves or make them easy for us to identify in this spreadsheet Thanks again for all your help Accounts posted to automatically by the system Already a cost element before this new process
