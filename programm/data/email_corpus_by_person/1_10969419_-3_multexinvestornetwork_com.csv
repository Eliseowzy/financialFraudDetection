Charles Payne founder CEO and principal analyst Wall Street Strategies The telecommunications sectors equipment makers has been at the root of all the heartache felt by investors over the last twoyears it represents the bloated inventories and even more bloated valuations investors thought they were gliding to a land of early retirements vacation homes and endless toys when the balloon
