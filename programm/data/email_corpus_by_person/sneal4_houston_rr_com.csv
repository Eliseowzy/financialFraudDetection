Subject Joe Bob Briggs Explains How Enron Works How Enron Works The mule market By Joe Bob Briggs a writer for UPI January am Heres how Enron works Its really quite simple Ismail is a successful mule trader in Peshawar Every year Ismail delivers mules to the Kabul Mule Market and gets per mule This year however the Khyber Pass is full of warlord militias so Ismail is not sure he can drive his mules to market without losing a mule here and there Also the demand for mules in Kabul seems to be dropping Maybe hell only be able to sell mules or God forbid and then be forced to feed and water the rest of them on a moneylosing trek back home In other words its a scary market and Ismail is worried about feeding his family What Ismail needs is to limit his risk with an Enron derivatives package First he pays per mule for a Khyber Pass Derivative so that any mule killed or stolen by warlords will be reimbursed at the rate of per mulehalf the going market rate but still better than taking a total loss Next he buys Enron Mule Futures For per contract he guarantees delivery of a mule in three months time He takes of these figuring that a guaranteed mule sale is better than showing up in Kabul and discovering that the mule buyers have been killed by stray bombs Meanwhile at the Enron Mule Trading Desk in Houston eagleeyed yuppies are studying the worldwide mule markets and starting to have their doubts about those delivery contracts Mule use is dropping all over Afghanistan even as the mule count is dwindling Better resell eight of those contracts to a European commodities broker for each then make up that loss somewhere else while cutting the companys exposure in half But how to hedge the risk on the other seven Aha A blip on the computer screen A temporary mule shortage in southern Iran With a current mule price of in Tehran Enron could offer a Linked Mule Swap Double Derivative tied to the gap between the price of mules delivered in Kabul on a given date and the price in Tehran on the same date Sure you would rather have the quickandclean Iran sale instead of the sale in Kabul that requires trucking the mules to a foreign market But even if you add in per mule for transport through militiaheld territory and averaged the markets together you can still clear eight bucks just on the gap alone Enrons average priceperfuturemule is now when you include the permule loss on the mule futures dumped in Europe But based on the amazing KabulTehran trading gap they can easily put together a delivery in either market contract that will allow them to ask per mule on their Mule Online Internet trading system The first mule future sells instantly for and the price bobs up to Two mules go for and then theres a big jump for the last three mules to Enron has now offloaded all its pricebased mule futures liability for a profit of But this doesnt mean theyre out of the mule market in Central Asia Its still two months until Ismail delivers his mules and Enron is on the hook for his Khyber Pass derivative insurance policy Things are not looking good in that part of the world either The chances of a mule being picked off as a roadpassage tax are pretty high and the loss of the whole herd would be a liability Quickly the financial boys go to work and part of that liability is resold to a consortium of Singapore banks Australian mutual funds and Saudi Arabian arms merchant Adnan Kashoggi thereby reducing Enrons percentage to percent or in potential liability against a premium remember the per mule paid by Ismail and Enron also takes a brokerage fee of from the three other partners thereby reducing its real liability to just But thats still too much of a spread so Enron continues to hedge Fortunately the company has such a diversified trading floor that Enron mulemarket experts can walk over to the traders in the warlordmilitia derivatives department Sure enough at least four tribes near the Khyber Pass are increasingly concerned about profit margins There simply arent enough people to rob Things have gotten so bad in fact that the warlords are hedging against the oncoming winter by taking futures positions in stolen chickens stolen humanitarian aid trucks and Western hostages Theres not a mule market yet because the warlords have successfully converted many of the recalcitrant villagers into pack animals But Enron knows how to MAKE markets Quickly the numberscrunchers go to work and they soon determine that the average number of stolen mules per man militia is per year That represents anywhere from to in lost mulethievery income if the Khyber Pass is closed or inhospitable to traders from Pakistan Amortizing that amount over months the warlords have an exposure of anywhere from to per month in lost pillage Hence Enron announces the new Highway Robbery Derivative in which each tribe is guaranteed the value of two stolen mules in each month period in return for paying a premium of per month Enrons hedge is now complete and its a beautiful thing to behold The chances of Ismail losing a mule to a raiding party are approximately one in or percent Since hes paying for his derivative contract the expected loss of percent of his herd would result in a payment of only a more than comfortable spread Meanwhile if the mule is stolen by a warlord holding a Highway Robbery Derivative then the payment to the other side would only be against premiums of If Ismail simply passes through the Khyber Pass without incident and sells all his mules at the standard price Enron pockets from Ismail and each from four warlords in addition to the previous profit of from that heady Internet mulefutures trading day and the in packaging commissions If each warlord steals his standard mules per year then Enron still owes sixtenths of one mule to the warlord or about based on a sale price Total expected profit based on stolen mules one of which is stolen from Ismail Total profit from all Ismailrelated mule transactions See its simple when you know how it works Ask Arthur Andersen Copyright by United Press International
