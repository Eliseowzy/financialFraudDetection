To Stephanie NRON Steven P CT Randall L CT Patti CT Phillip K CT Kristann ES Robert CT Colleen CT Donna CT Ed CT cc Suzanne nron Subject Kern River Segmentation Issue Report from yesterdays technical conference FYI Kern River originally argued that there is no viable segmentation opportunity on its system because there are currently no gas supply sources available to its shippers between the Utah and Nevada markets to source a segmented transport After a technical conference last October Kern River did file a segmentation proposal but Im not sure how much value it would have as a practical matter Note the Southwest Gas arguments summarized in below for allowing backhauls from California to Las Vegas under a segmented agreement Forwarded by Rebecca W CantrellHOUECT on PM Donna NRON PM To Rebecca W CT Leslie nron Suzanne nron cc James D nron Christi L CT Subject Kern River Segmentation Issue Becky I did attend this mornings Kern River technical conference in Docket No RP at FERC The discussion was only on the segmentation proposal made by Kern River They have filed pro forma tariff sheets to allow segmenting of firm contracts at any point segmentation and release subject to a limitation of MD at any overlapping points backhaul from supply pooling points or points where gas is physically received sets out secondary priorities for transportation within the path and outside the path After Kern River made this pro forma filing there were two protests by Dynegy and Southwest Gas Kern River discussed these protests at this technical conference in attempt to resolve all issues Kern River agreed with Dynegys point that a segmenting shipper should retain primary rights to mainline capacity when using points within the original contract path or even when outside of path but the mainline constraint remains the same as within the path However after determining priorities on mainline capacity if constraints occur at specific new points in the segmented transaction then the transaction could be given secondary priority based on the receipt or delivery point capacity Indicated Shippers needed to be assured that their capacity to Wheeler would not be diminished due to this new policy Kern River responded that this is how they have always treated flex points and that because Wheeler was a constrained point any segmented transactions that used Wheeler new would be secondary to the current rights not on the basis of mainline but on the basis of the delivery point scheduling In response to Southwests first issue Kern River also agreed to make changes to provide parity between segmentation for release and segmentation for a shippers own use of transportation If a shipper segments a contract it can get additional primary receipt or delivery point capacity within the path if it is available from the pipeline It was also noted that a shipper can segment a contract that goes from A to C into two transactions A to B and then a backhaul from C to B In doing this since there is no overlapping of mainline capacity both transactions can be at the original MDQ The result could be double the MDQ at the new delivery point B This seems very flexible of Kern River and perhaps more than many other pipelines currently are willing to offer The last issue raised by Southwest was the controversial one and was not resolved at todays technical conference Southwest wants to use its firm transportation contract on Kern River through segmenting to backhaul from Wheeler Ridge delivery point or from PGE delivery point to Las Vegas Kern River currently will provide this kind of service only on a IT basis a separate service to Southwest They claim that this cannot be provided on a firm basis Southwest states that this is displacement service and barring insufficient deliveries at Wheeler or PGE very unlikely according to Southwest could be provided under their firm contract They are willing to take the risk that the capacity would not be available if Kern does not have enough forward haul to Wheeler or PGE Indicated Shippers claimed that this is similar to a service provided by Transwestern however Transwestern offered this as a pipeline firm service Kern River claims that it does not and cannot offer this backhaul as a firm service Kern River also argued that per GISB once gas is scheduled on a firm contract to a secondary point that it is considered firm IT can be bumped intraday and this backhaul service may be bumped Mirant also supported Southwest on this issue because they know of some power plants in the Las Vegas area being built that could use this kind of service Kern River maintained that this service is not required by Order No Kern River will file changes to the pro forma tariff by May Comments by the parties are due June and Kern River can file in reply by June Comments should be emailed to the parties

on hours notice regarding of the term of the proposed recall I believe there are some distinctions relative to the requested term To the extent that there is a perpetual hour RErecall is hours based on date recall is effectuated or the date gas flows pursuant to recall PGE paid million for protection that is not worth very much Just looking for greater clarification To the extent it may help us with our position regarding the ability to turn back the Md of capacity it may be worth the expense to have independent verfication Thanks STeph Original Message From Cantrell Rebecca W Sent Friday August PM To Miller Stephanie Lawner Leslie Cc Tycholiz Barry Subject RE Block III Recall Rights Steph Exactly what are you looking for Im not sure we could give you an opinion of the mechanics If you remember we looked at this issue back in March and I sent you the email message below Since then FERC has issued orders in Docket No RP on and which reaffirmed its rulings in the orders discussed below There is no discussion in any of the orders on the specific mechanics of the recall other than what I already noted namely if the capacity has been recalled by El Paso or a shipper to serve a PGE market and the original shipper wants it back it can rerecall the recalled capacity on hours notice as long as it is using all of its other Block II capacity If you need something more legal well see what we can do If we have to go to Bracewell for a law firm legal opinion there would be a charge since theyd have to do the same research before they could sign off on one From Rebecca W Cantrell PM To Stephanie NRON cc Subject Re block II I would note also that the recent reallocation of Topock rights takes care of one of the issues namely that El Paso allowed Dynegy to take Block II capacity to SoCal Topock The order should have taken care of it except for El Pasos position that they had capacity at Topock in the aggregate so they werent overselling it Order Date Block II Rulings Denial of Rehearing by Operation of Law Denies Indicated Shippers request for rehearing of order Order on Rehearing Enron Clarifies the January order to provide that El Paso may remarket the PGE turnback capacity including Block II for primary delivery to delivery points other than PGE Topock if capacity is available at those other delivery points Order on Negotiated Rate Transactions Enron Williams Block II capacity has primary delivery rights only at PGE Topock and alternative rights at the other Topock delivery points Rejects CPUC argument against the recall provisions which are the same as ultimately accepted in the Dynegy deal see and orders and provide that there is no right of recall if the Block II capacity is simply idle that the capacity may be recalled if it is being used to serve points other than those behind PGE Topock and if so recalled it may be recalled by the original shipper for its own use in the PGE service territory upon hours notice Clarifies as in Dynegy that the shipper Enron must use all its other Block II capacity before recalling other Block II capacity but is not required to use Block I or Block III capacity first Order on Rehearing and Clarification Dynegy Denies rehearing of order Order on Rehearing and Compliance Filing Dynegy Affirms that PGE and the CPUC are entitled to have the Block II capacity recalled to northern California even if it is under contract to Dynegy Reverses previous ruling does not require that all other capacity to California be utilized before Block II capacity can be recalled Per Settlement recalling shipper must pay max rate to recall if its contract is one month or less If for more than one month the rate must equal or exceed the rate of the existing shipper On hours notice the existing shipper ie Dynegy may recall for its own use to serve northern California markets capacity that was recalled for use by other shippers even if those shippers are willing to pay a higher rate Clarifies that if the Block II capacity is idle but is not being used to serve areas outside of northern California Dynegy may hold the capacity without any obligation to release it Letter Order on Compliance Filing Requires the DynegyEl Paso agreement to clearly state that Block II capacity was recallable even though Dynegy had a minimum take requirement Requires El Paso to eliminate use of alternative delivery points as the defining point for the service that would be recalled issue is markets served not delivery points Requires elimination of a clause requiring recalling shipper to submit a sworn statement that no capacity was available on other pipelines Shippers in northern California cannot recall Block II capacity simply because it is not actually being used by Dynegy Block II is recallable if Dynegy is using it to serve end users not within PGEs service territory Shippers who want to recall Block II capacity must have an actual need and may only recall if firm capacity is not available to PGEs service territory via El Paso or via any other pipeline available to the shipper Original Message From Miller Stephanie Sent Friday August AM To Cantrell Rebecca W Lawner Leslie Cc Tycholiz Barry Subject Block III Recall Rights Further to our discussions about our EPNG capacity Our research had resulted in an opinion that there is little value associated with PGEs northern CA customers recall

CT Stephanie NRON Christopher F CT Tim CT Richard nron James D nron Susan J NRON Sandra nron Harry nron Joe NRON Sarah NRON Donna NRON Tom nron Leslie nron Rebecca W CT cc Subject FERC ruling on Kern expansion Kern Gets Speedy OK Breathitt Questions Action FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River Gas Transmission for its MMcfd mostly compression expansion to the natural gasstarved California market but not all of the commissioners were happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort but the precedent we have created could be a doubleedged sword warned Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision Although she voted in favor of the certificate in the end she questioned whether FERC shouldbe willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the socalled California Action expansion of the mileWyomingtoCalifornia Kern River system merited the extraordinary regulatory treatment that the Commission gave it Critics claim that the million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there she noted adding that it would simply displace existing gas It will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in the California marketplace This makes it difficult to understand just how our approval of Kern Rivers proposal is going to assist in increasing electric generation in California this summer Breathitt said If anything she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even worse than it is There should have been a fuller airing of this issue at FERC before the project was certificated she noted It would be counterproductive for this Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without ensuring that they will in reality benefit specific markets and more importantly that they will cause no further harm The Commission majority however readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas and Electric PGE Southern California Gas and other California customers that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing customers They requested that existing customers be given priority over expansion shippers We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines the order said CP For starters the record does not show that prorata allocations of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge Kern River reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at Wheeler Ridge will increase to about MMcfd from MMcfd as a result of this project At the same time the design delivery capacity at the Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about MMcfd from MMcfd to accommodate existing shippers new expansion shippers and Mojave Pipeline shippers it noted Therefore the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes attributable to both PGE and local production that are also delivered to Wheeler Ridge However our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers the order said The solution to the problem of prorata allocations of any services at Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines but rather in fixing the problem with the takeaway capacity and the lack of firm transportation path rights on SoCalGas a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction The project would increase the limitedterm incremental transportation capacity of Kern River by MMcfd from Wyoming to California to help address the urgent need for additional gas in the West An estimated horsepower would be added to the pipeline including three new compressor stations and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and an existing meter station The project which has been fully subscribed has a targeted inservice date of July of this year Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the project with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced by permanent California Expansion Project facilities which is pending at FERC and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of the pipelines and California Expansion Projects The project recently went through an open season

CT Stephanie NRON Christopher F CT Tim CT Richard nron James D nron Susan J NRON Sandra nron Harry nron Joe NRON Sarah NRON Donna NRON Tom nron Leslie nron Rebecca W CT cc Subject FERC ruling on Kern expansion Kern Gets Speedy OK Breathitt Questions Action FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River Gas Transmission for its MMcfd mostly compression expansion to the natural gasstarved California market but not all of the commissioners were happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort but the precedent we have created could be a doubleedged sword warned Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision Although she voted in favor of the certificate in the end she questioned whether FERC shouldbe willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the socalled California Action expansion of the mileWyomingtoCalifornia Kern River system merited the extraordinary regulatory treatment that the Commission gave it Critics claim that the million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there she noted adding that it would simply displace existing gas It will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in the California marketplace This makes it difficult to understand just how our approval of Kern Rivers proposal is going to assist in increasing electric generation in California this summer Breathitt said If anything she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even worse than it is There should have been a fuller airing of this issue at FERC before the project was certificated she noted It would be counterproductive for this Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without ensuring that they will in reality benefit specific markets and more importantly that they will cause no further harm The Commission majority however readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas and Electric PGE Southern California Gas and other California customers that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing customers They requested that existing customers be given priority over expansion shippers We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines the order said CP For starters the record does not show that prorata allocations of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge Kern River reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at Wheeler Ridge will increase to about MMcfd from MMcfd as a result of this project At the same time the design delivery capacity at the Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about MMcfd from MMcfd to accommodate existing shippers new expansion shippers and Mojave Pipeline shippers it noted Therefore the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes attributable to both PGE and local production that are also delivered to Wheeler Ridge However our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers the order said The solution to the problem of prorata allocations of any services at Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines but rather in fixing the problem with the takeaway capacity and the lack of firm transportation path rights on SoCalGas a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction The project would increase the limitedterm incremental transportation capacity of Kern River by MMcfd from Wyoming to California to help address the urgent need for additional gas in the West An estimated horsepower would be added to the pipeline including three new compressor stations and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and an existing meter station The project which has been fully subscribed has a targeted inservice date of July of this year Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the project with the temporary
