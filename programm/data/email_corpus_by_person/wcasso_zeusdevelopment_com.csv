Operationally Focused Concludes an Industry Survey to Be Presented at Interactive Energy Conference Dec HOUSTON TEXAS November After a period of widespread shootatanythingthatmoves investment policy that followed the ERP YK and ebusiness boom oil and gas firms remain aggressive investors in information technology IT but their selections are much more focused on tangible results according to the recent findings of researchers at Booz Allen Hamilton and Zeus Development Corporation The two firms have joined in a research project to interview information officers at many of the worlds leading energy firms to understand how they are currently managing IT investment A final report will be presented at Interactive Energy Wednesday Dec Management are scrutinizing their IT investment opportunities more closely to ensure they return short to mediumterm positive cash flow reports Bob Nimocks president of Zeus For this reason theyre also very interested in finding ways to extend current investments in ERP eprocurement data warehouses and other recent applications The researchers have found that investment policies vary widely from sector to sector In the oilfield services and exploration and production sector IT management have maintained or increased their capital budgets from last year continuing to look for technologies that can lead to large reserve additions or improvements in production The impression is that there is still a lot to be gained from such technologies as reservoir imaging data integration knowledge management and interorganizational collaboration Nimocks said The integrated majors continue to spend significant resources in these areas Downstream refining and petrochemical management on the other hand have no choice but to cut their IT budgets in the face of very tight operating margins Anything more than a year we dont even bother asking said an IT director at a large petrochemical processor Were at the bottom of our business cycle at least I hope we are Out capital expenditure budgets are down about this year compared to last and last year was down about from the previous With deregulation gas and power competitors are in the midst of one of the most profound changes to their industry since its inception Management are very interested in technology to improve their competitiveness within wholesale and retail markets However the Enron financial crisis seems to have spooked the industry for the time being Researchers are finding differences cut across organizational sizes as well Smaller and midmarket firms have cut more quickly in reaction to downturns in market conditions Larger firms remain more committed to longterm plans Many larger firms have changed their governance systems to ensure investments are made with direct benefits A year ago we didnt have to worry about costs reported one information officer of a midsized independent with upstream and chemicals operations Now we
