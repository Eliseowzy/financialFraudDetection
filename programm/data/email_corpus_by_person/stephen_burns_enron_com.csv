TELIA GET G MHZ LICENSES IN DENMARK NEWS IN BRIEF COURT REMANDS COMMISSIONs DENIAL OF U S WEST FORBEARANCE PETITION The US Court of Appeals in Washington DC today remanded a FCC order in which the agency declined a U S WEST Communications Inc now Qwest Corp request to forbear from applying dominant carrier regulation to U S WESTs provision of highcapacity special access and dedicated transport services in Phoenix and Seattle Chief Judge Harry Edwards wrote todays decision in ATT Corp v FCC consolidated cases and which was joined by Judges David Sentelle and A Raymond Randolph The court agreed with U S WESTs contention that the FCC failed to look at all the relevant data before rejecting the forbearance petition The FCC had faulted marketshare data submitted with U S WESTs petition But the court found that the FCC had departed from its traditional nondominance analysis without explanation The FCCs decision to rely on market share data may well be reasonable but until the Commission has adequately explained the basis for this conclusion it has not discharged its statutory obligation under the Administrative Procedure Act the court said In todays order the court also rejected petitions for review filed by ATT and WorldCom Inc They had challenged the forbearance order to the extent that it granted U S WEST pricing flexibility for some services The FCC had granted U S WEST some of the relief it sought on the grounds that its pricing flexibility rules didnt require U S WEST to show a loss of market power The court found that the FCC cant use its pricing flexibility rules as a substitute for its statutory mandate to consider requests for forbearance Congress has established section of the Communications Act of as amended as a viable and independent means of seeking forbearance the court said The Commission has no authority to sweep it away by mere reference to another very different regulatory mechanism SENATE FINANCE MEMBERS GET BEHIND BROADBAND ROLLOUT TAXCREDIT PLAN Former New York Sen Daniel Patrick Moynihan D may have retired but his push to extend tax credits to carriers that deploy highspeed Internet facilities has been revived in the th Congress by key Democrats and Republicans who control the congressional purse strings Yesterday Sen John D Rockefeller IV D WVa joined with more than US senators including freshman Hillary Rodham Clinton D NY to introduce S which is a slightly amended version of Sen Moynihans Broadband Internet Access Act TR June A companion bill is expected next week from House Ways and Means Committee members Phillip English R Pa and Robert T Matsui D Calif This bill represents my commitment to making sure that no community is left behind in the technology revolution Sen Rockefeller said in a statement today Added Sen John F Kerry D Mass a cosponsor Too many business are shying away from areas where broadband access either too expensive or unavailable and underserved areas are put at a tremendous disadvantage Like the Moynihan plan which almost cleared the Senate last year the new bill would provide a taxcredit equal to of a carriers investment in equipment used to provide current generation broadband services to business or residents in rural and lowincome areas The bill defines those services as the transmission of data at a rate of at least megabits per second downstream to the subscriber and at least kilobits per second upstream from the subscriber A taxcredit would be offered to carriers that deploy next generation broadband services to all residential customers according to Sen Rockefeller His bill defines next generation service as the transmission of data at a rate of at least Mbps downstream and at least Mbps upstream A Rockefeller aide said the upstream transmission requirements were lower than last years bill because lawmakers didnt want to cut out any potentially good broadband suppliers like wireless and satellite providers Because the measure would amend the Internal Revenue Code of it has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee where several members already have signed on as cosponsors They include Sens Rockefeller and Kerry Minority Leader Thomas A Daschle D SD Finance Committee ranking Democrat Max Baucus Mont Orrin G Hatch R Utah Olympia J Snowe R Maine Blanche L Lincoln D Ark and Kent Conrad D ND BUSHs EDUCATION PACKAGE PROPOSES ERATE REFORMS As part of his education reform package that was sent to Congress today President Bush is proposing some mild changes to the E rate telecom discount program for schools and libraries They include making the program more flexible changing the application process and reducing some of its burdensome paperwork requirements Those proposals also are likely to be the subject of several hearings slated for early this year in the House telecommunication subcommittee says its Chairman Fred Upton R Mich Under a section of the presidents education plan entitled Enhancing Education Through Technology the Erate program would be combined with other federal technology grant programs to form a single performancebased grant program Burdensome paperwork requirements will be eliminated by sending Erate funds to schools by a formula instead of the current application process it says Flexibility will be increased by allowing funds to be used for purposes that include software purchases and development wiring and technology infrastructure and teacher training in the use of technology the plan states In a letter today to President Bush Rep Upton who also is a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee says he plans to hold a series of hearings to review those proposals He also said Congress and the administration should focus on the issue of broadband deployment particularly as it relates to how increased access to highspeed data services in our homes and schools could vastly improve education opportunities FCC MOVES TO EASE MHz RELOCATION The FCC is taking additional steps to try to facilitate the voluntary relocation of TV broadcasters from the megahertz band to make way for wireless carriers As part of their transition to digital TV DTV the broadcasters dont have to leave the band channels until at the earliest throwing a cloud over the value of the frequencies The spectrum is scheduled to be sold at an auction beginning March but Verizon Wireless has asked for it to be postponed until September In a third report and order the Commission said it will allow the private sector to determine the bandclearing mechanisms that best suit the needs of broadcasters and wireless carriers As a result it has decided not to impose costsharing rules cost caps or costrecovery guidelines at this time it said Last year the agency had asked whether it should impose such rules TR June and July The FCC also has decided to leave to private voluntary efforts the implementation of any secondary auction process rather than running one itself The Commission had asked whether it had the authority to conduct such an auction The latest action builds upon the policies it adopted last year to provide guidance to broadcasters and carriers regarding the regulatory treatment of private bandclearing agreements The agency extended to threeway agreements a general rebuttable presumption adopted last year for bilateral pacts The Commission also provides guidance on interference issues arising from relocation agreements And it has changed its procedures to streamline the review of bandclearing agreements and affirmed it would expeditiously process bandclearing agreements The Commissions action was adopted last week in Wireless Telecommunications docket Cable Services docket and Mass Media docket but a news release on the action wasnt released until last week Commissioner Gloria Tristani dissented in part from the action In a statement she said she opposed the decision to extend the rebuttable presumption to threeway agreements She expressed concern that such agreements will result in a loss of TV service for viewers and said she supported considering bandclearing agreements on a casebycase basis Threeway agreements raise a variety of lossofservice concerns that involve not only voluntary parties to the agreement but neighboring cochannel and adjacent channel broadcasters as well Commissioner Tristani said As I have stated previously my ultimate concern is that the presumption if favor of band clearing reflects a diminishing regard for the public value of free overtheair television services She also took exception with the Commissions statement that it would revisit whether to impose mandatory relocation of broadcasters I remain convinced that such action would contravene the statue establishing broadcasters DTV transition she said WHEELER AGAIN URGES FCC TO LIFT MARKET SPECTRUM CAPS Thomas Wheeler chairman and chief executive officer of the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association again urged the FCC to lift the cap on how much spectrum a carrier may hold in any market while a highlevel effort to identify and allocate thirdgeneration G bands winds its way through the regulatory process At TRDailys late afternoon deadline FCC sources said the Commission was planning to release by the end of the day today a notice of proposed rulemaking exploring whether it should lift the spectrum cap Mr Wheeler told reporters in Washington this afternoon that such access to additional spectrum is crucial for the US to maintain its leadership in developing the Internet as access via wireless devices takes off and spreads worldwide Japan and European countries have moved more quickly to allocate frequencies for G services setting aside twice as much as the US he said The other governments of the world have stolen a page from our play book Mr Wheeler said Mr Wheeler noted that newly named FCC Chairman Michael Powell has indicated he would favor lifting the spectrum cap Clearly in some of the opinions that hes written in the spectrum proceeding hes asked the question Why should this continue Mr Wheeler said Were hopeful Commenting on Verizon Wireless request to postpone the scheduled March auction of megahertz band spectrum Mr Wheeler said the carriers request was legitimate Still CTIA hadnt decided whether it would support it in comments it files with the FCC this week he said Other issues Mr Wheeler said CTIA hopes the FCC or Congress will act on this year include privacy guidelines for locationbased services calling party pays and reciprocal compensation CANNON ESHOO UNVEIL INTERNET PRIVACY BILL Reps Chris Cannon R Utah and Anna Eshoo D Calif today unveiled the Consumer Internet Privacy Act which would require operators of commercial Web sites that collect personally identifiable information to define what type of information is collected and to state how it will be used and who is collecting it The bipartisan bill would allow the Federal Trade Commission to issue civil penalties of up to per violation or a total of Cannon said the bill is a good starting point for addressing the issue of Internet privacy We are going to rely heavily on the marketplace to help define how to implement the guidelines established in this bills language just as the market has commendably worked with government officials to develop other standards and seals for privacy he said Eshoo who said consumers shouldnt have to reveal their life story every time they surf the Web added that privacy must be protected without impeding the free flow of information on the Internet This legislation achieves that goalthe bill doesnt regulate the Internet it empowers the consumer Eshoo said HR also would require Web site operators to give users an opportunity to limit the use and disclosure of their personal information for marketing purposes in a clear conspicuous and easy manner to execute MOBILIX TELIA GET G MHZ LICENSES IN DENMARK Denmark today announced the award of secondgeneration wireless licenses to Mobilix AS and Telia AS The National Telecom Agency had received applications from four

TELIA GET G MHZ LICENSES IN DENMARK NEWS IN BRIEF COURT REMANDS COMMISSIONs DENIAL OF U S WEST FORBEARANCE PETITION The US Court of Appeals in Washington DC today remanded a FCC order in which the agency declined a U S WEST Communications Inc now Qwest Corp request to forbear from applying dominant carrier regulation to U S WESTs provision of highcapacity special access and dedicated transport services in Phoenix and Seattle Chief Judge Harry Edwards wrote todays decision in ATT Corp v FCC consolidated cases and which was joined by Judges David Sentelle and A Raymond Randolph The court agreed with U S WESTs contention that the FCC failed to look at all the relevant data before rejecting the forbearance petition The FCC had faulted marketshare data submitted with U S WESTs petition But the court found that the FCC had departed from its traditional nondominance analysis without explanation The FCCs decision to rely on market share data may well be reasonable but until the Commission has adequately explained the basis for this conclusion it has not discharged its statutory obligation under the Administrative Procedure Act the court said In todays order the court also rejected petitions for review filed by ATT and WorldCom Inc They had challenged the forbearance order to the extent that it granted U S WEST pricing flexibility for some services The FCC had granted U S WEST some of the relief it sought on the grounds that its pricing flexibility rules didnt require U S WEST to show a loss of market power The court found that the FCC cant use its pricing flexibility rules as a substitute for its statutory mandate to consider requests for forbearance Congress has established section of the Communications Act of as amended as a viable and independent means of seeking forbearance the court said The Commission has no authority to sweep it away by mere reference to another very different regulatory mechanism SENATE FINANCE MEMBERS GET BEHIND BROADBAND ROLLOUT TAXCREDIT PLAN Former New York Sen Daniel Patrick Moynihan D may have retired but his push to extend tax credits to carriers that deploy highspeed Internet facilities has been revived in the th Congress by key Democrats and Republicans who control the congressional purse strings Yesterday Sen John D Rockefeller IV D WVa joined with more than US senators including freshman Hillary Rodham Clinton D NY to introduce S which is a slightly amended version of Sen Moynihans Broadband Internet Access Act TR June A companion bill is expected next week from House Ways and Means Committee members Phillip English R Pa and Robert T Matsui D Calif This bill represents my commitment to making sure that no community is left behind in the technology revolution Sen Rockefeller said in a statement today Added Sen John F Kerry D Mass a cosponsor Too many business are shying away from areas where broadband access either too expensive or unavailable and underserved areas are put at a tremendous disadvantage Like the Moynihan plan which almost cleared the Senate last year the new bill would provide a taxcredit equal to of a carriers investment in equipment used to provide current generation broadband services to business or residents in rural and lowincome areas The bill defines those services as the transmission of data at a rate of at least megabits per second downstream to the subscriber and at least kilobits per second upstream from the subscriber A taxcredit would be offered to carriers that deploy next generation broadband services to all residential customers according to Sen Rockefeller His bill defines next generation service as the transmission of data at a rate of at least Mbps downstream and at least Mbps upstream A Rockefeller aide said the upstream transmission requirements were lower than last years bill because lawmakers didnt want to cut out any potentially good broadband suppliers like wireless and satellite providers Because the measure would amend the Internal Revenue Code of it has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee where several members already have signed on as cosponsors They include Sens Rockefeller and Kerry Minority Leader Thomas A Daschle D SD Finance Committee ranking Democrat Max Baucus Mont Orrin G Hatch R Utah Olympia J Snowe R Maine Blanche L Lincoln D Ark and Kent Conrad D ND BUSHs EDUCATION PACKAGE PROPOSES ERATE REFORMS As part of his education reform package that was sent to Congress today President Bush is proposing some mild changes to the E rate telecom discount program for schools and libraries They include making the program more flexible changing the application process and reducing some of its burdensome paperwork requirements Those proposals also are likely to be the subject of several hearings slated for early this year in the House telecommunication subcommittee says its Chairman Fred Upton R Mich Under a section of the presidents education plan entitled Enhancing Education Through Technology the Erate program would be combined with other federal technology grant programs to form a single performancebased grant program Burdensome paperwork requirements will be eliminated by sending Erate funds to schools by a formula instead of the current application process it says Flexibility will be increased by allowing funds to be used for purposes that include software purchases and development wiring and technology infrastructure and teacher training in the use of technology the plan states In a letter today to President Bush Rep Upton who also is a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee says he plans to hold a series of hearings to review those proposals He also said Congress and the administration should focus on the issue of broadband deployment particularly as it relates to how increased access to highspeed data services in our homes and schools could vastly improve education opportunities FCC MOVES TO EASE MHz RELOCATION The FCC is taking additional steps to try to facilitate the voluntary relocation of TV broadcasters from the megahertz band to make way for wireless carriers As part of their transition to digital TV DTV the broadcasters dont have to leave the band channels until at the earliest throwing a cloud over the value of the frequencies The spectrum is scheduled to be sold at an auction beginning March but Verizon Wireless has asked for it to be postponed until September In a third report and order the Commission said it will allow the private sector to determine the bandclearing mechanisms that best suit the needs of broadcasters and wireless carriers As a result it has decided not to impose costsharing rules cost caps or costrecovery guidelines at this time it said Last year the agency had asked whether it should impose such rules TR June and July The FCC also has decided to leave to private voluntary efforts the implementation of any secondary auction process rather than running one itself The Commission had asked whether it had the authority to conduct such an auction The latest action builds upon the policies it adopted last year to provide guidance to broadcasters and carriers regarding the regulatory treatment of private bandclearing agreements The agency extended to threeway agreements a general rebuttable presumption adopted last year for bilateral pacts The Commission also provides guidance on interference issues arising from relocation agreements And it has changed its procedures to streamline the review of bandclearing agreements and affirmed it would expeditiously process bandclearing agreements The Commissions action was adopted last week in Wireless Telecommunications docket Cable Services docket and Mass Media docket but a news release on the action wasnt released until last week Commissioner Gloria Tristani dissented in part from the action In a statement she said she opposed the decision to extend the rebuttable presumption to threeway agreements She expressed concern that such agreements will result in a loss of TV service for viewers and said she supported considering bandclearing agreements on a casebycase basis Threeway agreements raise a variety of lossofservice concerns that involve not only voluntary parties to the agreement but neighboring cochannel and adjacent channel broadcasters as well Commissioner Tristani said As I have stated previously my ultimate concern is that the presumption if favor of band clearing reflects a diminishing regard for the public value of free overtheair television services She also took exception with the Commissions statement that it would revisit whether to impose mandatory relocation of broadcasters I remain convinced that such action would contravene the statue establishing broadcasters DTV transition she said WHEELER AGAIN URGES FCC TO LIFT MARKET SPECTRUM CAPS Thomas Wheeler chairman and chief executive officer of the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association again urged the FCC to lift the cap on how much spectrum a carrier may hold in any market while a highlevel effort to identify and allocate thirdgeneration G bands winds its way through the regulatory process At TRDailys late afternoon deadline FCC sources said the Commission was planning to release by the end of the day today a notice of proposed rulemaking exploring whether it should lift the spectrum cap Mr Wheeler told reporters in Washington this afternoon that such access to additional spectrum is crucial for the US to maintain its leadership in developing the Internet as access via wireless devices takes off and spreads worldwide Japan and European countries have moved more quickly to allocate frequencies for G services setting aside twice as much as the US he said The other governments of the world have stolen a page from our play book Mr Wheeler said Mr Wheeler noted that newly named FCC Chairman Michael Powell has indicated he would favor lifting the spectrum cap Clearly in some of the opinions that hes written in the spectrum proceeding hes asked the question Why should this continue Mr Wheeler said Were hopeful Commenting on Verizon Wireless request to postpone the scheduled March auction of megahertz band spectrum Mr Wheeler said the carriers request was legitimate Still CTIA hadnt decided whether it would support it in comments it files with the FCC this week he said Other issues Mr Wheeler said CTIA hopes the FCC or Congress will act on this year include privacy guidelines for locationbased services calling party pays and reciprocal compensation CANNON ESHOO UNVEIL INTERNET PRIVACY BILL Reps Chris Cannon R Utah and Anna Eshoo D Calif today unveiled the Consumer Internet Privacy Act which would require operators of commercial Web sites that collect personally identifiable information to define what type of information is collected and to state how it will be used and who is collecting it The bipartisan bill would allow the Federal Trade Commission to issue civil penalties of up to per violation or a total of Cannon said the bill is a good starting point for addressing the issue of Internet privacy We are going to rely heavily on the marketplace to help define how to implement the guidelines established in this bills language just as the market has commendably worked with government officials to develop other standards and seals for privacy he said Eshoo who said consumers shouldnt have to reveal their life story every time they surf the Web added that privacy must be protected without impeding the free flow of information on the Internet This legislation achieves that goalthe bill doesnt regulate the Internet it empowers the consumer Eshoo said HR also would require Web site operators to give users an opportunity to limit the use and disclosure of their personal information for marketing purposes in a clear conspicuous and easy manner to execute MOBILIX
