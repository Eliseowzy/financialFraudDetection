<30788044.1075845014821.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,wweiland@velaw.com,2000-11-21 07:29:00,Choice of Mexican Law VitroMonterrey Project Cc Banczak called me yesterday to say that the InterAmerican Development Bank IADB had indicated its refusal to fund its loan to the appropriate ENE borrower in connection with the EnronVitro Monterry Cogeneration Project Project unless the PPAs and construction contracts ie those contracts to be concluded between Mexican entities and calling for performance in Mexico be governed by Mexican law Peggy explained that after long negotiation ENE had been able to convince Vitro and Cementos Apasco and other power purchasersconstruction companies to agree that their contracts be governed by New York law but that despite this great success IADB now for policy reasons was insisting that those contracts be governed by Mexican law Peggy and I talked with Rogelio LopezVelarde and Peggy subsequently provided me copies of three memoranda dated August September and September addressed to Peggy and Robert Stephens of Bracewell Patterson from Rogelio LopezVelarde and Amanada Valdez In the August memorandum Rogelio and Ms Valdez analyzed the enforceability of certain of the provisions of the PPA between Enron Energia Industrial de Mexico S de RL de CV and Apasco should that agreement be governed by Mexican law They recommended certain changes be made if the agreement were to be governed by Mexican law In the September memorandum Rogelio and Ms Valdez gave their opinion on the enforceability of the Suspension Remedy contained in Section of the PPA In their memorandum of September they opined principally that the provision of Section of the PPA specifically denying each Capacity User the right to terminate the PPA except in the case of a Producer Event of Default under Section a sic has occurred and the Project has been Abandoned was unenforceable I have reviewed the three memoranda but I have not reviewed the PPA nor any of the other underlying Project documents As Joe Dilg mentioned to you before we undertook last week our limited review of the EnronVitro Amparo matter we are not Mexican lawyers and therefore we cannot opine on the Lopez Velarde Heftye Abogados memoranda and opinions referenced above and we cannot opine on how the application of Mexican law to disputes that could arise under agreements the IADB now insists be governed by Mexican law might affect the enforceability of provisions of those agreements or the agreements themselves I consider the memoranda provided by the Lopez Velarde Heftye Abogados firm however to be well reasoned and written As I have not seen the underlying documents I am not able to determine whether the August memorandum addresses all of what the drafters characterize as the Challengeable Clauses in the PPA in Section IA My guess is that the form from which the PPA has been developed is a form that ENE has used on other occasions in circumstances that would permit the agreements to be governed by laws of jurisdictions that have experience considering sophisticated commercial disputes at a minimum and perhaps disputes specifically arising under power purchase agreements If ENE does agree to subject interpretation of the PPA and other affected contracts to Mexican law it would be worthwhile to again review the PPA and other affected agreements to be absolutely sure that all of the Challengable Clauses are identified and either changed in a manner acceptable to ENE to make them enforceable or if not changed that the risks of leaving the provisions as is are fully understood and evaluated by ENE I do have the following specific comments concerning the August memorandum If they already have not been made is it possible still to convince the Mexican counter parties to make the changes Lopez Velarde Hefty Abogados have suggested Based on the Lopez Velarde Hefty Abogados memos it seems to me that ENE as a condition to agreeing to accept Mexican law as the governing law would want to negotiate at least the material changes to the PPA suggested by the Lopez Velarde Heftye Abogados firm in the memoranda If it is not possible to negotiate the changes or is possible only to negotiate some of the changes with respect to the Discretionary Performance Prohibition and the Discretionary Condition Prohibition outlined in Sections I A and B would only the specifically applicable Performance or Condition provision be rendered unenforceable or could the PPA in its entirety be deemed unenforceable if either performance of portions of the PPA as opposed to performance of the entire agreement are left to the unilateral discretion of one of the parties or compliance with some as opposed to all of the conditions rests exclusively in the discretion of the obligor Are there any Performance or Condition Prohibitions that individually could be deemed to render unenforceable the entire PPA If there are a number of Performance or Condition Prohibitions that are not amended could they in the aggregate be deemed sufficient to render undenforecable the entire PPA Is there any other Challengable Clause or other clause in the PPA or other affected agreement that without modification to make enforceable should cause ENE not to entier into the PPA or other affected agreement Do the Discretionary Performance or Discretionary Condition Prohibitions constitute events of default even if the party in whose favor they run do not attempt to enforce them constitute an event of default that would afford the innocent party the right to demand rescission of the PPA I understand that the PPA and the affected contracts all contain dispute resolution provisions that would subject disputes to international arbitration Assuming that the dispute resolution provisions are not renegotiated the fact that Mexican law if agreed as the governing law will be interpreted by arbitrators and not Mexican courts is a factor that could result in a more independent consideration and resolution of the interpretation and application of Mexican law to disputes that may arise under the contracts If you have questions or wish to
