Out of the past come the thundering hoof beats of a fiery horse with the speed of light a cloud of dust and a hearty hiyo The Rhone Rangers are riding again from to pm on Saturday March when their fourth annual wine tasting takes place in the Festival Pavilion at San Franciscos Fort Mason The Rhone Rangers is a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating the public about wines made from Rhone grapes grown in the United States To American wine drinkers this will largely mean Syrah but the Rangers recognize a total of grape varieties that are allowed in French Cotes du Rhone including Grenache Mourvedre Carignan Cinsault Marsanne Roussanne and Viognier Rhone grapes have been grown in the United States for years but their status has risen dramatically in the last decade Beginning in the s a looseknit group of nonconformist winemakers apparently bored with Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and aware that California has a Mediterranean climate began experimenting with Rhone varietals and by there were acres of Roussanne Viognier Carignan Grenache Mourvedre and Syrah planted In wineries banded together to form the Rhone Rangers and the following year producers poured their wines for people at the groups first public tasting Today the number of member wineries has increased tenfold including members from such decidedly nonMediterranean locales as Washington Idaho and Virginia Meanwhile the number of attendees at the tasting has tripled Wines poured at the event must contain at least percent Rhone varieties but beyond that regulation variety rules Not only is there a choice of white wines Marsanne Roussanne and Viognier in addition to reds Syrah Grenache Mourvedre Carignan Cinsault but theres also a selection of dry ross a muchloved Rhone staple We suggest that people figure out beforehand how they want to approach the tasting advises Executive Director John Hardman You might just want to taste Syrah or maybe only Roussanne or Marsanne You wouldnt normally go back and forth between red and white but its fairly easy to clear your palate with all the food we have there And we put out plastic cups so people can spit Admission is in advance and the day of the tasting For more information call the Fort Mason box office at or log onto wwwRhoneRangerscom In the meantime check out the selection of Rhone and Rhonestyle wines on winecom IMAGE IMAGE

exception After all some of my favorite Champagnes rich crisp and intensely aromatic are ross and nonbubbly pink wines are absolutely wonderful with food You will quickly find this out by slicing ripe tomatoes and fresh mozzarella layering them on an openfaced baguette seasoning with salt pepper olive oil and a touch of garlic and covering all with a chiffonade of fresh basil This combination is downright yummers with a cool glass of dry ros Pink wines are so thirst quenching in fact that I find its always a good idea to keep a couple around the house For example Andrew Rich Pinot Noir Ros

for the BuckWineries IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE Peter Granoff on Wines for Easter and Passover Easter and Passover are just around the corner raising the question of what wines best accompany these two holidays Nobody is better qualified to discuss this topic than winecom founder Peter Granoff Not only is he a Master Sommelier he was also raised in a JewishCatholic household Peters earliest experience of wine was Manischewitz and Mogen David when he was seven or eight years old My Catholic mother was very active in celebrating Jewish holidays he recalls We were all given a sip of wine though it would have been heavily diluted with water Traditionally or perhaps habitually kosher wines were simple and sweet not the sort of beverage that appeals to grownup connoisseurs like Granoff When kosher wine was first made in this country most of it came from the Concord grape which has a lot of acid and bitter phenolics in the skin Peter explains It was desirable to preserve some sweetness in the wine in order to make it palatable Today though modern winemaking technology has proven beyond any doubt that kosher wine can pass muster as fine wine in every respect And I believe that kosher wine should be good before its anything else the fact that its kosher should be an added benefit Granoff says that all kosher wines on winecom fit this criterion For special mention he singles out the products of Hagafen which he describes as classic Napa Valley wines a fullbodied Merlot a bright and elegant Chardonnay a crisp Sauvignon Blanc and an offdry Riesling Theres also the Barkan Cabernet Sauvignon from the Galil region of Israel a ripe and concentrated Cabernet thats beginning to show some bottle age and some topoftheline Laurent Perrier Champagnes both Brut and Ros Perhaps the ultimate allaround wine for this time of year is the sparkling slightly sweet kosher Bartenura Asti Spumante from Piedmont Italy Its unusual to find an Italian kosher wine but theyre out there Granoff observes Jewish holiday meals often involve an extended family and with three generations at the table youre likely to encounter disparate preferences in wine The older generation might have a bias toward something sweet but a wonderful wine like the Bartenura will also satisfy wine nuts Better yet its only percent alcohol so you can enjoy it without getting hammered For Easter brunch Peter recommends refreshing white wines like Riesling and young fruity Beaujolaisstyle reds Then again since sparkling wine is a lovely and customary accompaniment to brunch why not bring out the Bartenura Asti Spumante here too A kosher Italian sparkling wine for Easter Peter reflects I like that idea IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE Wine Team Picks Lynda Handley on

Tim Gaiser on Heroic Wines Heroic Wines is one of my own personal vino categories A wine is heroic when it has a bold distinct character and far surpasses my expectations in terms of complexity and value Here are my current heroic picks Chateau de Segries Lirac Cuvee Reserve France Domaine de LOratoire StMartin CotesduRhone Villages Carainne Reserve des Seigneurs StMartin France Mas Grand Plagniol Syrah embossed bottle Costieres de Nimes France Peter Lehmann Wines Clancys Barossa Valley Australia dArenberg The Ironstone Pressings McLaren Vale Australia Wine with Chocolate Dry or Sweet The holidays are a time of indulgence and chocolate is pure indulgence Pairing it with wine however is a tricky even controversial endeavor There are two camps those who believe that dry wines like Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon are good with chocolate and those who prefer it with sweet wines says winecom Senior Wine Merchant Tim Gaiser summing up the controversy The drywine camp thinks that the bitterness of tannin is a good match with the bitterness of chocolate says Gaiser It may seem odd to be discussing dessert which most people would consider sweet in terms of bitterness but as Gaiser points out Thats the flavor of cocoa which is found in all highquality chocolate Gaiser believes that some Merlots can handle this assignment because of their soft tannins and the supple seductive quality of their fruit Winecoms sampler gift pack of Ballentine Merlot and Scharffen Berger Chocolate plays on this flavor profile The more traditional palate prefers sweet wines to match the sugar in chocolate and offset its bitterness For this Gaiser says the wine has to be really ripe and intense High alcohol is almost necessary because it implies ripeness and richness In this category he suggests that port is probably best especially tawny port Australian liqueur Muscats like Stanton Killeen are also terrific as are fine cream sherries such as the Bodegas Toro Albala Pedro Ximenez Don Gran Reserva ml or the Emilio Lustau Moscatel Las Cruces Anos Winecom also offers a Decadent Dessert pack that pairs an outstanding Schuetz Oles Port with meltinyourmouth XOX chocolate truffles Although he loves sweet German wines Gaiser steers away from them when it comes to chocolate You need the depth of red grape varieties he says One very influential wine writer thinks that the perfect wine for chocolate is Banyuls Its a Grenachebased red wine fortified to percent alcohol For an alreadyassembled combo try our Banyuls and Chocolate Bars gift pack which includes the LAbbe Rous Banyuls Rimage with six of the finest chocolates available Gaiser also points out that Some Banyuls are capable of aging just like port As proof try the LAbbe Rous Banyuls Grand Cru Christian Reyal If you want to stick to unfortified wine from the United States nothing could be more appropriate than lateharvest Zinfandel whose raspberrytinged varietal character is a classic match with chocolate When it comes to the final ingredient winecom has several firstrate holiday chocolates to offer Some already have wine inside them for example WineFilled Chocolates and Chocolate Champagne Corks For a

del Friuli Italy Zamo Zamo Pinot Grigio Friuli Italy Del Tufo Moscato dAsti Piedmont Italy Champagne with Popcorn Potato Chips and More How did Champagne become the beverage of choice for special events Does it have to be so Winecom Senior Wine Merchant Tim Gaiser tackles the tough holiday questions Champagne became a wine of celebration for one very logical reason Gaiser says The Champagne region played a central role in European history with many coronations in the cathedral at Rheims from the eighth century on Naturally the local wine though not the bubbly version at first was served at these momentous occasions and by the end of the th century Champagne had become the wine of choice for the French court with the rest of Europe soon following suit Champagnes preeminence as a luxury beverage the wine of celebration has been secure ever since Dom Perignon a French Benedictine monk was the first to preserve the tiny bubbles in Champagne Now that its moved beyond European aristocracy says Gaiser Sparkling wines dont have to be limited to special events Their combination of light body crisp acidity and delightful bubbles makes them wonderful aperitifs for any occasion something like Billecart Salmon Champagne Ros for example is just right to rev up the palate for a good meal Once the food arrives Gaiser recommends a bubbly such as the AR Lenoble Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Champagne as the perfect foil for fresh shellfish and caviar This is also an appropriate role for nonvintage sparkling wines like the Maison Guinot Cremant de Limoux Brut Cuvee Imperial Such sparklers are surprisingly good with two decidedly unroyal foods potato chips and freshly popped not microwaved popcorn Sound ridiculous Try it Weightier vintage Champagnes such as Charles Ellner Brut Champagne Seduction work well with lightly sauced fish chicken and veal Gaiser recommends One of the alltime great foodwine pairings is a good ros Champagne such as Billecart Salmon Champagne Ros with poached salmon The color match alone is worth the price of admission but the taste combination is utter heaven TO UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THIS NEWSLETTER go to muvinvvaspeDjdasovicenroncom

States earlier than it can be traced to Italy Zinfandel has been grown and vinified in California since the midth century establishing it as Americas contribution to the world of fine wine While

seasoned group of experts boasting years of collective experience exactly why and how love and wine are linked Here are their professional observations Lee Codding Wine is made with care and passion which cant help but transmit itself to the drinker Its only natural for wine to have a central place in romance because love is an essential ingredient in its production Peter Granoff Candy may be dandy and liquor quicker but nothing extends a romantic moment like a fine wine Maire Murphy When we describe wine we describe its body texture taste and experience That in itself is romantic Diana Jacklich Ever wonder why wine language is rife with such adjectives as sexy seductive smooth velvety and lush Because wine is one of the last legal sybaritic pursuits Carolyn Dempsey Wine evokes sensory pleasure and sustenance which lift the spirit and return us to what really matters Whether its the nourishment of breaking bread and sharing stories or simply the nurturing nature of wine itself which eases the mind and soothes the soul its about taking time to savor the beautiful Maire Murphy There exist some dessert wines that must be sipped only from a womans navel If that isnt romantic what is Julian Davies Of course no woman in her right mind would drop her laundry without half a bottle of Cheval Blanc down her Peter Granoff Wine lovers are wrong when they say that great wine is like sex Great wine is sex The delicacy and tenderness involved in opening a fine old bottle of wine is a kind of foreplay and great wine like the act of love engages us on many levels sensory emotional and intellectual Diana Jacklich The soft extractive note of an aged cork being withdrawn has the true sound of a man opening his heart William Samuel Benwell Jeff Prather Wine makes us giddy with youthful energy it makes us feel warm and fuzzy it causes us to say silly things and mean them it reduces our inhibitions its a sensual magnifier its a powerful muse it makes everything taste better Oh did I say wine Well then wine must be bottled love Peter Granoff Romance engages all the senses as does a fluted glass of Champagne especially when savored by candlelight Its a sensory treat

in wine reviews is tannin Wine writers never seem to tire of references to round tannins ripe tannins smooth tannins tough tannins gentle tannins and supple tannins It begins to seem that if you dont understand tannin you dont understand wine especially red wine So just what the hell is a tannin Tannins are organic compounds in plants trees roots and bark or in the case of wine skins seeds and stems Tastewise tannin doesnt impart a flavor but a texture In concentrated quantities it sticks to the inside of your mouth where it creates a puckering sensation a sensory effect that senior winecom merchant Tim Gaiser likens to that of overbrewed tea Tannin is astringent Gaiser explains If a wine has too much of it its out of balance But tannin isnt a bad thing Its a necessary component for wine to have structure and aging potential In other words the more tannin a wine has the better it will age Not necessarily If a wine has a lot of tannin that isnt balanced by adequate fruit and acidity it wont age well says Gaiser Eventually the fruit will fade leaving nothing but tannin Balance is the key Winemakers and vineyard managers can control tannin in several ways Ripeness of grapes dramatically affects the level and quality of tannins says Gaiser Wines made from grapes that arent fully ripe often have green stemmy hard tannins Ripe tannins are finer and rounder tasting In other words supple Given a suitable climate ripeness and its corollary flavor development results from such factors as low vineyard yields and long growing seasons which allow extended hangtime for the fruit Tannin quality also depends on the amount of time that a winemaker leaves fermenting grape juice must in contact with the skins a process referred to as maceration One of the main reasons California Cabernets have gotten so much better in the last years is that longer maceration times have been used Gaiser says Whats improved more than anything is texture which speaks specifically to tannin management In Bordeaux and California Cabernet maceration times commonly last three weeks or longer a period that enables tannins to grow rounder and gentler Tannin isnt usually associated with white wines because they dont undergo maceration theyre pressed off the skins right away Almost all red grape varieties contain clear juice so the color of red wine is attributable solely to extended skin contact But some white wines do gain tannin from the new oak barrels in which theyre aged A lot of oaky Chardonnays are just as tannic as red wines Gaiser points out People dont usually take that into account which is why Chardonnay can be so difficult to pair with food Click here to try our Studies in Contract Sampler Tannin in Red Wine Valentines Day Special from Proflowerscom What makes

tonguetwisting monikers be damned Piaggia Carmignano Riserva Tuscany Italy Bodegas Escudero Valsacro Crianza Rioja Spain Reinhold Haart Riesling Kabinett Piesporter Mosel Germany Marie Odette Beaujolais Villages Le Perreon Vieilles Vignes Burgundy France Adegas Morgadio Albarino Rias Baixas Galicia Spain Wines of Good Hope South Africa When you hear those two words wine might not be the first thing that comes to mind South African wine has lived in obscurity as far as Americans are concerned acknowledges winecom merchant Lee Codding Because of the countrys political situation the United States had a trade embargo against South Africa until just six years ago But now that we can bring the wines in were beginning to see more availability With vineyards dating back to the th century South Africa is one of the top wineproducing countries in the world Moreover with a Mediterranean climate and spectacular mountain peaks soaring above the grapevines a cross between Napa Valley and the Grand Canyon in the words of winecom chief merchant Peter Marks the area adjoining the Cape of Good Hope is commonly considered the most beautiful wine region in the world According to Marks the end of apartheid in the early s cleared the way for a corresponding revolution in the South African wine industry The first milestone was when the KWV a quasigovernmental wine agency relinquished control over wine pricing production levels and legally defined growing areas says Marks Until then the mainstream industry had considered quality to consist solely of quantity Next an economic breakthrough in capital investment another happy effect of the political transformation brought about enormous improvements in vineyard practices and winemaking technology Like Mandelas release from prison South African wine producers finally have the freedom to do what it takes to catch up with the rest of the wine world says Marks South African wines are coming on strong What wines exactly The most distinctive South African red grape what Zinfandel is to California and Riesling is to Germany says Marks is Pinotage a cross between Pinot Noir and Cinsault that was developed at the University of Stellenbosch in Marks describes its flavor as robust with dark berry spice and earth characteristics Codding likens it to a more rustic and accessible style of Pinot Noir The most widely planted varietal in the country is Chenin Blanc Americans tend to dis Chenin but theyd get pretty excited about it if they tasted these says Codding Theyre made in a really lovely dry LoireValley style South Africa is also catching up to the world in terms of popular varietal selection Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot and Syrah or Shiraz as its called there and in Australia do well in these soils and climate There are also some remarkable Chardonnays and delicious surprisingly ageworthy Sauvignon Blancs For Americans the most intriguing example of the latter might be the creamy complex Simunye We Are One made by Zelma Long formerly of Simi Winery in Sonoma County California Long has been working in South Africa with her husband ex Robert Mondavi vineyardist Phil Freese who has revitalized the vines at Backsberg If this all sounds slightly familiar Codding confirms that South Africa is indeed on the threshold of an Australia situation where the wine industry is about to rise from obscurity to prominence in the marketplace The exchange rate is favorable now so South African wines represent great value For example theres a winery called Cape Indaba that produces really approachable wellmade wines for to dollars a bottle Marks agrees that in the to price range South Africa is a worthy competitor of wines from anywhere in the world He also believes that its long grapegrowing history results in wines with a unique flavor profile The best producers spawn wines with ripe juicy upfront fruit flavors and the inimitable Old World nuance of terroir Marks says The best South African wines are a marriage of Old and New World styles Sound like the best of all possible wine worlds If people give South Africa a try says Marks not only will they discover some wonderful wines but theyll broaden their knowledge expand their taste horizons strengthen the South African wine industry and help stabilize the countrys economy and government All that from a bottle of wine For more

San Luis Obispo County California Pfeffingen Gewurztraminer Spatlese Ungsteiner Honigsackel Pfalz Germany Val Ribeno Crianza Ribera del Duero Spain Wightman Winery Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley California The Incredible Expanding Tasting The View from ZAP A recurring pattern characterizes the annual ZAP Zinfandel Advocates and Producers tasting in San Francisco Every year the peoples grape aka mystery grape and California grape becomes more popular and the tasting boasts more producers and consumers than ever before The number of wines being poured and the number of people waving glasses seems to reach critical mass swelling with such huge and boisterous crowds that it cant possibly get any bigger The following year it increases by percent This was what happened again on the Saturday before the Super Bowl the customary date of the tasting A year ago tasters had flooded the Festival Pavilion at Fort Mason Center this January ZAPs th anniversary the number was For the first time ever the event required two different buildings where a total of wines were poured by wineries Where will it all end Well it finished off the s by showcasing what many were calling the best Zinfandel wines of the decade a spectacular vintage in the words of Ravenswoods Joel Peterson who went on to call it the bestbalanced most complex vintage weve had The wines have some of the fruit complexity of and some of the strength and power of theyre arent overthetop killers in terms of alcohol but they have stuffing underneath Michael Dashe of Dashe Cellars agreed that constitutes manna from heaven The wines are lush concentrated and intense but balanced Donn Reisen of Ridge Vineyards called them awesome full of rich ripe beautiful fruit Bill Easton whose Easton Estate was one of the best Zinfandels of that year felt that the s have a better fruittannin relationship while David Noyes of Kunde Estate found them surprisingly ready to drink I mean theyre big wines Of course winemakers are going to say things like that but the tasting seemed to bear out their claims In terms of quality the Zinfandel vintage surpasses even the vaunted delivering a panoply of balanced wines with full approachable flavors that dont taste particularly alcoholic despite their ripeness To Reisen this is evidence that Zinfandel winemaking is improving along with the quality of the fruit Obviously people are respecting the grape Perhaps too much so abroad if you paid attention to some of the backstage scuttlebutt Other than the beauty of the talk among insiders at the tasting concerned a recent decision by the European Union and expected agreement by the US Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms to allow Italian winemakers to label wines made from the Primitivo grape as Zinfandel ZAP has supported research into Zinfandels European origins resulting among other things in the scientific conclusion that it and the Primitivo di Puglia are the same grape The Italians called it Primitivo for a hundred years noted Reisen But now that Zinfandel is so popular theyre trying to steal the brand All the research really means is that Primitivo is a clone of Zinfandel said Ridges president and winemaker Paul Draper The Italian move is purely commercial Its like what happened in the old days with Champagne and Burgundy and Chablis Americans tried to capitalize on names that the French had taken years to build ZAP was created to promote Zinfandel not Primitivo but when you get down to it who really cares If with its climate and soil Puglia thinks it can compete with the best Zinfandel in the world more power to them Leon Sobon of Sobon Estates is going the opposite way In Amador County in the Sierra Nevada foothills hes making Primitivo from a clone imported from Italy Sobon reported that Primitivo is easier to grow than Zinfandel resulting in more of a claret wine with less berry character If you want to find out for yourself try the Sobon Estates Primitivo In any case ZAP is going on the offensive not with legal action against the Italians but with EuroZAP its first international tour As you read this a series of dinners tastings workshops and seminars featuring Zinfandel wines and winemakers is now taking place in England Germany and other European countries The aim explained ZAP Executive Director Rebecca Robinson is to educate the world that

Plagniol Syrah embossed bottle Costieres de Nimes France Peter Lehmann Wines Clancys Barossa Valley Australia dArenberg The Ironstone Pressings McLaren Vale Australia Wine with Chocolate Dry or Sweet The holidays are a time of indulgence and chocolate is pure indulgence Pairing it with wine however is a tricky even controversial endeavor There are two camps those who believe that dry wines like Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon are good with chocolate and those who prefer it with sweet wines says winecom Senior Wine Merchant Tim Gaiser summing up the controversy The drywine camp thinks that the bitterness of tannin is a good match with the bitterness of chocolate says Gaiser It may seem odd to be discussing dessert which most people would consider sweet in terms of bitterness but as Gaiser points out Thats the flavor of cocoa which is found in all highquality chocolate Gaiser believes that some Merlots can handle this assignment because of their soft tannins and the supple seductive quality of their fruit Winecoms sampler gift pack of Ballentine Merlot and Scharffen Berger Chocolate plays on this flavor profile The more traditional palate prefers sweet wines to match the sugar in chocolate and offset its bitterness For this Gaiser says the wine has to be really ripe and intense High alcohol is almost necessary because it implies ripeness and richness In this category he suggests that port is probably best especially tawny port Australian liqueur Muscats like Stanton Killeen are also terrific as are fine cream sherries such as the Bodegas Toro Albala Pedro Ximenez Don Gran Reserva ml or the Emilio Lustau Moscatel Las Cruces Anos Winecom also offers a Decadent Dessert pack that pairs an outstanding Schuetz Oles Port with meltinyourmouth XOX chocolate truffles Although he loves sweet German wines Gaiser steers away from them when it comes to chocolate You need the depth of red grape varieties he says One very influential wine writer thinks that the perfect wine for chocolate is Banyuls Its a Grenachebased red wine fortified to percent alcohol For an alreadyassembled combo try our Banyuls and Chocolate Bars gift pack which includes the LAbbe Rous Banyuls Rimage with six of the finest chocolates available Gaiser also points out that Some Banyuls are capable of aging just like port As proof try the LAbbe Rous Banyuls Grand Cru Christian Reyal If you want to stick to unfortified wine from the United States nothing could be more appropriate than lateharvest Zinfandel whose raspberrytinged varietal character is a classic match with chocolate When it

for the BuckWineries IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE Peter Granoff on Wines for Easter and Passover Easter and Passover are just around the corner raising the question of what wines best accompany these two holidays Nobody is better qualified to discuss this topic than winecom founder Peter Granoff Not only is he a Master Sommelier he was also raised in a JewishCatholic household Peters earliest experience of wine was Manischewitz and Mogen David when he was seven or eight years old My Catholic mother was very active in celebrating Jewish holidays he recalls We were all given a sip of wine though it would have been heavily diluted with water Traditionally or perhaps habitually kosher wines were simple and sweet not the sort of beverage that appeals to grownup connoisseurs like Granoff When kosher wine was first made in this country most of it came from the Concord grape which has a lot of acid and bitter phenolics in the skin Peter explains It was desirable to preserve some sweetness in the wine in order to make it palatable Today though modern winemaking technology has proven beyond any doubt that kosher wine can pass muster as fine wine in every respect And I believe that kosher wine should be good before its anything else the fact that its kosher should be an added benefit Granoff says that all kosher wines on winecom fit this criterion For special mention he singles out the products of Hagafen which he describes as classic Napa Valley wines a fullbodied Merlot a bright and elegant Chardonnay a crisp Sauvignon Blanc and an offdry Riesling Theres also the Barkan Cabernet Sauvignon from the Galil region of Israel a ripe and concentrated Cabernet thats beginning to show some bottle age and some topoftheline Laurent Perrier Champagnes both Brut and Ros Perhaps the ultimate allaround wine for this time of year is the sparkling slightly sweet kosher Bartenura Asti Spumante from Piedmont Italy Its unusual to find an Italian kosher wine but theyre out there Granoff observes Jewish holiday meals often involve an extended family and with three generations at the table youre likely to encounter disparate preferences in wine The older generation might have a bias toward something sweet but a wonderful wine like the Bartenura will also satisfy wine nuts Better yet its only percent alcohol so you can enjoy it without getting hammered For Easter brunch Peter recommends refreshing white wines like Riesling and young fruity Beaujolaisstyle reds Then again since sparkling wine is a lovely and customary accompaniment to brunch why not bring out the Bartenura Asti Spumante here too A kosher Italian sparkling wine for Easter Peter reflects I like that idea IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE Wine Team Picks Lynda Handley on

Out of the past come the thundering hoof beats of a fiery horse with the speed of light a cloud of dust and a hearty hiyo The Rhone Rangers are riding again from to pm on Saturday March when their fourth annual wine tasting takes place in the Festival Pavilion at San Franciscos Fort Mason The Rhone Rangers is a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating the public about wines made from Rhone grapes grown in the United States To American wine drinkers this will largely mean Syrah but the Rangers recognize a total of grape varieties that are allowed in French Cotes du Rhone including Grenache Mourvedre Carignan Cinsault Marsanne Roussanne and Viognier Rhone grapes have been grown in the United States for years but their status has risen dramatically in the last decade Beginning in the s a looseknit group of nonconformist winemakers apparently bored with Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and aware that California has a Mediterranean climate began experimenting with Rhone varietals and by there were acres of Roussanne Viognier Carignan Grenache Mourvedre and Syrah planted In wineries banded together to form the Rhone Rangers and the following year producers poured their wines for people at the groups first public tasting Today the number of member wineries has increased tenfold including members from such decidedly nonMediterranean locales as Washington Idaho and Virginia Meanwhile the number of attendees at the tasting has tripled Wines poured at the event must contain at least percent Rhone varieties but beyond that regulation variety rules Not only is there a choice of white wines Marsanne Roussanne and Viognier in addition to reds Syrah Grenache Mourvedre Carignan Cinsault but theres also a selection of dry ross a muchloved Rhone staple We suggest that people figure out beforehand how they want to approach the tasting advises Executive Director John Hardman You might just want to taste Syrah or maybe only Roussanne or Marsanne You wouldnt normally go back and forth between red and white but its fairly easy to clear your palate with all the food we have there And we put out plastic cups so people can spit Admission is in advance and the day of the tasting For more information call the Fort Mason box office at or log onto wwwRhoneRangerscom In the meantime check out the selection of Rhone and Rhonestyle wines on winecom IMAGE IMAGE

exception After all some of my favorite Champagnes rich crisp and intensely aromatic are ross and nonbubbly pink wines are absolutely wonderful with food You will quickly find this out by slicing ripe tomatoes and fresh mozzarella layering them on an openfaced baguette seasoning with salt pepper olive oil and a touch of garlic and covering all with a chiffonade of fresh basil This combination is downright yummers with a cool glass of dry ros Pink wines are so thirst quenching in fact that I find its always a good idea to keep a couple around the house For example Andrew Rich Pinot Noir Ros

certain amount of wine snob labeling always bolsters the rationale Still if the only bottle you can imagine bringing is a Chateau Margaux might I suggest a few gems with attributes worthy of schlepping in theyre unlikely to be found on a restaurant wine list but theyre guaranteed to enhance your dining experience Archery Summit Winery Vireton Willamette Valley Oregon Baileyana Pinot Noir San Luis Obispo County California Pfeffingen Gewurztraminer Spatlese Ungsteiner Honigsackel Pfalz Germany Val Ribeno Crianza Ribera del Duero Spain Wightman Winery Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley California The Incredible Expanding Tasting The View from ZAP A recurring pattern characterizes the annual ZAP Zinfandel Advocates and Producers tasting in San Francisco Every year the peoples grape aka mystery grape and California grape becomes more popular and the tasting boasts more producers and consumers than ever before The number of wines being poured and the number of people waving glasses seems to reach critical mass swelling with such huge and boisterous crowds that it cant possibly get any bigger The following year it increases by percent This was what happened again on the Saturday before the Super Bowl the customary date of the tasting A year ago tasters had flooded the Festival Pavilion at Fort Mason Center this January ZAPs th anniversary the number was For the first time ever the event required two different buildings where a total of wines were poured by wineries Where will it all end Well it finished off the s by showcasing what many were calling the best Zinfandel wines of the decade a spectacular vintage in the words of Ravenswoods Joel Peterson who went on to call it the bestbalanced most complex vintage weve had The wines have some of the fruit complexity of and some of the strength and power of theyre arent overthetop killers in terms of alcohol but they have stuffing underneath Michael Dashe of Dashe Cellars agreed that constitutes manna from heaven The wines are lush concentrated and intense but balanced Donn Reisen of Ridge Vineyards called them awesome full of rich ripe beautiful fruit Bill Easton whose Easton Estate was one of the best Zinfandels of that year felt that the s have a better fruittannin relationship while David Noyes of Kunde Estate found them surprisingly ready to drink I mean theyre big wines Of course winemakers are going to say things like that but the tasting seemed to bear out their claims In terms of quality the Zinfandel vintage surpasses even the vaunted delivering a panoply of balanced wines with full approachable flavors that dont taste particularly alcoholic despite their ripeness To Reisen this is evidence that Zinfandel winemaking is improving along with the quality of the fruit Obviously people are respecting the grape Perhaps too much so abroad if you paid attention to some of the backstage scuttlebutt Other than the beauty of the talk among insiders at the tasting concerned a recent decision by the European Union and expected agreement by the US Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms to allow Italian winemakers to label wines made from the Primitivo grape as Zinfandel ZAP has supported research into Zinfandels European origins resulting among other things in the scientific conclusion that it and the Primitivo di Puglia are the same grape The Italians called it Primitivo for a hundred years noted Reisen But now that Zinfandel is so popular theyre trying to steal the brand All the research really means is that Primitivo is a clone of Zinfandel said Ridges president and winemaker Paul Draper The Italian move is purely commercial Its like what happened in the old days with Champagne and Burgundy and Chablis Americans tried to capitalize on names that the French had taken years to build ZAP was created to promote Zinfandel not Primitivo but when you get down to it who really cares If with its climate and soil Puglia thinks it can compete with the best Zinfandel in the world more power to them Leon Sobon of Sobon Estates is going the opposite way In Amador County in the Sierra Nevada foothills hes making Primitivo from a clone imported from Italy Sobon reported that Primitivo is easier to grow than Zinfandel resulting in more of a claret wine with less berry character If you want to find out for yourself try the Sobon Estates Primitivo In any case ZAP is going on the offensive not with legal action against the Italians but with EuroZAP its first international tour As you read this a series of dinners tastings workshops and seminars featuring Zinfandel wines and winemakers is now taking place in England Germany and other European countries The aim explained ZAP Executive Director Rebecca Robinson is to educate the world that Zinfandel is grown in California and that its Americas Heritage Wine To check out winecoms entire Zinfandel selection click here Watch winecom TV Join us on the next Wine for Everyone show on

Beaujolais Villages Le Perreon Vieilles Vignes Burgundy France Adegas Morgadio Albarino Rias Baixas Galicia Spain Wines of Good Hope South Africa When you hear those two words wine might not be the first thing that comes to mind South African wine has lived in obscurity as far as Americans are concerned acknowledges winecom merchant Lee Codding Because of the countrys political situation the United States had a trade embargo against South Africa until just six years ago But now that we can bring the wines in were beginning to see more availability With vineyards dating back to the th century South Africa is one of the top wineproducing countries in the world Moreover with a Mediterranean climate and spectacular mountain peaks soaring above the grapevines a cross between Napa Valley and the Grand Canyon in the words of winecom chief merchant Peter Marks the area adjoining the Cape of Good Hope is commonly considered the most beautiful wine region in the world According to Marks the end of apartheid in the early s cleared the way for a corresponding revolution in the South African wine industry The first milestone was when the KWV a quasigovernmental wine agency relinquished control over wine pricing production levels and legally defined growing areas says Marks Until then the mainstream industry had considered quality to consist solely of quantity Next an economic breakthrough in capital investment another happy effect of the political transformation brought about enormous improvements in vineyard practices and winemaking technology Like Mandelas release from prison South African wine producers finally have the freedom to do what it takes to catch up with the rest of the wine world says Marks South African wines are coming on strong What wines exactly The most distinctive South African red grape what Zinfandel is to California and Riesling is to Germany says Marks is Pinotage a cross between Pinot Noir and Cinsault that was developed at the University of Stellenbosch in Marks describes its flavor as robust with dark berry spice and earth characteristics Codding likens it to a more rustic and accessible style of Pinot Noir The most widely planted varietal in the country is Chenin Blanc Americans tend to dis Chenin but theyd get pretty excited about it if they tasted these says Codding Theyre made in a really lovely dry LoireValley style South Africa is also catching up to the world in terms of popular varietal selection Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot and Syrah or Shiraz as its called there and in Australia do well in these soils and climate There are also some remarkable Chardonnays and delicious surprisingly ageworthy Sauvignon Blancs For Americans the most intriguing example of the latter might be the creamy complex Simunye We Are One made by Zelma Long formerly of Simi Winery in Sonoma County California Long has been working in South Africa with her husband ex Robert Mondavi vineyardist Phil Freese who has revitalized the vines at Backsberg If this all sounds slightly familiar Codding confirms that South Africa is indeed on the threshold of an Australia situation where the wine industry is about to rise from obscurity to prominence in the marketplace The exchange rate is favorable now so South African wines represent great value For example theres a winery called Cape Indaba that produces really approachable wellmade wines for to dollars a bottle Marks agrees that in the to price range South Africa is a worthy competitor of wines from anywhere in the world He also believes that its long grapegrowing history results in wines with a unique flavor profile The best producers spawn wines with ripe juicy upfront fruit flavors and the inimitable Old World nuance of terroir Marks says The best South African wines are a marriage of Old and New World styles Sound like the best of all possible wine worlds If people give South Africa a try says Marks not only will they discover some wonderful wines but theyll broaden their knowledge expand their taste horizons strengthen the South African wine industry and help stabilize the countrys economy and government All that from a bottle of wine For more

Team Picks Julian Davies on Sainted Brothers Wines Its widely known that yesterday February was St Valentines Day But now that youre finished pandering to the candyman can you name the saints who are honored today I thought as much February is a day that commemorates St Faustinus and St Jovita Born in northern Italy in the second century this pair of brothers preached the word with such fervor that they enraged a heathen lord named Julian no relation who ordered them arrested and tortured Ultimately Emperor Hadrian had them beheaded A modern analogue of Faustinus and Jovita might be Ethan and Joel Coen a pair of steadfast siblings who have maintained their filmic faith despite ceaseless heathen persecution the most recent result being their movie O Brother Where Art Thou Hence herewith

in wine reviews is tannin Wine writers never seem to tire of references to round tannins ripe tannins smooth tannins tough tannins gentle tannins and supple tannins It begins to seem that if you dont understand tannin you dont understand wine especially red wine So just what the hell is a tannin Tannins are organic compounds in plants trees roots and bark or in the case of wine skins seeds and stems Tastewise tannin doesnt impart a flavor but a texture In concentrated quantities it sticks to the inside of your mouth where it creates a puckering sensation a sensory effect that senior winecom merchant Tim Gaiser likens to that of overbrewed tea Tannin is astringent Gaiser explains If a wine has too much of it its out of balance But tannin isnt a bad thing Its a necessary component for wine to have structure and aging potential In other words the more tannin a wine has the better it will age Not necessarily If a wine has a lot of tannin that isnt balanced by adequate fruit and acidity it wont age well says Gaiser Eventually the fruit will fade leaving nothing but tannin Balance is the key Winemakers and vineyard managers can control tannin in several ways Ripeness of grapes dramatically affects the level and quality of tannins says Gaiser Wines made from grapes that arent fully ripe often have green stemmy hard tannins Ripe tannins are finer and rounder tasting In other words supple Given a suitable climate ripeness and its corollary flavor development results from such factors as low vineyard yields and long growing seasons which allow extended hangtime for the fruit Tannin quality also depends on the amount of time that a winemaker leaves fermenting grape juice must in contact with the skins a process referred to as maceration One of the main reasons California Cabernets have gotten so much better in the last years is that longer maceration times have been used Gaiser says Whats improved more than anything is texture which speaks specifically to tannin management In Bordeaux and California Cabernet maceration times commonly last three weeks or longer a period that enables tannins to grow rounder and gentler Tannin isnt usually associated with white wines because they dont undergo maceration theyre pressed off the skins right away Almost all red grape varieties contain clear juice so the color of red wine is attributable solely to extended skin contact But some white wines do gain tannin from the new oak barrels in which theyre aged A lot of oaky Chardonnays are just as tannic as red wines Gaiser points out People dont usually take that into account which is why Chardonnay can be so difficult to pair with food Click here to try our Studies in Contract Sampler Tannin in Red Wine Valentines Day Special from Proflowerscom What makes

seasoned group of experts boasting years of collective experience exactly why and how love and wine are linked Here are their professional observations Lee Codding Wine is made with care and passion which cant help but transmit itself to the drinker Its only natural for wine to have a central place in romance because love is an essential ingredient in its production Peter Granoff Candy may be dandy and liquor quicker but nothing extends a romantic moment like a fine wine Maire Murphy When we describe wine we describe its body texture taste and experience That in itself is romantic Diana Jacklich Ever wonder why wine language is rife with such adjectives as sexy seductive smooth velvety and lush Because wine is one of the last legal sybaritic pursuits Carolyn Dempsey Wine evokes sensory pleasure and sustenance which lift the spirit and return us to what really matters Whether its the nourishment of breaking bread and sharing stories or simply the nurturing nature of wine itself which eases the mind and soothes the soul its about taking time to savor the beautiful Maire Murphy There exist some dessert wines that must be sipped only from a womans navel If that isnt romantic what is Julian Davies Of course no woman in her right mind would drop her laundry without half a bottle of Cheval Blanc down her Peter Granoff Wine lovers are wrong when they say that great wine is like sex Great wine is sex The delicacy and tenderness involved in opening a fine old bottle of wine is a kind of foreplay and great wine like the act of love engages us on many levels sensory

events Does it have to be so Winecom Senior Wine Merchant Tim Gaiser tackles the tough holiday questions Champagne became a wine of celebration for one very logical reason Gaiser says The Champagne region played a central role in European history with many coronations in the cathedral at Rheims from the eighth century on Naturally the local wine though not the bubbly version at first was served at these momentous occasions and by the end of the th century Champagne had become the wine of choice for the French court with the rest of Europe soon following suit Champagnes preeminence as a luxury beverage the wine of celebration has been secure ever since Dom Perignon a French Benedictine monk was the first to preserve the tiny bubbles in Champagne Now that its moved beyond European aristocracy says Gaiser Sparkling wines dont have to be limited to special events Their combination of light body crisp acidity and delightful bubbles makes them wonderful aperitifs for any occasion something like Billecart Salmon Champagne Ros for example is just right to rev up the palate for a good meal Once the food arrives Gaiser recommends a bubbly such as the AR Lenoble Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Champagne as the perfect foil for fresh shellfish and caviar This is also an appropriate role for nonvintage sparkling wines like the Maison Guinot Cremant de Limoux Brut Cuvee Imperial Such sparklers are surprisingly good with two decidedly unroyal foods potato chips and freshly popped not microwaved popcorn Sound ridiculous Try it Weightier vintage Champagnes such as Charles Ellner Brut Champagne Seduction work well with lightly sauced fish chicken and veal Gaiser recommends One of the alltime great foodwine pairings is a good ros Champagne such as Billecart Salmon Champagne Ros with poached salmon The color match alone is worth the price of admission but the taste combination is utter heaven TO UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THIS NEWSLETTER go to muvinvvaspeDjdasovicenroncom
