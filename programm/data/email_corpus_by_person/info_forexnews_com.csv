optimism in the face of weak earnings reports US economic data this week will give a better clue as to how severe the d ownturn will be Most forecasts are expected to show sharp declines and con firm the US edged closer to recession after the September attacks on the United States Final October releases include the Conference Boards confi dence survey Chicago PMI NAPM the Labor report this weeks jobless clai ms and the key Q GDP preliminary report This will be the most widely watc hed release because if the Q GDP figure proves to be worse than the negati ve expected it will have a doubly harsh effect on USD as traders also anticipate a larger decline in the October Labor report In contrast ha lf the Eurozone nations will be on holiday this Thursday which will lead t o thin markets and

decision to hold interest rates near zero ZIRP and maintain a floor of trillion yen in reserves did not impress FX markets But inaction was ex pected and offers to sell USD above capped any dollar

in FY and FY The BoJ boards full outlo ok for FY GDP ranged from to FY CPI ranged from to However the banks own figures are not seen as making any diff erence in monetary policy because BoJ Governor Hayami sees structural refor m as the key to growth not more money In other news Finance Minister Sh iokawa said the government will still aim for the trillion JGB cap but should remain flexible to unforeseen changes in economic environment But w orrying markets is what those unforeseen changes might be If that includ es todays downward revision to growth and inflation then markets will be very disappointed with the new Koizumi governments promise of reform Any violation of this key reform is likely to push the yen lower Shiokawa als o said standards should be set for banks to foreclose on borrowers with exc essive debts There are companies that are borrowing from banks that haven t paid any dividends to shareholders for some years whose debts have been forgiven but are still unable to recover Banks should be able to foreclo se on such firms he said There should be a set of standards that makes it easier for banks to do so That would be one way of resolving bad loans The Financial

level would likely call upon further steep losses as the single currency has consistently failed t o maintain above cents Temporary moves higher are not seen by the marke t as indicating strength and are regarded as selling opportunities dealer s say The euro is likely to remain under pressure in the near term after sliding across the board on Wednesday following European Central Bank presi dent Duisenbergs assertion that interest rates are on hold for the time be ing and that Germanys rising budget deficit was a further concern By stra ightjacketing Germany the ECB has nearly assured that the economys engine of growth will continue to lag behind the rest of the Eurozone A more po sitive response is expected from Greenspan today after markets concluded th at the Fed Chairman probably sounded more pessimistic about the economy tha n he intended in his speech on January Moreover given the recent squab ble between Democrats and Republicans over who wasted the surpluses Greens pan is also is likely to be questioned on his support for last years tax c uts which Democrats claim are responsible for the elimination of budget sur pluses and subsequent return to deficits The US budget surplus was once p rojected to total more than trillion over the next years but recent estimates by the Senate Budget Committee show that the recession is likely to cost billion on top of the bln that will go to present and future tax cuts Senate majority leader Daschle is likely to argue for a s uspension of future tax cuts But Greenspan may reiterate his support for tax cuts to hasten and ensure a rebound especially since it would spur con sumer spending and stem the reduction in business investment He will also likely say that the budget became a deficit due to the recession and the r esultant war following the September attacks Nevertheless the recent budget deficits projected by the CBO on Wednesday sent the bond market ree ling as interest rates on year Treasuries jumped to almost from as the deficit figures were higher than some analysts predicted This cou ld also be a point of contention among Democrats who know Greenspan to endo rse lower long term interest rates over deficit spending Meanwhile marke ts will also listen to Greenspans assessment of the economy to gauge wheth er there is a chance of a rate cut at the Jan meeting Interest rate fut ures are pricing in only a chance leaving the majority to believe rate s will hold steady at a year low However since the dollar index is trading near month highs most dealers are now divided over whether a further rate cut would help the dollar Following Greenspan the market i s likely to react to earnings announcements and the economic outlook from c ompanies such as Eli Lilly Eastman Kodak Gateway JDS Uniphase McDonald s Nokia Phillips Petroleum PMCSierra Qualcomm and RJ Reynolds Tobacc o Holdings who are reporting today But it is Greenspans assessment of th e economy that is likely to direct Wall Street and the dollar While most believe the recession will be over this year the key concern now is that e conomists and investors are again uncertain as to how strong growth will be when it resumes The first question is whether investment spending will re cover substantially now that inventory liquidation has run its course The second question is whether consumer final demand will be strong enough in to warrant new business spending The risk is that consumers will be slow to take on additional debt given their current debt loads and this w ill cause the recovery to take another fall called a double dip until t here is a more profound correction from past over investment This can be s een in recent Wall Street losses as investors question the likelihood of fu ture earnings growth this year

Holdings the worlds biggest bank by assets which fell Earlier this month the banking sector encountered a sell off w hich drove the Nikkei to year lows until the Japanese government announc ed it was ready to shore up the troubled sector But there is a reason for government apprehension For instance the more aggressively the governmen t pursues the disposal of nonperforming loans NPL the more it will incr ease unemployment and deflation thus depressing the economy even further i n the short run Therefore Japan will talk tough but likely take a less agg ressive approach towards large institutions by again throwing money at the problem Instead of getting rid of all problem loans which would bankrupt many debtors a kinder approach like the bailout of the Daiei retail chai n will

after BoE Governor George today tried again to talk down the currency Geor ge said sterling strength exacerbates the imbalances the central bank would like to correct Therefore a fall would help the BoE do its job to get th e economy on one track again Usually central bankers like a strong curren cy because it allows for lower interest rates and flexibility on monetary p olicy But with RPIX

consumer spending could moderate sharply Therefore sterling remains wea k after backtoback surprise declines in UK retail sales were seen as a si gn that consumer spending could have peaked last year

outright JGB purchases to one trillion yen a month fro m billion also had an initial supportive effect as it was seen easing f unding pressures next month But the yens gains evaporated as markets saw little hope in the Japanese governments antideflation package The yen s hould not fall too much from the increase in liquidity even though it is su pposed to mean a weaker yen because there is more of the currency circulati ng Instead since increasing liquidity in Japan is ineffectual amid struct ural barriers causing rampant deflation and lack of demand the yen has resp onded less and less to recent increases in liquidity because it is not lea ding to inflation and therefore not diminishing the value of the yen Desp ite BoJ Governor Hayamis remark that todays easing was not politically mo tivated Hayami has made public his desire now for the government to inject public funds into the troubled banking sector Whether there was a quid pr o quo agreement remains to be seen PM Koizumis antideflation package avo ided any concrete plan to rescue banks but Hayami worries that without a re capitalization Japanese banks will be threatened with losing international banking licenses because their capital ratios have fallen to below internat ional standards Government has tried to avoid a publicly unappealing tax payer fund injection instead opting for creating a floor under asset price s which will keep banks capital adequacy ratios above the limit set by t he BIS But an injection of funds would allow banks to write off nonperfor ming loans and improve their balance sheets

the B oJ said in the monthly report This was the sixth straight month the Bank c ited weakening private consumption and falling corporate profits at banks a nd the deterioration in the manufacturing sector will add weakness to domes tic demand it said Following another downgrade in Japans economic outl ook it now appears that FY tax revenue will probably be revised down by Y trln from Y trln according to the MoF Therefore sticking to PM Koizumis important reform to limit JGB issuance to trillion yen in FY will be difficult In order to achieve this further expenditure cuts will be needed which will likely find strong opposition within Koizumis own L DP party Japanese FinMin Shiokawa maintained that the government would lim it new issuance to Y trln but more LDP lawmakers are now openly requesti ng further fiscal stimulus Aggravating the situation is that tax projectio n for FY is most likely to be revised down further Adding pressure to t he yen is the fact that the BoJ decided by majority vote to keep monetary p olicy unchanged last week It had eased in August and again in September bu t has since been keeping a waitandsee stance Interest rates are still ne ar zero

there is a certain chance now that the developm ents could come out better than feared If and when it is true that the war in Afghanistan is over that could give some important psychological impet us he said Switzerland is so dependent on world trade that of course we cannot escape from developments abroad he said Moreover the SNB aimed to conduct monetary policy so that our interest rates are as low as possib le in order to provide relief for the economy but so that at the same time we do not endanger price stability he added Inflation in Switzerland i s below one percent On Friday Roth said in an interview with the Financi al Times that the Swiss francs role as a safehaven currency is declining because of the emergence of the euro Thus Roth felt more at ease that the Swiss franc is reverting to the status of a normal currency as it becomes less important as a financial asset The Swiss National Bank has been dism ayed by the appreciation in the Swiss franc as investors sought shelter ami dst recent political uncertainty thereby prompting the central bank to cut rates Roth asserted that if we were to face large capital inflows we wou ld have to respond through monetary policy and interest rates because it is an illusion to think that we have other instruments that we could use to curb inflows Upside capped at and Support holds at and Todays US data is expected to
