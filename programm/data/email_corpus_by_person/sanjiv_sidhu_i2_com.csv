Monopoly money is printed in a year than real money printed throughout the world Did you also know that we would greatly appreciate your participation in our survey see below This report is available in PDF format k at piperpublicgotoassetspdfsbbbboctpdf II Survey Says Thanks again to everyone that took the time to respond to our survey We will conduct similar surveys in the future in order to keep our fingers ever closer to the pulse of ebusiness activity We greatly appreciate your input This surveys results were interesting and provided us with quite a bit of insight At the same time the responses to many questions were conflicting reflecting the current state of uncertainty within the sector and the overall economy The surveys participants came from a wide variety of professions though more than came from consulting firms and software companies Please find an overview of the responses we received for each of the questions grouped by category along with commentary below Recovery Have we reached a bottom in terms of the decline of corporate spending on ebusiness initiatives Unsurprisingly there was wide disagreement on this topic with of respondents replying probably yet countering with probably not Probably Probably not Definitely not Not even close When will we see a meaningful uptick in corporate spending on ebusiness initiatives There was also disagreement on this topic though expect an uptick at some point during True bulls the who answered Q and true bears the that selected or later were few in number Q Early Late or later In our view we may have reached a bottom during the September quarter as this quarter is seasonally weak in any year and this year witnessed one of the most challenging and paralyzing times that the United States has encountered in years However we do not necessarily expect to see a significant uptick during the next few quarters as we expect the economy and corporate earnings which ultimately drive capital expenditure and IT budgets to weaken further during that time The key question is when corporate executives will sense a stabilization in their businesses and thus begin to feel more confident about investing IT Spending Priorities And Architecture Please rank the following application categories in terms of strategic importance to the organization and likelihood of receiving IT budget approval over the next months Of the categories available for selection supplychain management ranked No closely followed by customer relations management CRM eprocurement and application integration Human capital management product life cycle management and application server software were at the bottom of the list Supplychain management CRM eProcurement Application integration BIAnalytics ERP Application server software Product life cycle management Human capital management How important a consideration is Internet architecture when evaluating ebusiness software products The soft economy does not appear to have tempered enthusiasm for new technology as answered critical with another responding somewhat important This was summed up by one participant who wrote the traditional software model is dead the importance of pure Webnative architecture is critical to unleashing the full potential of interenterprise ebusiness initiatives Only responded not very important or does not matter In light of these responses it should come as no surprise that the vast majority of vendors are now moving at breakneck speed to bring truly Webbased products to market Critical Somewhat important Not very important Does not matter Marketplaces And Portals Despite the spectacular rise and fall of public marketplaces many participants remain bullish on marketplace technology Additionally most respondents envision portals emerging as a central part of the IT ecosystem though response here was less positive than for marketplaces Will the use of emarketplaces private public or other eventually be an important piece of a corporations ebusiness initiatives More than answered positively with saying without a doubt responding probably and only saying definitely not As our readers have seen us comment many times we believe that the bulk of future marketplace activity will be centered around private marketplaces Without a doubt Probably Probably not Definitely not Will corporate portals eventually constitute the main window through which users are able to access multiple heterogeneous software applications along with relevant content analytic analysis Slightly less than responded in the affirmative with saying without a doubt and responding probably While we agree that portal technology is important we believe that the jury is still out on whether or not this will prove to be a profitable standalone product offering Without a doubt Probably Probably not Definitely not Suite Versus BestOfBreed Respondents were by and large not in the suite camp though they drew a clear distinction between emerging and mature technologies Which approach will win over the long run a bestofbreed approach or buying an entire suite from a single vendor Only voted in favor of the suite approach though only voted for bestofbreed The majority opted for the more neutral answer that bestofbreed will win when dealing with emerging technologies and the suite approach will win when dealing with more mature technologies The comments of one participant stressed the difference between missioncritical and lessimportant functionality and offered hope for smaller vendors particularly those with vertical focus He wrote corporations will opt for bestofbreed software where it addresses part of their mission critical activities but will opt for a suite activities that are not central to their core business As a result many niche vendors will emerge as very important particularly those that correctly and deeply solve specific problems in a given vertical Best of breed Suite Bestofbreed will win when dealing with emerging technologies and the suite approach will win when dealing with more mature technologies Obstacles To Adoption Regarding obstacles to adoption there was little consensus among respondents though it was clear that many obstacles remain and remain challenging With respect to obstacles that inhibit broader adoption of ebusiness software solutions please rank the obstacles below All obstacles listed came in neckandneck for the lead with user adoption challenges of changing business process and behavior topping the list One person commented success of implementation resides in a companys ability to manage change and understand that this is not a system added or a plugin but a new approach to the existing way their businesses is conducted Regarding integration challenges with existing internal applications one participant wrote integration of applications in a timely and costeffective manner continues to be the single most important challenge facing ebusiness adoption The challenges involved with data mapping was also cited as another key obstacle by one respondent User adoption challenges of changing business process and behavior Integration challenges with existing internal applications High cost and lengthy time of implementation Questionable or insufficient ROI Integration challenges with external business partners Market leadership Who will be the most important ebusiness software vendor in five years On this front participants ranked Microsoft No followed closely by Oracle SAP and IBM Sun also appeared as a writein candidate However stressing the everentrepreneurial nature of the ebusiness software sector one respondent commented it is very possible that the most important ebusiness software vendor will be a start up who is not on anybodys radar screen yet Microsoft Oracle SAP IBM Siebel PeopleSoft i BEA Systems As always we welcome your thoughts and feedback Regarding this survey specifically we would be particularly interested to hear your opinions on the results along with your thoughts on additional topics that are worth exploring in future surveys IV WEEKLY NEWS top Retek Inc won a followon
