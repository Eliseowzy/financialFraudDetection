isnt the administration endorsing bold measures October am Crucial to winning the global war against terrorism is a bold plan to wage war on the domestic recession But Washington has no such plan Respected policymakers look timid cautious and out of touch with the reality of a declining economy Veteran graybeards advise Congress to do nothing seemingly deaf to an economic call to arms The latest unemployment claims report ratcheted up nearly to a nineyear high This implies a huge drop in jobs and a big jump in unemployment is on the way A just published and miserable durablegoods report says the technology sector is evaporating in cyberspace Over the three months ending in August a composite hightech index for shipments dropped at an annual rate Technology was the biggest contributor to the economic boom of the s Now it is the biggest drag Even consumers are suffering from terrorist aftershock as weekly chainstore sales are turning negative Something has got to be done but Washington isnt doing it The Bush administrations economic officials have been ineffectual There is no actionplan script no talking points no communication strategy In short theres no leadership on the domestic economic front The administration is performing brilliantly in the early stages of the war against terrorism But thus far it has shown no similar instincts in the war against domestic recession If the domestic slump is left unattended the nation will eventually become demoralized Without economic vitality at home it will be all the more difficult to maintain our edge overseas Rising unemployment drains the spirit but we need exactly that spirit to conquer our enemies The economy needs a jolt It needs risktaking But policymakers seem unwilling to take risks Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan who keep telling us that too much stimulus will cause inflation are providing more statusquo thinking at the very moment we need leaders who can size up the current situation and then think outside the box to provide solutions Mr Rubins arguments about budget surpluses and longterm bond rates are red herrings at best Actually as the recessiondriven federal budget moves into deficit Treasury market interest rates are dropping to year lows undercutting Rubins entire argument on the need to maintain budget surpluses at any economic cost He has never understood that growth produces surpluses rather than the other way around The former Clinton Treasury man tells us that demandside consumer tax rebates are okay while supplyside tax cuts on successful highend earners and capital investments are not Go figure This is not economic analysis Its a plain vanilla liberalredistribution agenda Mr Greenspan meanwhile says that capitalgains tax cuts are not the best way to deal with the economys shortterm problem Yet it is exactly the deflation of capital asset values through the stockmarket decline and the deepening slump in business profits that cries out for new incentive rewards for capital investment Instead of pompous proclamations lets do an historical scrub of the aftereffects of capgains relief If we do it will show that faster economic growth rising stock markets and stronger budget revenues always follow lower taxrates on capital investment Jack Kemp and Sen Zell Miller have it exactly right in their editorial proposal to slash cap gains accelerate the depreciation of investment in plant equipment and technology and make the phasedin personal taxrate reductions effective immediately Their monetary view that the Federal Reserve should abandon its interest rate target in favor of larger emergency cash injections is also correct So why arent administration economists endorsing these bold measures Why arent they making the case that its business that creates jobs and that business desperately needs a fresh capital infusion No amount of consumer tax rebates will stop the unemployment rate from rising if capitalstarved and profitlosing businesses dont get immediate relief from a permanent reduction of taxrates Bush policymakers should also make the case that the twin crises of war and recession will require a temporary budget deficit of roughly of GDP billion to finance taxcuts defense and infrastructurerebuilding policies that are necessary to reignite economic growth The public is foursquare behind the president in the global war against terrorism It will also stand foursquare behind the president in the war against recession Indeed the public knows that a strong domestic economy is vital to the war effort Since President Bushs spectacular speech rallying the nation for the global war against terrorism the Dow Jones stock index has appreciated or roughly points If the president rallies the nation with a war plan to end recession the market will rise exponentially signaling economic recovery and the revival of the American spirit

money Alan July am Alan Greenspan went through his Terminator III act last week pledging to the Congress and the nation that he and the Federal Reserve will do all that it takes to finance economic recovery Of course the heavyweight central banker has already reneged on his earlier forecast that recovery would come in the second half Its now July which begins the second half and there is no recovery And in a rare moment of candor he told the House Financial Services Committee that the US economy is not out of the woods yet So the great monetary leader left the door wide open for additional easing moves During his testimony Greenspan was especially proud of Fed efforts to reignite moneysupply growth as a prorecovery measure This is a good thing because it was the Feds massive deflation of money last year that completely leveled the stock markets and put us in the fix we are in today The trouble with all this macho moneycreation is that you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink While the Fed is beginning to pump more highpowered cash into the economy a public that is still reeling from the aftereffects of stockmarket shock refuses to put any of that money to productive use in the economy Investors recoiling from a vicious NASDAQ drop and an even worse total wipe out of the dotcoms are not yet willing to take any economic risks As a result things like venturecapital funds and initial public offerings the capitalinvestment seed corn that funds the most innovative and risky new enterprises necessary to move the country to the next level of technologydriven prosperity arent being financed Nobody it seems wants to commit the first new dollar This is what John Maynard Keynes meant when he talked about sagging animal spirits in the s So wheres all the Feds new cash going Moneymarket funds where savers get a riskfree guaranteed return Year to date retail and institutional money funds are rising at an eyepopping annual rate or just about billion a month This is more than twice last years pace Trouble is this sort of investment is basically for little old ladies in tennis shoes Its not the aggressive hightech entrepreneurial risk taking that will fund the next great idea the one that could transform the economy and increase productivity Until this mosscovered riskaverse psychology changes the Fed can drop interest rates to zero and dump cash into the economy by the wheelbarrow But the economy will not improve So how might government policy makers turn this story around If they provided new taxcut incentives for investment they might just unlock risktaking spirits and get the Feds money working productively in the economy The odd part about Bushs taxcut plan is that the expected flood of rebates this year is designed to stimulate consumer spending the investment incentiveeffects from lower tax rates dont kick in for another years But consumer spending isnt the problem In fact thats the only area keeping us out of recession Its the collapse of businessinvestment spending that has been the principal economic illness especially technologyrelated investments which have completely dried up Policy makers should be focused on the supply side of the economy not the demand side Clever use of further tax cuts this time to encourage capital spending may help prevent those widespread job cuts that would ultimately guarantee a recession writes Brian Nottage of The Dismal Scientist Nottage recommends accelerated depreciation allowances that would permit a quick writeoff for companies investing in new equipment This is exactly what former Reagan Treasury advisor Steve Entin supports Mr Entin is backing the High Productivity Investment Act a bipartisan bill crafted by Reps Phillip English R Pa and Richard Neal D Mass This measure would let businesses claim the full cost of their investment in hightech equipment as a business expense in the year it was purchased and would also shorten the time period for all other equipment purchases According to Entin faster writeoffs would lower the cost of utilizing equipment and increase capital formation resulting in higher labor productivity real wages and employment Another taxcut measure that would surely reawaken investment spirits would be a reduction in the tax rate on capital gains An increase in the aftertax return of investing in securities also implies a decrease in the expected profits investors require from currently hurting companies writes the dismal scientist Mr Nottage The selffinancing capitalgains tax cut in the mids provided a booster rocket to stock markets and economic growth Investment tax cuts would encourage savers to take new risks and would put Fed money creation to real work Whenever aftertax rewards are sweetened more investment is sure to follow With energy costs coming down along with lower inflation and interest rates the sickly economy will surely mend over time But the question is how quickly and at what pace will this economic mending occur A new round of investment tax cuts will give Terminator III Greenspan some real clout

isnt the administration endorsing bold measures October am Crucial to winning the global war against terrorism is a bold plan to wage war on the domestic recession But Washington has no such plan Respected policymakers look timid cautious and out of touch with the reality of a declining economy Veteran graybeards advise Congress to do nothing seemingly deaf to an economic call to arms The latest unemployment claims report ratcheted up nearly to a nineyear high This implies a huge drop in jobs and a big jump in unemployment is on the way A just published and miserable durablegoods report says the technology sector is evaporating in cyberspace Over the three months ending in August a composite hightech index for shipments dropped at an annual rate Technology was the biggest contributor to the economic boom of the s Now it is the biggest drag Even consumers are suffering from terrorist aftershock as weekly chainstore sales are turning negative Something has got to be done but Washington isnt doing it The Bush administrations economic officials have been ineffectual There is no actionplan script no talking points no communication strategy In short theres no leadership on the domestic economic front The administration is performing brilliantly in the early stages of the war against terrorism But thus far it has shown no similar instincts in the war against domestic recession If the domestic slump is left unattended the nation will eventually become demoralized Without economic vitality at home it will be all the more difficult to maintain our edge overseas Rising unemployment drains the spirit but we need exactly that spirit to conquer our enemies The economy needs a jolt It needs risktaking But policymakers seem unwilling to take risks Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan who keep telling us that too much stimulus will cause inflation are providing more statusquo thinking at the very moment we need leaders who can size up the current situation and then think outside the box to provide solutions Mr Rubins arguments about budget surpluses and longterm bond rates are red herrings at best Actually as the recessiondriven federal budget moves into deficit Treasury market interest rates are dropping to year lows undercutting Rubins entire argument on the need to maintain budget surpluses at any economic cost He has never understood that growth produces surpluses rather than the other way around The former Clinton Treasury man tells us that demandside consumer tax rebates are okay while supplyside tax cuts on successful highend earners and capital investments are not Go figure This is not economic analysis Its a plain vanilla liberalredistribution agenda Mr Greenspan meanwhile says that capitalgains tax cuts are not the best way to deal with the economys shortterm problem Yet it is exactly the deflation of capital asset values through the stockmarket decline and the deepening slump in business profits that cries out for new incentive rewards for capital investment Instead of pompous proclamations lets do an historical scrub of the aftereffects of capgains relief If we do it will show that faster economic growth rising stock markets and stronger budget revenues always follow lower taxrates on capital investment Jack Kemp and Sen Zell Miller have it exactly right in their editorial proposal to slash cap gains accelerate the depreciation of investment in plant equipment and technology and make the phasedin personal taxrate reductions effective immediately Their monetary view that the Federal Reserve should abandon its interest rate target in favor of larger emergency cash injections is also correct So why arent administration economists endorsing these bold measures Why arent they making the case that its business that creates jobs and that business desperately needs a fresh capital infusion No amount of consumer tax rebates will stop the unemployment rate from rising if capitalstarved and profitlosing businesses dont get immediate relief from a permanent reduction of taxrates Bush policymakers should also make the case that the twin crises of war and recession will require a temporary budget deficit of roughly of GDP billion to finance taxcuts defense and infrastructurerebuilding policies that are necessary to reignite economic growth The public is foursquare behind the president in the global war against terrorism It will also stand foursquare behind the president in the war against recession Indeed the public knows that a strong domestic economy is vital to the war effort Since President Bushs spectacular speech rallying the nation for the global war against terrorism the Dow Jones stock index has appreciated or roughly points If the president rallies the nation with a war plan to end recession the market will rise exponentially signaling economic recovery and the revival of the American spirit
