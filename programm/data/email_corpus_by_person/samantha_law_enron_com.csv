like me to follow up with Norman or somebody else Thanks Sam Original Message From Yang Zhiyun Sent Thursday January PM To Law Samantha Cc Lee Norman Subject RE Testing Request Hi Sam I owed you the answer to this question for too long Let me make it up First of all Hypothetic curve shift is defined as the difference of MarktoMarket value between current price curve and current price curve perturbed by specified amount for peak hours Note that the offpeak hour curve stays unchanged but that doesnt mean you can ignore the offpeak part of the deal since it will have impact on the overall average price I think it easier to go through an example to show the point Please see post id I set up in which we will examine a forward deal for the day The deal is for hours and MWhour From the spreadsheet below you can see how the original daily price is after shift to the peak hour price the new daily price is the discount Vol for the day is hence the final hypothetic curve shift is or Same logic to get the hypothetic curve shift for etc It follows the same logic for option deals although the result will not be linear like for swap There seem to be a unwanted feature in current executable which combined the hypothetic curve shift for different shift into the bucket we will fix that in future release but if you want the right executable now you can find it at homezyangpwrcalchcs Please let me know if you have further questions Zhiyun Original Message From Law Samantha Sent Wednesday January PM To Yang Zhiyun Subject RE Testing Request Haha a little reminder for you just thought that you might have time to look at this in the meanwhile Thanks Sam Original Message From Yang Zhiyun Sent Tuesday November AM To Law Samantha Subject RE Testing Request Hi Sam You are an exemplary employee of Enron Ill do what I can to get back to you on this but at this point I really cannot promise the time line So hows everything with you Zhiyun Original Message From Law Samantha Sent Tuesday November AM To Yang Zhiyun Subject FW Testing Request Hey Z Would you have time to work on this this week I will be on vacation for the most of Dec so if you could get me some more hints that would be great Thanks Sam Original Message From Law Samantha Sent Monday November PM To Yang Zhiyun Subject RE Testing Request Hey Zhiyun Since I dont have much going on here I am afraid I need to keep bugging you on this p Anyway I have picked a region that has bigger HCS numbers so that we can notice the difference easier LTSW R I have attached my results for your reference From what I see is if I am using the right report Swap Details and if my formula is right then the number I got to verify the accuracy of the HCS report is quite different from the actual result For example I took and to calculate the HSC number using the formula I thought is right Assuming the HCS is only based on Peak curves and strips HCS calculated HCS report Again if you could take a look when you have the time to take a breathe that would be great Thanks Sam PS hows everything going in Houston in terms of what people are reacting to the merger Do you feel a lot of worries around Portland is ok people in general are not too worried File EPMILTSWRswpdtlNovDecxls File EPMILTSWhcrvshiftxls Original Message From Yang Zhiyun Sent Tuesday November PM To Law Samantha Subject

Thanks Sam Original Message From Law Samantha Sent Friday November AM To Yang Zhiyun Subject RE Testing Request Hi Zhiyun I have just run a calc again for LTCali I have attached the HCS report and the Swap Detail for R for your reference Based on what you said should I expect there is HCS figures for since I have quite a large MTM value for deals flow during as in Swap Details Could you please find out why I dont see any numbers in the HCS report for Or am I missing something Thanks Sam File EPMILTCALIhcrvshiftxls File EPMILTCALIRswpdtlxls Original Message From Yang Zhiyun Sent Friday November AM To Law Samantha Subject RE Testing Request Its the flow date You are welcome Zhiyun Original Message From Law Samantha Sent Friday November AM To Yang Zhiyun Subject RE Testing Request Hi Zhiyun Thanks for helping me out with this So for the Month column in the HCS report is it referring to the flow date for the deals or deal date Thanks Sam Original Message From Yang Zhiyun Sent Wednesday October PM To Law Samantha Lee Norman Subject RE Testing Request Hi Sam Norman was caught up with too many projects recently let me try to chip in a little What the HCS report has is the what if results that is how much PL change we will see should PEAK HOUR price moves up etc For example if your current day MtM is if peak price goes up by your MtM will be say then the difference will be reported in the HCS report Hope this help you get started I guess HCS report has not been reviewed for quite a while but I think at least the swap part should still be fine Please let us know if you notice anything wrong Zhiyun Original Message From Law Samantha Sent Wednesday October PM To Lee Norman Cc Yang Zhiyun Subject RE Testing Request Hi Norman I know its only Wed butdo you have a status

Thanks Norman Original Message From Law Samantha Sent Friday October PM To Lee Norman Yang Zhiyun Subject FW Testing Request Hi Norman and Zhiyun As I have bugged you both a little bit about this already I hope you wont mind helping me even a bit more p Anyway I ran an unofficial calc earlier today on LTNW Post ID with the Hypothetical Curve Shift on It generated the attached HCS report My question is can you give me the formula the PortCalc used to calculate those HCS columns especially for SwapHCS I want to get a better idea of how they are calculated first before I can verify the accurancy of them Thank you so much Sam PS Zhiyun I havent run a mini book on a basis option yet I thought I should start with the more basic firstthanks for your advice though File EPMILTNWhcrvshiftxls Original Message From White Stacey W Sent Friday October AM To Chang Fran Dunton Heather Law Samantha Postlethwaite John Warner Nicholas Subject FW Testing Request There is a report in PortCalc Hypothetical Curve Shift Monthly that I would like someone to review for accuracy It is meant to have price increments that indicate what curve shift would have been had the curve been adjusted by that increment In order for this report to be generated you have to choose the Hypothetical Curve Shift option in PortCalc see below OLE Object PBrush Please let me know who will be doing this analysis and if you need any help Thanks Stacey
