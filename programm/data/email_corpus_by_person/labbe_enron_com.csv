Thanks Anne Labbe HR Representative Original Message From Enron NRON mailtoIMCEANOTESEnronAnnouncementsCorpEnron NRONcom On Behalf Of Jeff Skilling President and NRON Sent Wednesday May PM To All Enron NRON Subject Changes to PRC Process MEMORANDUM TO All Employees FROM Jeff Skilling DATE May SUBJECT Changes to PRC Process Enrons midyear Performance Review process is now underway The PRC system is the backbone of Enrons meritocracy and is a critical part of the process of managing rewarding and moving talent The system allows us to provide degree feedback on employee performance to evaluate skill levels across Enron on a relative basis to align individual performance with compensation decisions and to inform our staffing decisions The PRC process begins when you access the Performance Evaluation Process PEP system and suggest reviewers who can best speak about your performance Once all the feedback is received your supervisor will use it to assist in determining your performance relative to your peers in the same job group in a Performance Review Committee meeting In the meeting supervisors make a rating recommendation supported by a description of the individuals performance during the review period and an indication of the feedback received The decision of the committee on relative performance must be unanimous for all employees under review At the end of last year we asked you to provide us with feedback on how we could improve the PRC process without compromising the philosophy behind the system Based on your comments and suggestions the PRC Committee and the Enron Policy Committee have agreed upon several modifications that will streamline the process These changes include online access to the PEP system through our ClickAtHome portal shorter forms changes to the rating system and the opportunity to provide feedback on your supervisor These changes are outlined in detail below Eligibility In an effort to ensure that new employees have amassed a sufficient track record and are evaluated appropriately a minimum of six months tenure at Enron will be required before an employee is included and evaluated in a PRC meeting Consequently employees hired after December will not be included in the midyear PRC ratings process These employees will nevertheless solicit and receive feedback via the PEP system and must receive a final evaluation from their managers Because of the opportunity for rapid development in the AnalystAssociate Program all Analysts and Associates with a minimum of three months tenure hired prior to March will be included and rated in a PRC meeting Nonexempt Employees Nonexempt employees administrative and clerical will not be rated in a formal PRC meeting Individual Business Units or groups may choose to discuss their nonexempt employees but this is not required The sole requirement for nonexempt employees is that they receive a rating of and bonus eligible and not bonus eligible They will continue to solicit feedback via the PEP system and as in the past they must receive a written final evaluation from their supervisor Rating Clusters Last year we used the following descriptors to determine relative rating superior excellent strong satisfactory needs improvement and issues Many employees believed that these descriptors were not useful in light of the relative evaluation process So this year we will use numerical relative ratings of with being the highest Those in categories are bonus eligible those in category are not bonus eligible For those in category the consequences besides not receiving a bonus include implementation of a Development Plan or in the event of continuing performance issues consideration of ongoing employment Preferred Distribution Consistent with the relative rating approach employees performance will be grouped in accordance with the following distribution level level level level level This grouping requires PRC committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at Enron as well as to identify top talent for special recognition There is flexibility in the system but every organization must exercise informed discretion to meet a distribution that reflects that organizations overall effectiveness and need for improvement Ensuring higher quality reviews In the past employees and their supervisors could select an unlimited number of reviewers This approach reduced the quality of the written feedback with many forms filled out only with rating information To ensure higher quality written reviews the PEP system will limit the number of reviewers an employee may select for feedback to a maximum of Additionally the PEP forms have been revised to encourage more written feedback and reduce reliance on ratings Feedback Forms The degree feedback forms have been reduced to one page however the system will accommodate more detailed written feedback Unsolicited Feedback In the event an individual is not selected as a reviewer but wants to provide feedback on an employee he or she may do so via the Unsolicited Feedback feature in PEP Unsolicited Feedback is in addition to the maximum of seven reviews Selfevaluation Form The selfevaluation form has been revised to provide employees with a forum to list their accomplishments during the review period The employees list of accomplishments will be available for viewing by the PRC committee during the meeting Reviewing your supervisor Employees will have the opportunity to review their supervisors and to rate the effectiveness of their supervisors delivery of feedback Disclosure of Ratings Disclosure of a rating in cluster is mandatory across the organization disclosure of ratings in clusters is at the supervisors discretion Access through ClickAtHome US employees will be able to access and complete feedback and selfevaluation forms through the ClickAtHome portal at This will provide employees the convenience to complete these forms at home or at the office PRC is part of our competitive edge It is our goal to make you aware of any changes to the process and system as soon as we are able to do so If you have any questions regarding PRC or PEP I encourage you to speak with your supervisor contact your HR representative or email mailto PEP opens May feedback closes on May PRC Meetings will take place from June The
