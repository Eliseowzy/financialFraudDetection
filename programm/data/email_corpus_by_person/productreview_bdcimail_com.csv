Weinberg For the Reviewmeister theres nothing like the smell of real time data in the morning Historical data is nice but its realtime data that gets the blood pumping So we took a close look at LiveHealth from Concord Communications LiveHealth collects realtime data and reports it in an easytounderstand comprehensive and timely fashion Like any new product LiveHealth has its pros and cons It produces excellent reports and supports more than kinds of SNMPaware devices But it cant display a networks topology doesnt offer corrective actions and wasnt all that easy to install LiveHealth starts at and is part of Concords suite that includes Network Health System Health and Application Health modules LiveHealth actively polls SNMPmanageable devices determines their status and condition and displays the result in real time LiveHealth can present its reports via a browserbased interface a serverbased console and Adobe Acrobatbased reports It also can send device status and condition data to network management products such as HewlettPackards OpenView LiveHealth is complex software In addition to its sophisticated network monitoring and reporting elements it comes with the CERN Web server for rendering management data and reports as Web pages an Open Ingres database engine for storing network device data and The Santa Cruz Operations XVision PC Xserver which LiveHealths server console uses to display screen data LiveHealths discovery process is quick and accurate By default LiveHealth discovers network nodes daily at midnight At minute intervals or less often if you wish the SNMP polling process probes the condition and status of network devices LiveHealth understands a plethora of Management Information Bases and it correctly recognized Lucent and Cisco routers Samsung and Com switches and the other devices in our test network LiveHealth can tell you if a device is performing as its supposed to but it cant produce graphical maps showing network hierarchies It stores collected network device information for six weeks in the Open Ingres database In its first few days LiveHealth builds a baseline of normal network behavior Then it can detect outoftheordinary events such as excessively high or low traffic through a router or switch port Once LiveHealth detects a problem a network administrator can choose to monitor the problem device in what Concord calls fast mode LiveHealth polls the device in frequencies up to twice a minute to help the administrator track the situation LiveHealth doesnt offer external alerting functions such as email or paging but relies instead on links to thirdparty programs such as HPs OpenView to provide such notifications or take corrective actions The strength of the program is reports that show device information by time period relationship to the organizational structure and type of behavior or exception We could see devices that had experienced problems by type of problem as well as those associated with a particular application LiveHealth runs on HPUX Solaris Windows NT and The documentation is comprehensive but should include a better roadmap to help users find the various software component discussions in the manuals LiveHealths installation was more difficult than we expected but we found that LiveHealths focus on performance and its extensive reporting are just what the

the most important LAN questions Yours This FREE Network World Town Meeting brings you facetoface with industry leaders willing to share their ideas insights experiences and vision So you have the knowledge to plan build support and secure your LAN now and in the future For more information on this event visit goahtml Todays focus Configure this By Neal Weinberg The Reviewmeister loves to get solid reliable information on the state of my network But if I get too much information I get a migraine And if I dont get enough I worry that I may be missing something So I checked out two tools that are supposed to give me just the right amount of network information Configuresofts Enterprise Configuration Manager ECM and Ecoras IT Auditor for Windows will document your networks computers but they work in sharply different ways ECM gathers a nearly overwhelming wealth of detail from the Windows NT and machines either servers or clients on which you install Configuresoft Distributed Component Object Model agents IT Auditor needs no agents but it gathers information only from servers ECM reports a ream of data on every computer much of which youll never examine or need While even the short version of IT Auditors reports are verbose they contain useful nuggets of server configuration data Our tests showed ECM is the better tool for monitoring and troubleshooting Windows machines but we wouldnt use it for collections of more than about clients When used strictly to help manage Windows servers or on small Windows based networks however ECM is an extremely useful tool IT Auditors serveronly reports are less useful and its data collection process is slower than molasses in January ECM supplies more detail about each agentequipped Windows and NT computer than youd ever need Unfortunately it doesnt offer configuration management for Windows Millennium Edition ECMs details include free disk space event log entries device drivers file and printer shares installed software running processes services user IDs passwords and even registry keys and values When we used the ECM data to troubleshoot client configuration problems drilling down through the mass of configuration data was easy only for a small to moderate number of clients For large client populations using the ECM data to solve a problem with a specific client node would be tedious and time consuming On the other hand on an ongoing basis monitoring client configuration changes with ECM to stay ahead of problems such as running out of local disk space is easy Similarly monitoring Windowsbased servers with ECM adds an incremental assurance that those servers will remain healthy and available Judiciously using ECM to manage only server configurations is a smart and creative application of ECMs abilities Ecoras IT Auditor for Windows will collect data on your Windows and NT servers It gathers data on running applications Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and DNS settings event log entries file and print shares hardware settings installed operating system particulars user IDs and groups server policies services file replication specifications TCPIP settings and domain controller details IT Auditor for Windows doesnt monitor clients which leaves the vast majority of your computers configurations unwatched However if youre only interested in servers or dead set against installing agents on client machines IT Auditor is your kind of tool IT Auditor for Windows emits a set of reports each time it collects server configuration settings The reports are the data repository it doesnt store configuration data in a relational database IT Auditor produces both short and longversion reports in Web page commaseparatedvalue and Word document formats Disappointingly the Word documents in our tests consisted of the same HTML as the Web page reports The Web page shortversion report wasnt all that short containing entries such as If it needs to Windows can move pieces of the operating system to the hard disk to free up memory to describe Windows and NT memory paging When youre in the midst of solving a problem such verbiage is less than helpful The long version contains paragraph after paragraph of Windows server tutorial material youll quickly find superfluous Importing the commaseparatedvalue files into Excel takes just a single mouse click IT Auditor also can produce Visio diagrams of the servers in your domains if you have Visio installed on the same machine as IT Auditor Like ECM IT Auditor can filter to display just those server parameter values that have changed since the last time IT Auditor was run For the full report go to reviewsrevhtml To contact Neal Weinberg Neal Weinberg is features editor at Network World in

points Part Dear Wincenty Kaminski In this issue Consistency is key for a access points from Proxim and Intel Links related to Network World product reviews Featured reader resource Only the best products debut at DEMO February Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort Phoenix Arizona DEMO introduces the products forecast to shape the marketplace and market trends in the coming year Top analysts developers executives venture backers and journalists gather to experience the best products and connect with technologys elite at this handson event Visit demobrochurenwpdf or demonw to register Todays focus a access points Part By Neal Weinberg The Reviewmeister couldnt wait to test the new a wireless access points These babies run at a screaming M bitsec compared to only M bitsec for b products We tested four products from three companies Proxims Harmony targeted at the enterprise Proxims Skyline Access Point Intels ProWireless and SMCs W access point All are based on the same wireless chipsetreference model from Atheros but unlike cookiecutter b products their flexibility management and performance varied In our tests two of the three vendors Proxim and Intel submitted products that performed consistently The speed demon over the widest broadcast range in the bunch SMC had very fast performance and occasionally highly erratic behavior until we downloaded another Version of its firmware Compatibility between different access points and the CardBus adapters supplied was very good In a mode all the adapters could connect to every access point even with Wired Equivalent Privacy WEP encryption enabled In ad hoc mode connecting two PCs without an access point all the adapters worked well together with the other access points with some cards having better speed But when we used turbo mode a multichannel nonstandard mode between an access point and a competing adapter we couldnt achieve a connection between that card and the access point For now turbo mode shoots compatibility dead between different products resulting in disappointing performance Proxim Proxim clocked in the fastest rates both in compatibility mode and with its own access point Running against the Intel access point the Proxim card turned in a M bitsec score Proxim also turned in the best score with its own access point with M bitsec Proxims Harmony product line uses a central wireless hub management appliance to control the Harmony access points The management appliance then controls the Proxim access points a or b on a subnet We found the Webbased access point controller application to be incredibly thorough and easy to use with multiple Harmony access point deployments If the Harmony access points are located on the same subnet an access point controller can be set to apply rules to any newly joining Harmony access point Indeed we found that when the controller goes offline the access points stopped within a few seconds theyre slaves to the controller Proxim also produces an access point in its Skyline product line and its characteristics were virtually identical to Harmonys in performance The main difference between Skyline and Harmony is that the Skyline access points cant be managed by the access point controller The Harmony line also includes a proprietary encryption algorithm thats different from WEP but Proxim refused to say how its different This encryption method is in addition to the bit through bit WEP encryption methods available and common to all the access points we tested Another Harmony feature is a forced VPN tunneling method that can also force logons to a single server This adds a great deal of security to mobile networks and could potentially reduce driveby logon risks dramatically Additional security imposed at the server that is the target of the tunnel requires the drivebys to get past whatever security is imposed at the server as well The Harmony access point controller also supports Remote Authentication DialIn User Service RADIUS for added authentication media access control MAC layer address admittance control and SNMP for monitoring Multicasts can also be filtered This helps improve performance on wireless segments While the Harmony line was easiest to set up from a multiple access point perspective its X performance was disappointing except in ad hoc mode Proxims X mode is designed to operate at a theoretical rate of M bitsec approaching the speed of Fast Ethernet In our testing we didnt come close Worse we saw a severe dropoff in range in X mode to the point where we had difficulty completing tests in the foot range We were disappointed as we wanted a good excuse not to wire BaseTX Intel Compared with Proxims access point Intels ProWireless has no frills The ProWireless is managed through a Web interface Unlike Proxim and SMC Intel doesnt have a turbo mode The ProWireless uses a fairly utilitarian setup with an express setup that will be sufficient for most installations The ProWireless also lacks encryption beyond WEP standard encryption This means that the maximum encryption available is bit While MAC admittance control is available theres no provision for RADIUS authentication or any other authentication capability Like the other access points tested the ProWireless can be configured as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server The Intel access point has fixed antennae An option is available to limit the antenna pattern to half circle front from an omnidirectional pattern but we found only a nominal boost in performance when we chose this option Like the other access points tested the Intel unit allows a wide choice of channels to be chosen No provision is made for traffic or protocol filtering While slow on performance it was consistent across the ranges We tested the ProWireless less than the others because it had no errors and no additional modes to test Sometimes boring has its place in connectivity Intels product was consistent and satisfying in its consistency For the full report go to reviewsrevhtml To contact Neal Weinberg Neal Weinberg is features editor at Network World in charge of product reviews Buyers

Visit demobrochurenwpdf or demonw to register Todays focus IP videoconferencing services Part By Neal Weinberg The Reviewmeister is interested in videoconferencing but Id rather go with a service provider than deal with the hassle of setting up a fullblown videoconferencing network So we tested six IP videoconferencing service providers Four were Internet based and did not offer quality of service the other two used private networks rather than the public Internet and offered guaranteed QoS In this newsletter well focus on the Internetbased services next time well talk about the guaranteed QoS type services The four Internetbased services we looked at were Reality Fusions SeeSaw FVCs CUseeMe World Eyeball Networks Communicator and FocusFocus Conference Reality Fusions SeeSaw came out on top in our testing It met our expectations in terms of features and had goodquality video and audio We also found that Reality Fusions service management portal gives network executives significant control over enterprise network traffic and the use of resources All of the Internetbased services charge on a payasyougo nocontract basis except for FVCs CUseeMe World which is free So if youre dissatisfied with these services you can easily go elsewhere With Internetbased services the provisioning issues are borne entirely by the customer Each end user must obtain the client application and perform routine installations We installed client applications on multiple operating systems and found that with one exception FocusFocus client doesnt support Windows XP the vendors are prepared to support the range of desktop environments found in enterprise networks We also were pleasantly surprised at how well each application FocusFocus was the exception again used builtin Windows drivers to discover and configure the camera speakers and microphone to maximize video quality and minimize echo The Eyeball Communicator client application is only M bytes in size while the CUseeMe Pro and SeeSaw clients are about the same footprint in the M to Mbyte range The FocusFocus client application came in at a lean K bytes During pointtopoint and multipoint calls we found that quality varied Regardless of the bandwidth available at the last mile the sessions began with an active chat session during which we needed to adjust audio or reposition our Web camera to produce the best effects Some notes on each system We did not like the graphic design of the FocusFocus client application because it was too crowded and lacked graphic treatments CUseeMe Pro was more like a light application in contrast with previous software clients published by the company Eyeballs client was intuitive to use and elegant in the way that multiple windows could be detached from the communications application interface and then reattached SeeSaws user interface is a stylish black navigation window with controls on the right and status indicators and a meeting participant list on the left of the screen We liked the use of icons to show the moderator and speaker roles as well as the audio and video quality produced by the codec in the application With the exception of FocusFocus which did not offer a satisfactory multipoint usage scenario the remaining service providers could support meetings of four to five users comfortably and could support larger meetings as needed In the case of SeeSaw Reality Fusion says it can support up to participants in a single meeting although only six can be seen on the screen at the same time For the full report go to

performance of five networkbased intrusion detection systems products from Cisco Computer Associates Enterasys Networks Intrusioncom and Internet Security Systems This time well look at how these products tested for management and other features Managing a large network of sensors is typically achieved through a threetiered architecture a central management console sensors and an event collector that offloads processing from the management console but reports back to it Under this arrangement one event collector manages up to sensors for example but each management console supports multiple event collectors All the vendors except CA have embraced this model CA doesnt use the event collector just the sensor and management console Cisco and Internet Security Systems ISS tied for top honors in this category Ciscos Secure Policy Manager which runs on Windows NT supports the best event management along with a highly intuitive logically designed interface that was a breeze to use Items were colorcoded and easily sorted and we could configure which fields we wanted displayed easily viewing more or less detail as we specified The ISS RealSecure Manager which resides on Windows NT or Solaris platforms is on par with Ciscos Secure Policy Manager supporting excellent event management good reporting and the best integration of applications CA Enterasys and Intrusioncom were a step below but were still good in this category CAs eTrust Intrusion Detection Management which runs on Windows NT and Millennium Edition platforms delivered the best statistics reporting of all five products tested Its reports were comprehensive and complete But eTrust was limited by the fact that it used several different applications that should have been integrated While Enterasys Webbrowser based Dragon Policy Manager had good reports and statistics its event management wasnt as robust as the other products Intrusioncoms RealSecure appliance was the easiest to install Within minutes we were up and running with minimal tweaks The Cisco Secure IDS an appliance also was easy to install but because the product supports so many advanced settings and configurations it was easy to get lost trying to find things Finally all of the products supported a full complement of IDS features Cisco Secure ID supported the largest database of known attack signatures while Intrusioncoms database was the smallest Enterasys supported the most granular attack database providing more details about attacks than the other products For the full report go to reviewsrevhtml To contact Neal Weinberg Neal

resource SO WHAT DO YOU THINK Give us your opinion on different banner advertisements and enter to win Take the Banner Concepts survey at bannerconceptindexcgi Todays focus Intrusion detection systems By Neal Weinberg Intrusion detection systems are key components to any security system So the Reviewmeister decided to check out networkbased IDS products from Cisco Computer Associates Enterasys Networks Intrusioncom and Internet Security Systems ISS The intrusion detection systems IDS products from Cisco Enterasys and Intrusioncom are appliances while CA and ISS offer softwarebased systems We conducted several tests to measure performance First we measured how well the product could detect a random sample of commonly recognized intrusion attacks such as ping floods Jolt attacks SYN floods finger bombs and others These were tested initially under no background traffic load To achieve a passing score the IDS had to correctly identify the attack within five minutes of the attacks launch We tallied whether the intrusion was recorded if it was correctly identified and the approximate time it took to recognize the attack Next we ran stress tests to see how the products would work as background traffic load increased from M to M bitsec then up to M bitsec A third test determined whether the products could detect attacks specifically designed to avoid traditional IDS systems Enterasys IDS Dragon took the gold in performance In addition to its excellent showing in the first two tests Dragon also beat the competition by detecting attacks that are specifically designed to avoid traditional IDS systems IDS Dragon also performed with near bulletproof reliability demonstrating minimal performance degradation under traffic load and solid system stability during all of the tests The IDS Dragon missed only three out of random attacks and detected out of the resulting attacks sent to it under the M and M bitsec traffic load With the M bitsec traffic IDS Dragon correctly detected out of attacks No other product performed as well with the basic intrusion detection and stress tests although Cisco Secure IDS performed well under load The ISS RealSecure performed well under M and M bitsec loads detecting out of attacks but fell down to attacks out of when the traffic load went to M bitsec Intrusioncoms SecureNet Pro had the hardest time under heavy background traffic loads After a strong start detecting out of attacks with no load performance steadily declined as load increased It detected only four out of attacks under the M bitsec load Curiously SecureNet detected the highest number of attacks under no load but supported the smallest database of known attack signatures of the products tested All the products tested did well in detecting certain attacks including Whisker various types Targa and Bind which are specifically designed to evade networkbased IDS products Cisco CA Enterasys and Intrusioncom detected out of attacks and ISS got them all While CAs eTrust IDS performed adequately in our stress tests it did not perform consistently under high M bitsec loads It appeared that the longer we let the background traffic stream run up to minutes or more the less consistently eTrust detected the attacks For the full report go to reviewsrevhtml To contact Neal Weinberg Neal Weinberg is features editor at Network World in

Dear Wincenty Kaminski In this issue NetScouts nGenius admin toolset is comprehensive but slow and expensive Links related to Network World product reviews Featured reader resource More with Less Budgets are either stagnant or shrinking this year and net executives are being forced to do more with less money and often fewer people Weve compiled a series of Network World articles newsletters and columns you can use to make the most of your budget and resources goadhtml Todays focus NetScouts nGenius By Neal Weinberg The Reviewmeister is all for any tool that can automate repetitive network administrative tasks so we checked out nGenius by NetScout Systems The nGenius suite which NetScout obtained when it acquired NextPoint Networks last year contains Real Time Monitor Plus Application Service Level Manager and Capacity Planner To the NextPoint software NetScout added a number of enhancements and additions including its WebCast technology for rendering reports using a Webbased newspaper publishing metaphor We found nGenius network monitoring to be accurate and comprehensive the reports thoughtfully designed and the documentation especially clear and comprehensive However we found the Javabased nGenius software slow and cumbersome We would have liked a greater degree of integration among the nGenius components and we feel the price tag for the three tools makes the software far too expensive Real Time Monitor Plus impressed us with its accurate monitoring analyzing and reporting of network traffic In particular its troubleshooting features helped us isolate the causes of the network problems we gave it to handle Real Time Monitor Plus consists of nGenius Server Traffic Monitor Performance Monitor and Packet Analyzer The nGenius Server sorts stores and analyzes packets from NetScout probes routers and switches and it has a user interface for managing network devices and identifying people authorized to access nGenius Traffic Monitor displays realtime network activity at configurable intervals from seconds to minutes while Performance Monitor and Packet Analyzer examine network activity to pinpoint bandwidth bottlenecks and categorize the kinds of traffic causing network problems Application Service Level Manager ferrets out application traffic jams by studying an applications Open Database Connectivity packets TCP socket usage or HTML emissions Once we defined our test applications minimum service levels in these terms Application Service Level Manager alerted us to servicelevel exceptions by paging us sending email and transmitting SNMP traps We used Capacity Planner to discover our networks devices collect network utilization data from those devices and report the results It gave us useful browserbased reports showing historical data baseline data and trends in an easyto understand newspaperlike format We found customizing the various Capacity Planner reports via the NewsEditor module to be straightforward Similarly setting up threshold filters to define exceptions we wanted nGenius to monitor was an easy task The Java and database runtime environment NetScout ships with the nGenius suite which consists of JRun from Allaire now part of Macromedia and an Oracle database Version JRun is a Java Enterprise Edition JEE application server The nGenius suite runs on Windows NT Windows and Solaris and its threetier architecture makes it possible to distribute nGenius components across multiple computers Unfortunately even when spread across different computers the nGenius server Traffic Monitor and Capacity Planner components werent as responsive in our tests as we would have liked Installing the nGenius components takes several steps with server reboots required between steps The tedious installation is further complicated by the softwares exacting platform requirements Windows NT for instance must be version with Service Pack a have Internet Explorer with Java Virtual Machine and run on at least a dualprocessor MHz Intel computer with G byte of memory a by pixel color monitor set for colors and G bytes of disk storage NGenius excels at monitoring analyzing and reporting on network utilization in an enterprise setting Still well hold off on recommending nGenius until it gets a bit faster and carries a smaller price tag For the full report go to reviewsrevhtml To contact Neal

measures packet loss and roundtrip time VisualPulse is Web serverbased and operates on Linux and Windows platforms While VisualPulse supports Windows and Millennium Edition Visualware recommends deploying VisualPulse on a Windows server in an enterprise environment A feature of VisualPulse that we found particularly attractive was its minimal client requirements If you have a Javaenabled browser you can access all of the reporting and configuration options of VisualPulse VisualPulse requires Microsofts Java VM build or later and the use of Internet Explorer is recommended The VisualPulse home page is extremely well laid out All the functions needed to configure and operate VisualPulse are grouped into status report and tool headings The status group is the heart of VisualPulse containing links to a listing of all systems being monitored critical latency and packet loss reports and the system monitor The system monitor page provides a scrolling display of the response time and packet loss for each system VisualPulse is watching If less than five packets have been lost the host name is highlighted in yellow If more than five packets are lost it turns red Packet loss is indicated by a vertical red bar and latency by a vertical black bar This page was so well designed that we could glance at it and get an immediate sense of network health VisualPulse also provides a simpletouse email notification feature Plug in your mail server host name and the email address to which you want alerts sent and youre ready With the number of bad guys hacking away on the Internet network managers might be nervous about putting a list of critical systems and network performance statistics where everyone can see it Dont worry VisualPulse gives administrators a

NetScreens revamped Global Pro management suite Released in November Global Pro takes network executives out of the tedious position of managing individual firewalls and moves them into the realm of policybased security management Before now NetScreen had fallen behind competitors such as Check Point Avaya and Nokia because it didnt offer centralized policybased configuration Global Pro comes in two flavors The Express version which we evaluated can manage up to devices This version lacks some of the aggregate reporting tools available in the higher end full version which scales up to devices sports an Oracle database backend and offers some fault tolerance For the Global Pro Express you get quite a bit of management machinery for It comes standard on a dedicated Sun server with a MHz Sun Netra T processor with M bytes of RAM To install Global Pro Express hook up a terminal and give it an IP address The management server comes prebuilt with a firewall and can be placed anywhere inside your network Management is controlled from any Windows NT or Windows system The Management Server has a small Web server installed largely to feed Windows the Javabased management graphical user interface that communicates with the management server Security policies are key to Global Pro There are types of security policies ranging from the prosaic such as where to send SYSLOG messages to the critical such as what traffic gets in and what traffic does not Policies are defined using a simple interface and can then be applied to as many firewalls or firewall groups as youd like We defined a policy listing all our corporate mail servers and stating that the Internet could connect to our corporate mail servers but only for the purpose of sending us mail The beautiful thing about NetScreens policybased management is that if a new firewall is added into one of the groups already attached to the policy Global Pro automatically builds a policy for it that includes all the policies for that group The same is true of changes to the policy If a new mail server is added all it takes is a push to all firewalls to make them aware of the change in policy Features like realtime monitoring and alerting are built into the product as is a powerful set of delegated management functions With the ability to partition the management function across multiple servers NetScreens architecture looks as if it can scale to thousands of firewalls Global Pro could go a lot further in showing the big picture of your network however Global Pro has a summary report that gives you a partial view of the enterprise firewall configuration but the report was not as complete as we wanted NetScreen still has some work to do on Global Pro Still its an outstanding first effort and NetScreen clearly has strong insight into the way network executives want to handle policy based security management For the full report go to reviewsrevhtml To contact Neal Weinberg Neal

CN Last time we looked at the Cisco and Colubris products This time we check out Coms and Avayas wares Coms Access Point is a welldesigned product It features a twoposition wireless access point with a flip antenna as well as a retractable XJack antenna on its wireless network interface card NIC The XJack lets you store the antenna in the NIC when not in use keeping it in your laptop during transportation Coms Dynamic Security Link technology is similar to Ciscos Lightweight Extensive Authentication Protocol LEAP One benefit of Dynamic Security Link is that it increases the number of simultaneous users from to Furthermore you dont have to manually enter the bit keys The software automatically generates new keys and distributes them to the client each session This is great for encryption but you still need to provide for authentication It took only seconds to set up the access point but implementing the full range of security took a while longer Coms browserbased Configuration Management System was excellent and the HTMLbased documentation was complete and well organized In all Coms product had some neat technology Avayas wireless NIC looked familiar and thats because it was It seems that both Colubris and Avaya use NICs from Orinoco But Avayas solution goes far beyond just the NIC Avayas Access Server is a slick tool for managing corporate level wireless security It includes Remote Authentication Dial In User Server software that runs on any workstation plugged into the hardwired LAN And it employs automatic key generation and distribution Avayas

By Neal Weinberg You may have heard reports that Wired Equivalent Privacy the protocol designed for wireless security is flawed The Reviewmeister heard the same reports so we decided to test out a bunch of wireless LAN security products that go beyond WEP We tested the following products for their security manageability and suitability for enterprise use Coms Access Point Avayas Access Server Ciscos Aironet access point and Access Control Server ACS and Colubris CN Our favorite product was the Cisco Aironet and ACS Ciscos access point is a sleek darkgray box with two flip antennas Instead of a power jack Cisco uses a power injector that sits between your LAN jack and the access point You will probably want to configure the unit via a browser but a serial port is available as well Installing the wireless LAN adapter was quick and easy When it came to configuring the card Ciscos voluminous documentation was a little troubling The wireless access point and the wireless network interface card each have three guides for a total of pages worth of documentation You can set the system for three different levels of security Extensive Authentication Protocol EAP Lightweight EAP LEAP and none EAP was developed to support multiple authentication mechanisms Instead of selecting a specific mechanism it waits until the authentication phase This allows the authenticator to request more information before determining the specific mechanism EAP is a complex standard thats not widely used LEAP is Ciscos proprietary implementation of EAP that ensures mutual authentication using private and public keys If you want maximum security you can set up the access point to accept LEAPonly but you also can set it up to use both LEAP and bit state WEP connections Both LEAP and EAP require a Remote Authentication Dial In User Server RADIUS for centralized management of users In our tests we found that we could crack the bit static WEP in less than hours but when we switched to a LEAP enabled RADIUS server our network security was still intact hours later Colubris offers innovation Canadian company Colubris uses embedded VPN technology to enhance b security Colubris largely succeeds with its CN Wireless LAN Router Instead of using a different set of electronics for its access point the top of the CN is a PC card slot into which you slide one of its wireless network interface cards The CN includes a builtin network address translation firewall and the ability to act as a gateway for a hardwired subnet However support for security is the most important feature The product supports VPN passthrough but the CN is a VPN server Access control lists can be managed directly on the access point which provides good flexibility for most corporate networks The CN comes with a realtime link status a site survey tool and a monitoring tool that helps system administrators plan for the best layout and coverage of wireless LANs The Webbased management tool gets a Secure Sockets Layer SSL enabled link allowing remote administrators to securely manage its VPN capabilities through any SSL browser For the full report go to reviewsrevhtml To contact Neal Weinberg Neal

Network design tools Part Dear Wincenty Kaminski In this issue A closer look at the Visionael Microsoft and Didyma net design tools Links related to Network World product reviews Featured reader resource THE STORAGE OPTIONS Ever since September th spending on storage has increased How are you ensuring that youre choosing the right network storage options Network Worlds Deni Connor evaluates the networked storage options Before you start spending next years budget check out what Connor has to say at goadhtml Todays focus Network design tools Part By Neal Weinberg As we said last time nobodys perfect and neither were the various network design tools we tested We tested Visionaels Visionael Compuwares EcoPredictor Microsofts Visio Professional with Enterprise Network Tools NetRule from Analytical Engines and Bert Houtriets shareware Didyma In the last newsletter we looked at EcoPredictor and NetRule This time we turn our attention to the rest none of which met our criteria for a fullfeatured network design tool Visionael is a superior tool for discovering designing and documenting a network but it didnt let us simulate application or network activity Didyma can discover design and document a network but it cant simulate the effect of the changes you make Microsofts Visio is an excellent network design diagramming tool that with the Enterprise Network Tools option can discover and document a network but it cant simulate application activity within the network Visionael was the most complex and comprehensive of the products we tested In the lab its discovery feature used SNMPbased software probes to gather network layout and device identification data Optional Microsoft System Management Server and HewlettPackards OpenView software probes can collect data from those respective products Because Visionael is as much a network and system inventory tool as a design tool the discovery process collects far more computer and network device detail such as basic IO system versions and adapter slot usage than a network planner needs During design sessions the diagramming tool collects this same level of detail about proposed network components Even while youre designing network changes in Visionael it continues to monitor the existing network to ensure its baseline data is accurate In our tests Visionael stored network component data relationally in an Oracle i database Visionael also offers versions of its product that work with Sybase Adaptive Server or Microsoft SQL Server Visios Enterprise Network Tools option collects the same information regardless of whether a network node is a router or a computer Visio stores its diagramming specifications and network device details in a proprietary binary format In addition to rendering the network drawing in hard copy or Web page form Visio can produce Web pages Visio table shape or XMLbased asset reports containing asset types asset owners names and manufacturers Visio can also export data to Microsoft Excel Microsoft Access or a relational database via Open Database Connectivity While it doesnt have a simulation feature for modeling the behavior of a proposed network design Didyma has a monitoring function that can periodically ping existing network devices to detect their health Its discovery feature updates the current design workspace with only the identities of the devices it finds which makes for even more data entry effort during the design sessions that follow a discovery operation Furthermore as it collects data during a design session Didyma doesnt distinguish among the various types of network nodes Whether a node is a computer router or other device Didyma like Visio asks for the same information This consists of name IP address SNMP community string interface type Ethernet token ring or serial media access control address DNS name whether to monitor the node and whether to include it in reports For the full report go to reviewsbgtochtml To
