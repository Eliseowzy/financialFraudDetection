Wednesday November AM To Gossett Jeffrey C Keiser Kam Jones Brad ORourke Ryan Pehlivanova Biliana Subject FW DYNshENEsh Merger At Risk Simmons and Company latest thoughts got this from a friend at dynegy written by someone at Simmons Co Inc To Sales Trading cc AM Subject DYNshENE sh Merger At Risk SUMMARY We are reducing our estimated probability that the DYNENE merger is completed to less than based on our belief that ENEs existing wholesale and retail businesses are having a difficult time maintaining their volumes and margins We have discussed ENEs need to improve counter party confidence on a number of occasions over the last few weeks and we believe counter party confidence deteriorated further based on the information included in the Q and the strong negative reaction in the stock and bond markets yesterday The tone of our discussions with competing traders and marketers representative of ENEs counter partieswhich are critical in maintaining ENEs volumes is becoming more negative While ENE is continuing to confirm that volumes are improving since the lows on November our market intelligence is suggesting improment has stalled In addition and probably related ENEs liquidity position seems to be continuing to deteriorate despite significant recent capital infusions We are reducing Q estimates to reflect lower volume and margin assumptions What would get us more comfortable ENE K disclosure confirming higher volume and decent margins ENE has committed to provide Q guidance by earlymid December andor a change in the tone of the counter parties that would suggest they are increasing trading activities with ENE OPINION ON THE STOCKS ENE No change in our opinion on ENEthe upside potential is simply not worth the downside risk DYN DYN is likely to benefit in almost all outcomes If our concerns about counter party confidence prove to be wrong the upside associated with the accretion in the transaction would likely be huge However we sense DYN is getting frustrated by continued restatement of earnings unexpected debt triggers and worse than expected liquidity problems If the transaction falls apart DYN would have some transaction costs that would negatively impact cash flow in the nearterm but DYN would benefit from gaining market share and hiring some of ENEs talent away longer term A potential downside case for DYN is that DYN retrades the deal on recent information but is forced to reduced its flexibility to terminate the transaction through material adverse change considerations this out come would concern us We continue to believe DYN is a solid longterm holding for investors However we are recommending caution with new money due to our belief that DYN still has sh to sh of deal premium factored into the current stock price which could be at risk if the deal fails We do not believe DYN has significant accounts receivable exposure to ENE in the event the ENE has further liquidity problems we believe DYNs trading agreement with ENE limits exposure to maybe to MM COUNTER PARTY INCENTIVES ENE identified in its Q that transaction volume especially longterm transactions have declined since the Q If you are a utility or industrial customer why enter into a longterm transaction with ENE Why not go directly to DYN or diversify with other suppliers If you are a natural gas or power producer why create the account receivable risk If you are a counter party strategically why would you contribute to the continuation of the ENE machineto the ultimate benefit of strengthening another competitor DYN We believe that ENE is offering attractive financial incentives premium purchases andor discounted sales to entice counter parties to trade with them However this would also suggest ENE margins may be getting squeezed EPS ESTIMATES newoldconsensus Q FY FY We are reducing expectations for margins in the Wholesale segment from ctsmmbtu to ctsmmbtunegatively impacting Q EPS by ctssh In addition we expect contributions from Enron Energy Services will be lower due to challenges in closing longterm transactions much of EESs earnings are marktomarket recognition of the value created in longterm agreeements impacting our estimate by ctssh This email is based on information obtained from sources which Simmons Company International believes to be reliable but Simmons Company International does
