last week Given the level of respect that the Commissioner has for Mr Gilder MKP has repeatedly referenced Gilders book Telecosm and speaks of him frequently it may be worth reading In any event it gives a pretty good foot view of telecom policy considerations Original Message From Paul Jackson mailto Sent Friday February PM To Subject powellinterns Gilder Letter to Chairman Powell Confidential The Wall Street Journal Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Friday February The Broadband Economy Needs a Hero By George Gilder and Bret Swanson Dear Mr Powell Whether you know it or not your leadership and decisions over the next four years will have more impact on the economy than those of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan Surely our stockmarket swoon of and stagnating economic growth in are partly due to the Feds inexplicable liquidity leash combined with the highest tax burden since World War II But the chief threats to the st century economy are the politicians bureaucrats and Silicon Valley knownothings responsible for Americas broadband connectivity crisis We owe Les Vadasz of Intel an apology for making fun of his prediction that narrowband links would prevail into the st century The Internet as we know it is about seven years old yet fewer than million of million American homes enjoy broadband and its wealth of social commercial and educational opportunities Contrary to popular belief the chief obstacle to progress is not entrenched Bell operating companies but a regulatory regime that presumes to level the playing field equalize access and promote competition The only result of these policies has been the effective nationalization and paralysis of broadband The Telecommunications Act ruled that in exchange for the right to enter the longdistance telephone business the Bells must open their residential copper lines to competitors as well as allow these competitors to locate equipment in Bell central offices and offer digital subscriber line DSL services over Bellowned copper In November the FCC issued a further decree forcing the Bells to stop dragging their feet and cooperate The FCC actions spawned a new category of startups known as broadband competitive local exchange carriers CLECs which planned to compete with the Bells Funded by billions of dollars in Silicon Valley venture capital and public offerings companies like Rhythms Northpoint Covad and Jato earned praise from libertarians in both Washington and Palo Alto Calif Northpoint even had freedomloving former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt on its board But despite all good intentions these were not hightech startups They became venture capitalfunded lobbying and litigation shops intent on forcing the Bells to share their copper With more press releases on new lawsuits than on new subscribers one of the companies epitomized the strategy Rhythms continues successful regulatory litigation The result of all this lawyering The CLECs won everything Access to copper wherever they sued Multimillion dollar awards from the Bells And bankruptcy Bankruptcy Late last year Northpoint filed for Chapter after Verizon withdrew an million investment Jato closed its doors Rhythms cut its staff by Covad is slashing jobs and closing central offices Of Covads lines in service are not recognizing revenue And all of this is happening in the face of massive consumer demand for broadband services The problem is that DSL is risky and hard Some studies have reported that of DSL hookups fail on the first try Even amicable relationships between CLECs and Bells are a software nightmare with a different billing and provisioning system for each service provider Such difficulties render DSL not a matter of will and politics but of technical and entrepreneurial risks Companies are forced to invest heavily in research and engineering personnel but have few opportunities for outsized rewards Thats because Congress and the FCC set up an awkward scheme in which everyone got a piece of the action but no one could make any money Often barred from carrying signals across longdistance boundaries the Bells hand off traffic to other longdistance carriers CLECs rent lines from the Bells And Internet service providers end up doing costly customer service and marketing to get people signed up in the first place In short as many as four parties routinely battle for low or negativemargin chunks of monthly bills By summoning new competition and then mandating the rivals cooperate in open access the government effectively privatized the risks and socialized the profits By December the Bells had signed up million users and the CLECs combining for just million DSL subscribers among the million or so copperconnected US homes and businesses Cable modems with million subscribers at yearend have done better but AOL Time Warner and ATT Americas two cable behemoths are bogged down by the same openaccess nonsense that plagues DSL Over the past two years ATT CEO Michael Armstrong acquired billion in cable assets while watching his companys billion market capitalization plummet to billion Just last month the Federal Trade Commission ruled that AOL Time Warner must offer at least one nonaffiliated cable broadband ISP Internet Service Provider service on Time Warners cable system before AOL itself begins offering service followed by two other nonaffiliated ISPs within days and a requirement to negotiate in good faith with others after that The nations secondlargest ISP EarthLink will now get access to AOLs expensive cables pretty much for free This regulatory morass treats the most dynamic technically creative and transformative industry in the world economy as if it were some static commodity market for corn or pork bellies Mr Chairman in a recent speech you made the key point that innovation is more important than price competition When it comes to leadingedge services and technologies narrow price competition is almost meaningless Internet innovation means qualitative change orderofmagnitude price reductions and constantly changing services that always constitute monopolies when first launched No Internet advantage can last more than a couple of years In and over million kilometers of optical fiber were laid worldwide enough to stretch to the sun Hundreds of billions of dollars have already been invested by metropolitan fiberoptic network builders Metromedia Fiber Level Communications optical hardware companies Avanex ONI Sorrento and optical service providers Yipes Cogent Sphera These companies are already rendering the metropolitan DSL debate moot with thousandfold increases in price performance over existing technology Similar breakthroughs are on the way in residential wireless But none of these deployments including fiber to the home can flourish under a regime of forced sharing of entrepreneurial assets and profits In this environment let the Bells compete in longdistance and extort any temporary profits they can from their local copper cages Let the cable companies capitalize on their advantage for the few years it will last Allow the infinite spectrum of air and fiber to be exploited in any way its owners wish Then sit back and nostalgically recall those early days of the Internet when we naively thought a economic growth rate was really something The broadband economy needs a hero

company interests predict the Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act HR will clear the House Energy and Commerce Committee by a comfortable margin tomorrow Opponents however hope that enough amendments and opposition will surface to dampen Congresss enthusiasm for broadband relief legislation It looks like it will pass US Telecom Association interim President and Chief Executive Officer Gary S Lytle told TR today after a press briefing to review the legislation It should get somewhere in the mid to high s he said referring to the number of members on the person panel that USTA predicts will vote for the bill at tomorrows markup session The bill cleared the telecommunications and the Internet subcommittee last month by a vote TR April Meanwhile a substitute version of HR that began circulating late last night Monday has sparked another round of bickering between Bell company interests and members of the competitive local exchange carrier and interexchange carrier industries The substitute released by Commerce Committee Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin R La incorporates the four amendments that were approved by the telecom subcommittee It also adds new language regarding FCC rules on ILECs resale of advanced services and line sharing and new definitions for Internet backbone services and Internet access service H Russell Frisby Jr president of the Competitive Telecommunications Association said the new provisions would make the legislation go from bad to worse under the guise of compromise The new definition of Internet backbone services is too broad he said as it would include too many services in a deregulated regime Mr Frisby also pointed to language that purportedly would preserve CLECs ability to implement line sharing The FCCs linesharing rules permit CLECs to offer data services over the highfrequency portion of a line while the ILEC continues to provide voice services over the lowerfrequency portion But Mr Frisby said the substitute bill would invalidate later FCC orders that put the meat on the bones of the linesharing mandates According to a copy of the substitute draft the FCCs rules on line sharing would remain intact but ILECs wouldnt be required to provide access to the highfrequency portion of the loop at the remote terminal a provision that another critic agrees would undercut the Commissions linesharing rules If line sharing is not allowed through remote terminals then of consumers will be denied residential broadband competition because of this bill the CLEC source said That claim however was disputed by Thomas J Tauke senior vice presidentpublic policy and external affairs for Verizon Communications Inc Speaking with reporters at the USTA press briefing Mr Tauke said the bills new linesharing language would have a minimal effect on CLECs in Verizons service territory because very few of them use line sharing For Verizon the substitute language would eliminate the economic and practical problems of providing for line sharing when we have fiber in the local loop he said Rep Tauzins substitute bill also has new language requiring ILECs to continue reselling advanced services at wholesale rates for as many as three years after enactment of the bill The original version of the bill would have given ILECs an immediate exemption from resale obligations Committee staffers were said to be working out lastminute details on another amendment thats expected to be offered tomorrow by Reps Cliff Stearns R Fla Bobby L Rush D Ill and Thomas C Sawyer D Ohio According to sources the amendment would give ILECs immediate regulatory relief But it would require ILECs to make about of their central offices DSL digital subscriber lineready by a date certain most likely within three years of enactment Mr Tauke said Verizon would oppose any DSL buildout requirements saying its good public policy not to have a buildout provision in this legislation The government should mandate buildout requirements only when the market isnt working he said Many of the same amendments that were withdrawn during the telecom subcommittees review are being teed up for tomorrow including several from Rep Tom Davis III R Va and one from Rep Anna Eshoo D Calif to require Bell companies to continue filing servicequality and accounting reports at the FCC Rep Tauzin has said he would address FCC enforcement issues at tomorrows markup session but he may not tackle those issues through legislation Asked by TR whether Rep Tauzin planned to offer an FCC enforcement amendment to HR spokesman Ken Johnson said today I can only confirm that Reps Tauzin and Rep Fred Upton R Mich will offer an amendment before the bill gets to the House floor to substantially beef up the FCCs enforcement tools JUDGE CLECs DONT HAVE TO GIVE ILECs ACCESS TO RIGHTSOFWAY A federal district judge in Lincoln Neb has ruled that competitive local exchange carriers CLECs arent required to give incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs access to their poles ducts and rightsofway Judge Richard G Kopf made the determination in ATT Communications of the Midwest Inc v U S WEST Communications Inc et al case no CV ATT brought the lawsuit in seeking to overturn the Nebraska Public Service Commissions approval of an interconnection agreement That agreement required ATT to give U S WEST now Qwest Corp reciprocal access to poles ducts and rightsofway Consideration of the lawsuit was delayed by judicial challenges to the FCCs landmark order on carrier interconnection Judge Kopf was faced with a split among federal courts on how to handle an apparent contradiction in the Communications Act of as amended by the Telecommunications Act of Section of the Act appears to require all local exchange carriers LECs whether ILECs or CLECs to grant access to their rightsofway the judge said But section seems to require that all LECs grant access only to competitive not incumbent local exchange carriers he said The FCC had based its regulations on section and most federal district courts had deferred to that interpretation Judge Kopf said But the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit San Francisco has said it doubts the soundness of the FCCs interpretation of section Judge Kopf however followed the other district courts and deferred to the FCCs interpretation He concluded that in light of the Acts purpose which is to promote competition the FCCs interpretation that no ILEC may seek access to the facilities or rightsofway of a LEC or any utility under either section of section is based on a permissible construction of the statutes and does not conflict with the plain meaning of the Act Judge Kopf ruled that the reciprocalaccess portion of the companies interconnection agreement violated the Act and the FCCs rules He enjoined Qwest from enforcing that portion of the agreement FCC PROPOSES CHANGING USF CONTRIBUTION SYSTEM The FCC has proposed streamlining and simplifying the way it collects Universal Service Fund USF contributions The proposals which include limiting how carriers recover contributions from their customers and using a flatrate assessment are aimed at dealing with recent changes and developing trends in the industry The FCC recently tweaked the USF contribution system to reduce the lag time between accrual of revenues and payment of contributions based on those revenues TR March At that time it said it soon would consider more fundamental modifica tions to the USF contribution mechanism The USF supports affordable service in highcost areas and discounted service for lowincome customers schools libraries and rural health care providers USF contributions currently are assessed as a percentage of carriers interstate and international enduser telecom service revenues The percentage is based on revenues as of six months before the contributions are collected The FCC allows carriers to decide for themselves whether and how to recover contribution costs from their customers In a statement today the FCC said the following industry trends affect USF contributions the entrance of new companies such as the Bells into certain long distance markets growth in the wireless telecom sector to the extent that wireless carriers interstate revenues may exceed the FCCs interim safe harbor threshold for contributions and increased bundling of services making it difficult to distinguish interstate from intrastate revenues The FCC is seeking comments on whether it should require carriers to contribute a percentage of their collected revenues rather than a percentage of their billed revenues to the USF It wants to know whether it should assess contributions based on current or projected revenues The Commission also asks whether it should use a flat assessment such as a fixed perline charge if it should require that carriers give customers a uniform description of contribution recovery charges and whether those charges should be limited to the amount of the contribution assessment FCCs WIRELESS BUREAU SIDES WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES ON E COSTS The FCCs Wireless Telecommunications Bureau has sided with public safety agencies in a dispute over who should bear more of the financial burden for installing Phase I enhanced E systems In a May letter to the King County Wash E Program bureau Chief Thomas J Sugrue clarified that the selective router maintained by incumbent local exchange carriers is the proper demarcation point for allocating E implementation costs between wireless carriers and public safety answering points PSAPs The bureaus determination supports the view held by PSAPs Carriers on the other hand had maintained that PSAPs should be responsible for E network components or upgrades beginning at carriers switches The bureau sought comments on the issue last year in response to King Countys request for a clarification of the FCCs position TR Aug and Sept In the letter Mr Sugrue stressed that the agency continues to favor negotiation between the parties as the most efficacious and efficient means for resolving disputes regarding cost allocations for implementing Phase I But PSAPs still will have to bear some costs he said including upgrades to the selective router trunking equipment and other hardware and software STUDY SAYS MOBILE PHONE USE PLAYS LITTLE ROLE IN ACCIDENTS Mobile phones are responsible for distracting drivers in only a small percentage of vehicle accidents according to an analysis of accident data released today The University of North Carolinas Highway Safety Research Center compiled the study for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety using data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations Crashworthiness Data System The data were collected from to on vehicles involved in crashes in which at least one vehicle was towed from the scene Results were weighted to calculate national estimates In crashes where driver distraction was a factor of the time that distraction was something outside the drivers vehicle the study found Drivers attempts to adjust car radios was a factor in of collisions involving driver distraction and passengers were a factor in of those crashes the study said Mobile phones were number eight on the list of driver distractions Use of wireless phones preceded of crashes where driver distraction was a factor the study said The margin of error for each category varied from to for mobile phone use it was Jane Stutts manager of epidemiological studies at the UNC center and the studys author told TR that the mobile phone results were surprising just because people assume that cell phones cause a lot of crashes But she stressed that many drivers may be reluctant to tell police that they were distracted by using a phone They may try to hide it she said The estimates for mobile phone use were based on only reported cases Ms Stutts also noted that the driver distraction was listed as unknown for almost of the cases studied She said this fact highlights the need for improved collection of accident data CABLEVISION WONT HELP ATT SELL B CABLEVISION STAKE Cablevision Systems Corp executives today said they dont intend to help ATT Corp sell billion in Cablevision shares ATT had asked Cablevision a cable TV system operator based in Bethpage NY to register the million shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission allowing for a public sale TR April Cablevision has notified ATT that we will not proceed at this time with the registration of their shares of Cablevision common stock said William Bell Cablevisions vice chairman Instead Cablevision is considering its own public stock sale to raise funds to improve its cable TV networks he said during a conference call with investors and analysts Cablevisions decision may complicate ATTs efforts to sell the shares which it inherited in the takeover of Tele Communications Inc ATT wants to sell the stake to raise funds for debt reduction and to thin its cable TV holdings The FCCs rules regarding cable TV ownership are in limbo after being vacated by the US Court of Appeals in Washington But ATT has been maneuvering to sell some cable TV holdings in preparation for the enactment of new rules ATT still can sell the Cablevision shares Mr Bell said ATT has piggyback registration rights that entitle it under certain conditions to add its shares to Cablevisions public stock offerings according to SEC documents ATT may or may not be able to exercise some piggyback rights Mr Bell said It really will depend on market conditions and what Cablevisions needs are FCC SEEKS EXTRA M FOR ENGINEERING PROGRAM The FCC is asking congressional appropriators to earmark an additional million for its fiscal year budget The funds would help pay for a new Excellence in Engineering training and recruitment program President Bush has proposed million for the FCC for FY an increase over the Commissions current appropriation level TR April In a letter to Sen Conrad Burns R Mont FCC Chairman Michael K Powell says the extra money would be used for recruitment incentives educational initiatives for advanced and nonengineers at the FCC and upgrading the agencys technical equipment The overarching goal of the program is to ensure that the Commission maintains a high level of technical expertise so that it is at least as fluent in technology and engineering issues as are the entities it regulates Mr Powell said in the May letter Mr Powells letter included draft legislation that would allow the FCC to establish salaries for engineers and other technical and professional hires that are more competitive with the private sector The proposal also authorizes each Commissioner to hire a professional engineering assistant in addition to the three professional assistants they currently are allowed A Burns spokeswoman said the lawmaker was working with Mr Powell to submit the budget request Sen Burns is chairman of the

to him will be that I would welcome him stepping into a leadership role on these issues but that he needs to step up to the plate This means being able to do Hill meetings on his own being willing to step back and reevaluate our strategies from time to time and looking beyond Scott for policy and technical guidance Im also planning to make some general comments to the group as a whole at our EBS GA meeting in Colorado next week I think I need to talk about individual versus group efforts The issues circling in my mind at the moment are People need to realize that individual success does not happen independently of the success of our group as a whole This means that every person in our group needs to be able and willing to work constructively will every other individual in our group No exceptions Decisions about who attends meetings whether with the FCC Congressional members and staff or EBS executives will be determined according to the nature and purpose of the meeting That means that sometimes I step aside for you or Linda or Steve Kean and that sometimes one person in my group steps aside for another Individual success in not measured by the meetings that you attend Its measured by our effectiveness in achieving our agenda Anything else you can suggest that will help make clear to people that they are focusing on the wrong issues and that this will have a serious negative impact on their performance reviews I really would like to get beyond this point as quickly as possible Please let me know if you ever think Im wasting too much of your time with these petty issues Hows London Wayne and Zal have had a series of travel complications so Im the only one in Argentina so far I had a very good day of meetings with our lawyer yesterday Weve rescheduled meetings with the Argentine regulators for Wednesday afternoon so that Wayne and Zal will be able to make them This means only one day in Sao Paolo and one day in Brasilia but from all that Ive heard thats not

One view from DC Sue Nord Sr Director Government Affairs Forwarded by Sue NordNAEnron on PM Sue Nord PM To Stephen D NRON cc Subject Re EBS Government Affairs Regulatory Report for May Hi Steve The reason that Ive used DC Office is that Linda has indicated that she wants to distinguish between your assignments and Allisons assignments Im not sure if shes done this yet and I didnt want to presume anything If it works better to list your names individually I am happy to do that To be honest though I dont think Rick would be likely to interpret this to mean that your role is simply administrative Are you around at the end of the day today I have a meeting from but maybe we could talk afterward about the other issues you raise Thanks Sue Sue Nord Sr Director Government Affairs Stephen D Burns AM To Sue nron cc Subject EBS Government Affairs Regulatory Report for May Hi Sue This may be a function of the Washington officeEBS Government Affairs differing reporting relationships but With the DC office appearing only in supporting roles on reports like these Rick and Steve Kean are going to continue to have the impression that we exist to schedule meetings and execute plans formulated by others You know this is a sensitive point for me personally but beyond that it is important to my career development that I be seen as taking more of a lead I suppose Allison would feel the same way once she becomes more comfortable and familiar with the issues Therefore two requests Would you consider listing Allison and me as individuals not as DC Office Also and here I may be pushing it as you and I have discussed a couple of times am I taking the lead in the cable issue What about the BLM issue I always appear to Rick and Steve to be supporting Scott on these initiatives In my own twisted mind I think of myself as having more of a leadership role Sorry to continue to be ultra sensitive about this But frankly just between the two of us please since weve just brought on new Senior Directors in the past month knocking me a couple of rungs down the seniority ladder in one fell swoop I am trying to increase my visibility and maybe claim a little

to FCC Chairman Powell sets important parameters for our vision We anticipated that Powell would be unimpressed if not hostile to open access approaches but this should put a nail in the coffin The

Engel Michael C Sent Wednesday February PM To Telecommunications Practice Group Subject FW powellinterns Gilder Letter to Chairman Powell This is an interesting letter to Commissioner Powell published last week Given the level of respect that the Commissioner has for Mr Gilder MKP has repeatedly referenced Gilders book Telecosm and speaks of him frequently it may be worth reading In any event it gives a pretty good foot view of telecom policy considerations Original Message From Paul Jackson mailto Sent Friday February PM To Subject powellinterns Gilder Letter to Chairman Powell Confidential The Wall Street Journal Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Friday February The Broadband Economy Needs a Hero By George Gilder and Bret Swanson Dear Mr Powell Whether you know it or not your leadership and decisions over the next four years will have more impact on the economy than those of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan Surely our stockmarket swoon of and stagnating economic growth in are partly due to the Feds inexplicable liquidity leash combined with the highest tax burden since World War II But the chief threats to the st century economy are the politicians bureaucrats and Silicon Valley knownothings responsible for Americas broadband connectivity crisis We owe Les Vadasz of Intel an apology for making fun of his prediction that narrowband links would prevail into the st century The Internet as we know it is about seven years old yet fewer than million of million American homes enjoy broadband and its wealth of social commercial and educational opportunities Contrary to popular belief the chief obstacle to progress is not entrenched Bell operating companies but a regulatory regime that presumes to level the playing field equalize access and promote competition The only result of these policies has been the effective nationalization and paralysis of broadband The Telecommunications Act ruled that in exchange for the right to enter the longdistance telephone business the Bells must open their residential copper lines to competitors as well as allow these competitors to locate equipment in Bell central offices and offer digital subscriber line DSL services over Bellowned copper In November the FCC issued a further decree forcing the Bells to stop dragging their feet and cooperate The FCC actions spawned a new category of startups known as broadband competitive local exchange carriers CLECs which planned to compete with the Bells Funded by billions of dollars in Silicon Valley venture capital and public offerings companies like Rhythms Northpoint Covad and Jato earned praise from libertarians in both Washington and Palo Alto Calif Northpoint even had freedomloving former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt on its board But despite all good intentions these were not hightech startups They became venture capitalfunded lobbying and litigation shops intent on forcing the Bells to share their copper With more press releases on new lawsuits than on new subscribers one of the companies epitomized the strategy Rhythms continues successful regulatory litigation The result of all this lawyering The CLECs won everything Access to copper wherever they sued Multimillion dollar awards from the Bells And bankruptcy Bankruptcy Late last year Northpoint filed for Chapter after Verizon withdrew an million investment Jato closed its doors Rhythms cut its staff by Covad is slashing jobs and closing central offices Of Covads lines in service are not recognizing revenue And all of this is happening in the face of massive consumer demand for broadband services The problem is that DSL is risky and hard Some studies have reported that of DSL hookups fail on the first try Even amicable relationships between CLECs and Bells are a software nightmare with a different billing and provisioning system for each service provider Such difficulties render DSL not a matter of will and politics but of technical and entrepreneurial risks Companies are forced to invest heavily in research and engineering personnel but have few opportunities for outsized rewards Thats because Congress and the FCC set up an awkward scheme in which everyone got a piece of the action but no one could make any money Often barred from carrying signals across longdistance boundaries the Bells hand off traffic to other longdistance carriers CLECs rent lines from the Bells And Internet service providers end up doing costly customer service and marketing to get people signed up in the first place In short as many as four parties routinely battle for low or negativemargin chunks of monthly bills By summoning new competition and then mandating the rivals cooperate in open access the government effectively privatized the risks and socialized the profits By December the Bells had signed up million users and the CLECs combining for just million DSL subscribers among the million or so copperconnected US homes and businesses Cable modems with million subscribers at yearend have done better but AOL Time Warner and ATT Americas two cable behemoths are bogged down by the same openaccess nonsense that plagues DSL Over the past two years ATT CEO Michael Armstrong acquired billion in cable assets while watching his companys billion market capitalization plummet to billion Just last month the Federal Trade Commission ruled that AOL Time Warner must offer at least one nonaffiliated cable broadband ISP Internet Service Provider service on Time Warners cable system before AOL itself begins offering service followed by two other nonaffiliated ISPs within days and a requirement to negotiate in good faith with others after that The nations secondlargest ISP EarthLink will now get access to AOLs expensive cables pretty much for free This regulatory morass treats the most dynamic technically creative and transformative industry in the world economy as if it were some static commodity market for corn or pork bellies Mr Chairman in a recent speech you made the key point that innovation is more important than price competition When it comes to leadingedge services and technologies narrow price competition is almost meaningless Internet innovation means qualitative change orderofmagnitude price reductions and constantly changing services that always constitute monopolies when first launched No Internet advantage can last more than a couple of years In and over million kilometers of optical fiber were laid worldwide enough to stretch to the sun Hundreds of billions of dollars have already been invested by metropolitan fiberoptic network builders Metromedia Fiber Level Communications optical hardware companies Avanex ONI Sorrento and optical service providers Yipes Cogent Sphera These companies are already rendering the metropolitan DSL debate moot with thousandfold increases in price performance over existing technology Similar breakthroughs are on the way in residential wireless But none of these deployments including fiber to the home can flourish under a regime of forced sharing of entrepreneurial assets and profits In this environment let the Bells compete in longdistance and extort any temporary profits they can from their local copper cages Let the cable companies capitalize on their advantage for the few years it will last Allow the infinite spectrum of air and fiber to be exploited in any way its owners wish Then sit back and nostalgically recall those early days of the Internet when we naively thought a economic growth rate was really something The broadband economy needs a hero

company interests predict the Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act HR will clear the House Energy and Commerce Committee by a comfortable margin tomorrow Opponents however hope that enough amendments and opposition will surface to dampen Congresss enthusiasm for broadband relief legislation It looks like it will pass US Telecom Association interim President and Chief Executive Officer Gary S Lytle told TR today after a press briefing to review the legislation It should get somewhere in the mid to high s he said referring to the number of members on the person panel that USTA predicts will vote for the bill at tomorrows markup session The bill cleared the telecommunications and the Internet subcommittee last month by a vote TR April Meanwhile a substitute version of HR that began circulating late last night Monday has sparked another round of bickering between Bell company interests and members of the competitive local exchange carrier and interexchange carrier industries The substitute released by Commerce Committee Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin R La incorporates the four amendments that were approved by the telecom subcommittee It also adds new language regarding FCC rules on ILECs resale of advanced services and line sharing and new definitions for Internet backbone services and Internet access service H Russell Frisby Jr president of the Competitive Telecommunications Association said the new provisions would make the legislation go from bad to worse under the guise of compromise The new definition of Internet backbone services is too broad he said as it would include too many services in a deregulated regime Mr Frisby also pointed to language that purportedly would preserve CLECs ability to implement line sharing The FCCs linesharing rules permit CLECs to offer data services over the highfrequency portion of a line while the ILEC continues to provide voice services over the lowerfrequency portion But Mr Frisby said the substitute bill would invalidate later FCC orders that put the meat on the bones of the linesharing mandates According to a copy of the substitute draft the FCCs rules on line sharing would remain intact but ILECs wouldnt be required to provide access to the highfrequency portion of the loop at the remote terminal a provision that another critic agrees would undercut the Commissions linesharing rules If line sharing is not allowed through remote terminals then of consumers will be denied residential broadband competition because of this bill the CLEC source said That claim however was disputed by Thomas J Tauke senior vice presidentpublic policy and external affairs for Verizon Communications Inc Speaking with reporters at the USTA press briefing Mr Tauke said the bills new linesharing language would have a minimal effect on CLECs in Verizons service territory because very few of them use line sharing For Verizon the substitute language would eliminate the economic and practical problems of providing for line sharing when we have fiber in the local loop he said Rep Tauzins substitute bill also has new language requiring ILECs to continue reselling advanced services at wholesale rates for as many as three years after enactment of the bill The original version of the bill would have given ILECs an immediate exemption from resale obligations Committee staffers were said to be working out lastminute details on another amendment thats expected to be offered tomorrow by Reps Cliff Stearns R Fla Bobby L Rush D Ill and Thomas C Sawyer D Ohio According to sources the amendment would give ILECs immediate regulatory relief But it would require ILECs to make about of their central offices DSL digital subscriber lineready by a date certain most likely within three years of enactment Mr Tauke said Verizon would oppose any DSL buildout requirements saying its good public policy not to have a buildout provision in this legislation The government should mandate buildout requirements only when the market isnt working he said Many of the same amendments that were withdrawn during the telecom subcommittees review are being teed up for tomorrow including several from Rep Tom Davis III R Va and one from Rep Anna Eshoo D Calif to require Bell companies to continue filing servicequality and accounting reports at the FCC Rep Tauzin has said he would address FCC enforcement issues at tomorrows markup session but he may not tackle those issues through legislation Asked by TR whether Rep Tauzin planned to offer an FCC enforcement amendment to HR spokesman Ken Johnson said today I can only confirm that Reps Tauzin and Rep Fred Upton R Mich will offer an amendment before the bill gets to the House floor to substantially beef up the FCCs enforcement tools JUDGE CLECs DONT HAVE TO GIVE ILECs ACCESS TO RIGHTSOFWAY A federal district judge in Lincoln Neb has ruled that competitive local exchange carriers CLECs arent required to give incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs access to their poles ducts and rightsofway Judge Richard G Kopf made the determination in ATT Communications of the Midwest Inc v U S WEST Communications Inc et al case no CV ATT brought the lawsuit in seeking to overturn the Nebraska Public Service Commissions approval of an interconnection agreement That agreement required ATT to give U S WEST now Qwest Corp reciprocal access to poles ducts and rightsofway Consideration of the lawsuit was delayed by judicial challenges to the FCCs landmark order on carrier interconnection Judge Kopf was faced with a split among federal courts on how to handle an apparent contradiction in the Communications Act of as amended by the Telecommunications Act of Section of the Act appears to require all local exchange carriers LECs whether ILECs or CLECs to grant access to their rightsofway the judge said But section seems to require that all LECs grant access only to competitive not incumbent local exchange carriers he said The FCC had based its regulations on section and most federal district courts had deferred to that interpretation Judge Kopf said But the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit San Francisco has said it doubts the soundness of the FCCs interpretation of section Judge Kopf however followed the other district courts and deferred to the FCCs interpretation He concluded that in light of the Acts purpose which is to promote competition the FCCs interpretation that no ILEC may seek access to the facilities or rightsofway of a LEC or any utility under either section of section is based on a permissible construction of the statutes and does not conflict with the plain meaning of the Act Judge Kopf ruled that the reciprocalaccess portion of the companies interconnection agreement violated the Act and the FCCs rules He enjoined Qwest from enforcing that portion of the agreement FCC PROPOSES CHANGING USF CONTRIBUTION SYSTEM The FCC has proposed streamlining and simplifying the way it collects Universal Service Fund USF contributions The proposals which include limiting how carriers recover contributions from their customers and using a flatrate assessment are aimed at dealing with recent changes and developing trends in the industry The FCC recently tweaked the USF contribution system to reduce the lag time between accrual of revenues and payment of contributions based on those revenues TR March At that time it said it soon would consider more fundamental modifica tions to the USF contribution mechanism The USF supports affordable service in highcost areas and discounted service for lowincome customers schools libraries and rural health care providers USF contributions currently are assessed as a percentage of carriers interstate and international enduser telecom service revenues The percentage is based on revenues as of six months before the contributions are collected The FCC allows carriers to decide for themselves whether and how to recover contribution costs from their customers In a statement today the FCC said the following industry trends affect USF contributions the entrance of new companies such as the Bells into certain long distance markets growth in the wireless telecom sector to the extent that wireless carriers interstate revenues may exceed the FCCs interim safe harbor threshold for contributions and increased bundling of services making it difficult to distinguish interstate from intrastate revenues The FCC is seeking comments on whether it should require carriers to contribute a percentage of their collected revenues rather than a percentage of their billed revenues to the USF It wants to know whether it should assess contributions based on current or projected revenues The Commission also asks whether it should use a flat assessment such as a fixed perline charge if it should require that carriers give customers a uniform description of contribution recovery charges and whether those charges should be limited to the amount of the contribution assessment FCCs WIRELESS BUREAU SIDES WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES ON E COSTS The FCCs Wireless Telecommunications Bureau has sided with public safety agencies in a dispute over who should bear more of the financial burden for installing Phase I enhanced E systems In a May letter to the King County Wash E Program bureau Chief Thomas J Sugrue clarified that the selective router maintained by incumbent local exchange carriers is the proper demarcation point for allocating E implementation costs between wireless carriers and public safety answering points PSAPs The bureaus determination supports the view held by PSAPs Carriers on the other hand had maintained that PSAPs should be responsible for E network components or upgrades beginning at carriers switches The bureau sought comments on the issue last year in response to King Countys request for a clarification of the FCCs position TR Aug and Sept In the letter Mr Sugrue stressed that the agency continues to favor negotiation between the parties as the most efficacious and efficient means for resolving disputes regarding cost allocations for implementing Phase I But PSAPs still will have to bear some costs he said including upgrades to the selective router trunking equipment and other hardware and software STUDY SAYS MOBILE PHONE USE PLAYS LITTLE ROLE IN ACCIDENTS Mobile phones are responsible for distracting drivers in only a small percentage of vehicle accidents according to an analysis of accident data released today The University of North Carolinas Highway Safety Research Center compiled the study for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety using data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations Crashworthiness Data System The data were collected from to on vehicles involved in crashes in which at least one vehicle was towed from the scene Results were weighted to calculate national estimates In crashes where driver distraction was a factor of the time that distraction was something outside the drivers vehicle the study found Drivers attempts to adjust car radios was a factor in of collisions involving driver distraction and passengers were a factor in of those crashes the study said Mobile phones were number eight on the list of driver distractions Use of wireless phones preceded of crashes where driver distraction was a factor the study said The margin of error for each category varied from to for mobile phone use it was Jane Stutts manager of epidemiological studies at the UNC center and the studys author told TR that the mobile phone results were surprising just because people assume that cell phones cause a lot of crashes But she stressed that many drivers may be reluctant to tell police that they were distracted by using a phone They may try to hide it she said The estimates for mobile phone use were based on only reported cases Ms Stutts also noted that the driver distraction was listed as unknown for almost of the cases studied She said this fact highlights the need for improved collection of accident data CABLEVISION WONT HELP ATT SELL B CABLEVISION STAKE Cablevision Systems Corp executives today said they dont intend to help ATT Corp sell billion in Cablevision shares ATT had asked Cablevision a cable TV system operator based in Bethpage NY to register the million shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission allowing for a public sale TR April Cablevision has notified ATT that we will not proceed at this time with the registration of their shares of Cablevision common stock said William Bell Cablevisions vice chairman Instead Cablevision is considering its own public stock sale to raise funds to improve its cable TV networks he said during a conference call with investors and analysts Cablevisions decision may complicate ATTs efforts to sell the shares which it inherited in the takeover of Tele Communications Inc ATT wants to sell the stake to raise funds for debt reduction and to thin its cable TV holdings The FCCs rules regarding cable TV ownership are in limbo after being vacated by the US Court of Appeals in Washington But ATT has been maneuvering to sell some cable TV holdings in preparation for the enactment of new rules ATT still can sell the Cablevision shares Mr Bell said ATT has piggyback registration rights that entitle it under certain conditions to add its shares to Cablevisions public stock offerings according to SEC documents ATT may or may not be able to exercise some piggyback rights Mr Bell said It really will depend on market conditions and what Cablevisions needs are FCC SEEKS EXTRA M FOR ENGINEERING PROGRAM The FCC is asking congressional appropriators to earmark an additional million for its fiscal year budget The funds would help pay for a new Excellence in Engineering training and recruitment program President Bush has proposed million for the FCC for FY an increase over the Commissions current appropriation level TR April In a letter to Sen Conrad Burns R Mont FCC Chairman Michael K Powell says the extra money would be used for recruitment incentives educational initiatives for advanced and nonengineers at the FCC and upgrading the agencys technical equipment The overarching goal of the program is to ensure that the Commission maintains a high level of technical expertise so that it is at least as fluent in technology and engineering issues as are the entities it regulates Mr Powell said in the May letter Mr Powells letter included draft legislation that would allow the FCC to establish salaries for engineers and other technical and professional hires that are more competitive with the private sector The proposal also authorizes each Commissioner to hire a professional engineering assistant in addition to the three professional assistants they currently are allowed A Burns spokeswoman said the lawmaker was working with Mr Powell to submit the budget request Sen Burns is chairman of the

Nord Sue Cc Guerrero Janel Subject National Transmission Grid Workshops Planned Sue Not sure who would be interested in these workshops from the RTO group if they are not already aware of these Note that these workshops will include discussion on RTOs and are taking place at the end of this month in three cities More info is at ntgsworkshopshtml NGIs Power Market Today published September National Transmission Grid Workshops Planned When President Bush unveiled his National Energy Policy NEP in May the plethora of recommendations included a proposal to establish a national electricity grid Now as the plan moves forward three workshops are scheduled this month to give all stakeholders a chance to participate in the National Transmission Grid Study NTGS The workshops set for Detroit on Sept Atlanta on Sept and Phoenix on Sept are expected to lay the foundation for a proposed transmission super highway As the NTGS sees it wholesale electricity market competition has changed the way the US electric grids are used Transmission systems that historically were used to move power within small utility service territories are now frequently stressed to their limits as large blocks of power are moved on a regional basis The new patterns of power flow higher electricity demand and a lack of investment has led to major transmission congestion across the country Transmission investments go far beyond acquiring rightsofway and building new power lines according to the NTGS Stateoftheart metering and telemetry upgrading the control centers computing capabilities and installing new technology will also be necessary if consumers are to fully realize the efficiency gains from competitive wholesale electric markets Could the entire US electricity grid be operated as one integrated whole or a few large integrated markets If it was an integrated whole or a few large markets how could officials assure the reliability of a national grid Those are just a couple of the questions participants will attempt to answer during the workshop sessions Removing major transmission bottlenecks will help unleash the economic benefits that are achieved through efficient and competitive electricity markets according to the NTGS But how to remove the bottlenecks still remains the biggest dilemma of all Investment barriers seen as keys to the puzzle include a lack of regional integrated planning difficulty in siting and uncertainty regarding investment risks and returns Basically the NTGS has identified several issues that will be covered in the allday workshops including transmission planning and new capacity needs transmission siting and permitting business models for transmission investment and operation operation of interconnected transmission systems reliability management and oversight and new transmission technologies Within the transmission planning issue participants will discuss appropriate measures and consideration of reliability and commerce along with siting and environmental effects Other planning issues include integration of planning for transmission generation and demandside management programs and the role of new technologies to reduce the need for large facilities Planning how new transmission facilities affect the ability of some generators to artificially raise market prices for energy also will be discussed Siting and permitting issues will include input on options to establish regional or federal siting institutions with the authority to obtain rightsofway for new projects as well as the options to improve existing statebased regimes Business model issues will include the political feasibility of choices for Regional Transmission Organizations as well as their effects on market efficiency system reliability operational efficiency transmission access and interconnection policies investment and innovation and regulatory oversight Workshop participants also will discuss who should make the decisions about reliability and the technical and economic bases for making decisions along with who should take the risks The restructured industry will require a more open and inclusive process for establishing mandatory standards and monitoring and enforcing compliance according to the NTGS One way to solve many of the problems will be through new transmission technologies A major part of the workshops will be to learn the capability and cost of new technologies that could improve the operation of the transmission system along with options available to support the development and deployment of new technologies in the current restructuring period The Detroit workshop set for Sept will be held at the Detroit Marriott Romulus at Metro Airport Flynn Dr Romulus The Atlanta workshop set for Sept will be held at the Hyatt Regency Peachtree St NE The Phoenix workshop will be Sept at the Phoenix Airport Marriott All three workshops will begin at am and adjourn by pm For those unable to participate in a workshop session the NTGS also will offer an opportunity for nonregistrants to make recommendations with a transcript of the proceedings for each workshop available Recommendations and comments also will be accepted through Oct by the NTGS To learn more about the workshops or to register contact NTGSs Zead Haddad at or by email at For technical

gives a pretty good foot view of telecom policy considerations Original Message From Paul Jackson mailto Sent Friday February PM To Subject powellinterns Gilder Letter to Chairman Powell Confidential The Wall Street Journal Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Friday February The Broadband Economy Needs a Hero By George Gilder and Bret Swanson Dear Mr Powell Whether you know it or not your leadership and decisions over the next four years will have more impact on the economy than those of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan Surely our stockmarket swoon of and stagnating economic growth in are partly due to the Feds inexplicable liquidity leash combined with the highest tax burden since World War II But the chief threats to the st century economy are the politicians bureaucrats and Silicon Valley knownothings responsible for Americas broadband connectivity crisis We owe Les Vadasz of Intel an apology for making fun of his prediction that narrowband links would prevail into the st century The Internet as we know it is about seven years old yet fewer than million of million American homes enjoy broadband and its wealth of social commercial and educational opportunities Contrary to popular belief the chief obstacle to progress is not entrenched Bell operating companies but a regulatory regime that presumes to level the playing field equalize access and promote competition The only result of these policies has been the effective nationalization and paralysis of broadband The Telecommunications Act ruled that in exchange for the right to enter the longdistance telephone business the Bells must open their residential copper lines to competitors as well as allow these competitors to locate equipment in Bell central offices and offer digital subscriber line DSL services over Bellowned copper In November the FCC issued a further decree forcing the Bells to stop dragging their feet and cooperate The FCC actions spawned a new category of startups known as broadband competitive local exchange carriers CLECs which planned to compete with the Bells Funded by billions of dollars in Silicon Valley venture capital and public offerings companies like Rhythms Northpoint Covad and Jato earned praise from libertarians in both Washington and Palo Alto Calif Northpoint even had freedomloving former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt on its board But despite all good intentions these were not hightech startups They became venture capitalfunded lobbying and litigation shops intent on forcing the Bells to share their copper With more press releases on new lawsuits than on new subscribers one of the companies epitomized the strategy Rhythms continues successful regulatory litigation The result of all this lawyering The CLECs won everything Access to copper wherever they sued Multimillion dollar awards from the Bells And bankruptcy Bankruptcy Late last year Northpoint filed for Chapter after Verizon withdrew an million investment Jato closed its doors Rhythms cut its staff by Covad is slashing jobs and closing central offices Of Covads lines in service are not recognizing revenue And all of this is happening in the face of massive consumer demand for broadband services The problem is that DSL is risky and hard Some studies have reported that of DSL hookups fail on the first try Even amicable relationships between CLECs and Bells are a software nightmare with a different billing and provisioning system for each service provider Such difficulties render DSL not a matter of will and politics but of technical and entrepreneurial risks Companies are forced to invest heavily in research and engineering personnel but have few opportunities for outsized rewards Thats because Congress and the FCC set up an awkward scheme in which everyone got a piece of the action but no one could make any money Often barred from carrying signals across longdistance boundaries the Bells hand off traffic to other longdistance carriers CLECs rent lines from the Bells And Internet service providers end up doing costly customer service and marketing to get people signed up in the first place In short as many as four parties routinely battle for low or negativemargin chunks of monthly bills By summoning new competition and then mandating the rivals cooperate in open access the government effectively privatized the risks and socialized the profits By December the Bells had signed up million users and the CLECs combining for just million DSL subscribers among the million or so copperconnected US homes and businesses Cable modems with million subscribers at yearend have done better but AOL Time Warner and ATT Americas two cable behemoths are bogged down by the same openaccess nonsense that plagues DSL Over the past two years ATT CEO Michael Armstrong acquired billion in cable assets while watching his companys billion market capitalization plummet to billion Just last month the Federal Trade Commission ruled that AOL Time Warner must offer at least one nonaffiliated cable broadband ISP Internet Service Provider service on Time Warners cable system before AOL itself begins offering service followed by two other nonaffiliated ISPs within days and a requirement to negotiate in good faith with others after that The nations secondlargest ISP EarthLink will now get access to AOLs expensive cables pretty much for free This regulatory morass treats the most dynamic technically creative and transformative industry in the world economy as if it were some static commodity market for corn or pork bellies Mr Chairman in a recent speech you made the key point that innovation is more important than price competition When it comes to leadingedge services and technologies narrow price competition is almost meaningless Internet innovation means qualitative change orderofmagnitude price reductions and constantly changing services that always constitute monopolies when first launched No Internet advantage can last more than a couple of years In and over million kilometers of optical fiber were laid worldwide enough to stretch to the sun Hundreds of billions of dollars have already been invested by metropolitan fiberoptic network builders Metromedia Fiber Level Communications optical hardware companies Avanex ONI Sorrento and optical service providers Yipes Cogent Sphera These companies are already rendering the metropolitan DSL debate moot with thousandfold increases in price performance over existing technology Similar breakthroughs are on the way in residential wireless But none of these deployments including fiber to the home can flourish under a regime of forced sharing of entrepreneurial assets and profits In this environment let the Bells compete in longdistance and extort any temporary profits they can from their local copper cages Let the cable companies capitalize on their advantage for the few years it will last Allow the infinite spectrum of air and fiber to be exploited in any way its owners wish Then sit back and nostalgically recall those early days of the Internet when we naively thought a economic growth rate was really something The broadband economy needs a hero

company interests predict the Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act HR will clear the House Energy and Commerce Committee by a comfortable margin tomorrow Opponents however hope that enough amendments and opposition will surface to dampen Congresss enthusiasm for broadband relief legislation It looks like it will pass US Telecom Association interim President and Chief Executive Officer Gary S Lytle told TR today after a press briefing to review the legislation It should get somewhere in the mid to high s he said referring to the number of members on the person panel that USTA predicts will vote for the bill at tomorrows markup session The bill cleared the telecommunications and the Internet subcommittee last month by a vote TR April Meanwhile a substitute version of HR that began circulating late last night Monday has sparked another round of bickering between Bell company interests and members of the competitive local exchange carrier and interexchange carrier industries The substitute released by Commerce Committee Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin R La incorporates the four amendments that were approved by the telecom subcommittee It also adds new language regarding FCC rules on ILECs resale of advanced services and line sharing and new definitions for Internet backbone services and Internet access service H Russell Frisby Jr president of the Competitive Telecommunications Association said the new provisions would make the legislation go from bad to worse under the guise of compromise The new definition of Internet backbone services is too broad he said as it would include too many services in a deregulated regime Mr Frisby also pointed to language that purportedly would preserve CLECs ability to implement line sharing The FCCs linesharing rules permit CLECs to offer data services over the highfrequency portion of a line while the ILEC continues to provide voice services over the lowerfrequency portion But Mr Frisby said the substitute bill would invalidate later FCC orders that put the meat on the bones of the linesharing mandates According to a copy of the substitute draft the FCCs rules on line sharing would remain intact but ILECs wouldnt be required to provide access to the highfrequency portion of the loop at the remote terminal a provision that another critic agrees would undercut the Commissions linesharing rules If line sharing is not allowed through remote terminals then of consumers will be denied residential broadband competition because of this bill the CLEC source said That claim however was disputed by Thomas J Tauke senior vice presidentpublic policy and external affairs for Verizon Communications Inc Speaking with reporters at the USTA press briefing Mr Tauke said the bills new linesharing language would have a minimal effect on CLECs in Verizons service territory because very few of them use line sharing For Verizon the substitute language would eliminate the economic and practical problems of providing for line sharing when we have fiber in the local loop he said Rep Tauzins substitute bill also has new language requiring ILECs to continue reselling advanced services at wholesale rates for as many as three years after enactment of the bill The original version of the bill would have given ILECs an immediate exemption from resale obligations Committee staffers were said to be working out lastminute details on another amendment thats expected to be offered tomorrow by Reps Cliff Stearns R Fla Bobby L Rush D Ill and Thomas C Sawyer D Ohio According to sources the amendment would give ILECs immediate regulatory relief But it would require ILECs to make about of their central offices DSL digital subscriber lineready by a date certain most likely within three years of enactment Mr Tauke said Verizon would oppose any DSL buildout requirements saying its good public policy not to have a buildout provision in this legislation The government should mandate buildout requirements only when the market isnt working he said Many of the same amendments that were withdrawn during the telecom subcommittees review are being teed up for tomorrow including several from Rep Tom Davis III R Va and one from Rep Anna Eshoo D Calif to require Bell companies to continue filing servicequality and accounting reports at the FCC Rep Tauzin has said he would address FCC enforcement issues at tomorrows markup session but he may not tackle those issues through legislation Asked by TR whether Rep Tauzin planned to offer an FCC enforcement amendment to HR spokesman Ken Johnson said today I can only confirm that Reps Tauzin and Rep Fred Upton R Mich will offer an amendment before the bill gets to the House floor to substantially beef up the FCCs enforcement tools JUDGE CLECs DONT HAVE TO GIVE ILECs ACCESS TO RIGHTSOFWAY A federal district judge in Lincoln Neb has ruled that competitive local exchange carriers CLECs arent required to give incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs access to their poles ducts and rightsofway Judge Richard G Kopf made the determination in ATT Communications of the Midwest Inc v U S WEST Communications Inc et al case no CV ATT brought the lawsuit in seeking to overturn the Nebraska Public Service Commissions approval of an interconnection agreement That agreement required ATT to give U S WEST now Qwest Corp reciprocal access to poles ducts and rightsofway Consideration of the lawsuit was delayed by judicial challenges to the FCCs landmark order on carrier interconnection Judge Kopf was faced with a split among federal courts on how to handle an apparent contradiction in the Communications Act of as amended by the Telecommunications Act of Section of the Act appears to require all local exchange carriers LECs whether ILECs or CLECs to grant access to their rightsofway the judge said But section seems to require that all LECs grant access only to competitive not incumbent local exchange carriers he said The FCC had based its regulations on section and most federal district courts had deferred to that interpretation Judge Kopf said But the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit San Francisco has said it doubts the soundness of the FCCs interpretation of section Judge Kopf however followed the other district courts and deferred to the FCCs interpretation He concluded that in light of the Acts purpose which is to promote competition the FCCs interpretation that no ILEC may seek access to the facilities or rightsofway of a LEC or any utility under either section of section is based on a permissible construction of the statutes and does not conflict with the plain meaning of the Act Judge Kopf ruled that the reciprocalaccess portion of the companies interconnection agreement violated the Act and the FCCs rules He enjoined Qwest from enforcing that portion of the agreement FCC PROPOSES CHANGING USF CONTRIBUTION SYSTEM The FCC has proposed streamlining and simplifying the way it collects Universal Service Fund USF contributions The proposals which include limiting how carriers recover contributions from their customers and using a flatrate assessment are aimed at dealing with recent changes and developing trends in the industry The FCC recently tweaked the USF contribution system to reduce the lag time between accrual of revenues and payment of contributions based on those revenues TR March At that time it said it soon would consider more fundamental modifica tions to the USF contribution mechanism The USF supports affordable service in highcost areas and discounted service for lowincome customers schools libraries and rural health care providers USF contributions currently are assessed as a percentage of carriers interstate and international enduser telecom service revenues The percentage is based on revenues as of six months before the contributions are collected The FCC allows carriers to decide for themselves whether and how to recover contribution costs from their customers In a statement today the FCC said the following industry trends affect USF contributions the entrance of new companies such as the Bells into certain long distance markets growth in the wireless telecom sector to the extent that wireless carriers interstate revenues may exceed the FCCs interim safe harbor threshold for contributions and increased bundling of services making it difficult to distinguish interstate from intrastate revenues The FCC is seeking comments on whether it should require carriers to contribute a percentage of their collected revenues rather than a percentage of their billed revenues to the USF It wants to know whether it should assess contributions based on current or projected revenues The Commission also asks whether it should use a flat assessment such as a fixed perline charge if it should require that carriers give customers a uniform description of contribution recovery charges and whether those charges should be limited to the amount of the contribution assessment FCCs WIRELESS BUREAU SIDES WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES ON E COSTS The FCCs Wireless Telecommunications Bureau has sided with public safety agencies in a dispute over who should bear more of the financial burden for installing Phase I enhanced E systems In a May letter to the King County Wash E Program bureau Chief Thomas J Sugrue clarified that the selective router maintained by incumbent local exchange carriers is the proper demarcation point for allocating E implementation costs between wireless carriers and public safety answering points PSAPs The bureaus determination supports the view held by PSAPs Carriers on the other hand had maintained that PSAPs should be responsible for E network components or upgrades beginning at carriers switches The bureau sought comments on the issue last year in response to King Countys request for a clarification of the FCCs position TR Aug and Sept In the letter Mr Sugrue stressed that the agency continues to favor negotiation between the parties as the most efficacious and efficient means for resolving disputes regarding cost allocations for implementing Phase I But PSAPs still will have to bear some costs he said including upgrades to the selective router trunking equipment and other hardware and software STUDY SAYS MOBILE PHONE USE PLAYS LITTLE ROLE IN ACCIDENTS Mobile phones are responsible for distracting drivers in only a small percentage of vehicle accidents according to an analysis of accident data released today The University of North Carolinas Highway Safety Research Center compiled the study for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety using data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations Crashworthiness Data System The data were collected from to on vehicles involved in crashes in which at least one vehicle was towed from the scene Results were weighted to calculate national estimates In crashes where driver distraction was a factor of the time that distraction was something outside the drivers vehicle the study found Drivers attempts to adjust car radios was a factor in of collisions involving driver distraction and passengers were a factor in of those crashes the study said Mobile phones were number eight on the list of driver distractions Use of wireless phones preceded of crashes where driver distraction was a factor the study said The margin of error for each category varied from to for mobile phone use it was Jane Stutts manager of epidemiological studies at the UNC center and the studys author told TR that the mobile phone results were surprising just because people assume that cell phones cause a lot of crashes But she stressed that many drivers may be reluctant to tell police that they were distracted by using a phone They may try to hide it she said The estimates for mobile phone use were based on only reported cases Ms Stutts also noted that the driver distraction was listed as unknown for almost of the cases studied She said this fact highlights the need for improved collection of accident data CABLEVISION WONT HELP ATT SELL B CABLEVISION STAKE Cablevision Systems Corp executives today said they dont intend to help ATT Corp sell billion in Cablevision shares ATT had asked Cablevision a cable TV system operator based in Bethpage NY to register the million shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission allowing for a public sale TR April Cablevision has notified ATT that we will not proceed at this time with the registration of their shares of Cablevision common stock said William Bell Cablevisions vice chairman Instead Cablevision is considering its own public stock sale to raise funds to improve its cable TV networks he said during a conference call with investors and analysts Cablevisions decision may complicate ATTs efforts to sell the shares which it inherited in the takeover of Tele Communications Inc ATT wants to sell the stake to raise funds for debt reduction and to thin its cable TV holdings The FCCs rules regarding cable TV ownership are in limbo after being vacated by the US Court of Appeals in Washington But ATT has been maneuvering to sell some cable TV holdings in preparation for the enactment of new rules ATT still can sell the Cablevision shares Mr Bell said ATT has piggyback registration rights that entitle it under certain conditions to add its shares to Cablevisions public stock offerings according to SEC documents ATT may or may not be able to exercise some piggyback rights Mr Bell said It really will depend on market conditions and what Cablevisions needs are FCC SEEKS EXTRA M FOR ENGINEERING PROGRAM The FCC is asking congressional appropriators to earmark an additional million for its fiscal year budget The funds would help pay for a new Excellence in Engineering training and recruitment program President Bush has proposed million for the FCC for FY an increase over the Commissions current appropriation level TR April In a letter to Sen Conrad Burns R Mont FCC Chairman Michael K Powell says the extra money would be used for recruitment incentives educational initiatives for advanced and nonengineers at the FCC and upgrading the agencys technical equipment The overarching goal of the program is to ensure that the Commission maintains a high level of technical expertise so that it is at least as fluent in technology and engineering issues as are the entities it regulates Mr Powell said in the May letter Mr Powells letter included draft legislation that would allow the FCC to establish salaries for engineers and other technical and professional hires that are more competitive with the private sector The proposal also authorizes each Commissioner to hire a professional engineering assistant in addition to the three professional assistants they currently are allowed A Burns spokeswoman said the lawmaker was working with Mr Powell to submit the budget request Sen Burns is chairman of the communications subcommittee and is a member of the Appropriations Committee NEWS IN BRIEF Frank Malpartida has been named managing directorinternational sales in the new Miami office of Progress

relationships but With the DC office appearing only in supporting roles on reports like these Rick and Steve Kean are going to continue to have the impression that we exist to schedule meetings and execute plans formulated by others You know this is a sensitive point for me personally but beyond that it is important to my career development that I be seen as taking more of a lead I suppose Allison would feel the same way once she becomes more comfortable and familiar with the issues Therefore two requests Would you consider listing Allison and me as individuals not as DC Office Also and here I may be pushing it as you and I have discussed a couple of times am I taking the lead in the cable issue What about the BLM issue I always appear to Rick and Steve to be supporting Scott on these initiatives In my own twisted mind I think of myself as having more of a leadership role Sorry to continue to be ultra sensitive about this But frankly just between the two of us please since

reason that Ive used DC Office is that Linda has indicated that she wants to distinguish between your assignments and Allisons assignments Im not sure if shes done this yet and I didnt want to presume anything If it works better to list your names individually I am happy to do that To be honest though I dont think Rick would be likely to interpret this to mean that your role is simply administrative Are you around at the end of the day today I have a meeting from but maybe we could talk afterward about the other issues you raise Thanks Sue Sue Nord Sr Director Government Affairs Stephen D Burns AM To Sue nron cc Subject EBS Government Affairs Regulatory Report for May Hi Sue This may be a function of the Washington officeEBS Government Affairs differing reporting relationships but With the DC office appearing only in supporting roles on reports like these Rick and Steve Kean are going to continue to have the impression that we exist to schedule meetings and execute plans formulated by others You know this is a sensitive point for me personally but beyond that it is important to my career development that I be seen as taking more of a lead I suppose Allison would feel the same way once she becomes more comfortable and familiar with the issues Therefore two requests Would you consider listing Allison and me as individuals not as DC Office Also and here I may be pushing it as you and I have discussed a couple of times am I taking the lead in the cable issue What about the BLM issue I always appear to Rick and Steve to be supporting Scott on these initiatives In my own twisted mind I think of myself as having more of a leadership role Sorry to continue to be ultra sensitive about this But frankly just between the two of us please since weve just brought on new Senior Directors in the past month knocking me a couple of rungs down the seniority ladder in one fell swoop I am trying to increase my visibility and maybe claim a little

company interests predict the Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act HR will clear the House Energy and Commerce Committee by a comfortable margin tomorrow Opponents however hope that enough amendments and opposition will surface to dampen Congresss enthusiasm for broadband relief legislation It looks like it will pass US Telecom Association interim President and Chief Executive Officer Gary S Lytle told TR today after a press briefing to review the legislation It should get somewhere in the mid to high s he said referring to the number of members on the person panel that USTA predicts will vote for the bill at tomorrows markup session The bill cleared the telecommunications and the Internet subcommittee last month by a vote TR April Meanwhile a substitute version of HR that began circulating late last night Monday has sparked another round of bickering between Bell company interests and members of the competitive local exchange carrier and interexchange carrier industries The substitute released by Commerce Committee Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin R La incorporates the four amendments that were approved by the telecom subcommittee It also adds new language regarding FCC rules on ILECs resale of advanced services and line sharing and new definitions for Internet backbone services and Internet access service H Russell Frisby Jr president of the Competitive Telecommunications Association said the new provisions would make the legislation go from bad to worse under the guise of compromise The new definition of Internet backbone services is too broad he said as it would include too many services in a deregulated regime Mr Frisby also pointed to language that purportedly would preserve CLECs ability to implement line sharing The FCCs linesharing rules permit CLECs to offer data services over the highfrequency portion of a line while the ILEC continues to provide voice services over the lowerfrequency portion But Mr Frisby said the substitute bill would invalidate later FCC orders that put the meat on the bones of the linesharing mandates According to a copy of the substitute draft the FCCs rules on line sharing would remain intact but ILECs wouldnt be required to provide access to the highfrequency portion of the loop at the remote terminal a provision that another critic agrees would undercut the Commissions linesharing rules If line sharing is not allowed through remote terminals then of consumers will be denied residential broadband competition because of this bill the CLEC source said That claim however was disputed by Thomas J Tauke senior vice presidentpublic policy and external affairs for Verizon Communications Inc Speaking with reporters at the USTA press briefing Mr Tauke said the bills new linesharing language would have a minimal effect on CLECs in Verizons service territory because very few of them use line sharing For Verizon the substitute language would eliminate the economic and practical problems of providing for line sharing when we have fiber in the local loop he said Rep Tauzins substitute bill also has new language requiring ILECs to continue reselling advanced services at wholesale rates for as many as three years after enactment of the bill The original version of the bill would have given ILECs an immediate exemption from resale obligations Committee staffers were said to be working out lastminute details on another amendment thats expected to be offered tomorrow by Reps Cliff Stearns R Fla Bobby L Rush D Ill and Thomas C Sawyer D Ohio According to sources the amendment would give ILECs immediate regulatory relief But it would require ILECs to make about of their central offices DSL digital subscriber lineready by a date certain most likely within three years of enactment Mr Tauke said Verizon would oppose any DSL buildout requirements saying its good public policy not to have a buildout provision in this legislation The government should mandate buildout requirements only when the market isnt working he said Many of the same amendments that were withdrawn during the telecom subcommittees review are being teed up for tomorrow including several from Rep Tom Davis III R Va and one from Rep Anna Eshoo D Calif to require Bell companies to continue filing servicequality and accounting reports at the FCC Rep Tauzin has said he would address FCC enforcement issues at tomorrows markup session but he may not tackle those issues through legislation Asked by TR whether Rep Tauzin planned to offer an FCC enforcement amendment to HR spokesman Ken Johnson said today I can only confirm that Reps Tauzin and Rep Fred Upton R Mich will offer an amendment before the bill gets to the House floor to substantially beef up the FCCs enforcement tools JUDGE CLECs DONT HAVE TO GIVE ILECs ACCESS TO RIGHTSOFWAY A federal district judge in Lincoln Neb has ruled that competitive local exchange carriers CLECs arent required to give incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs access to their poles ducts and rightsofway Judge Richard G Kopf made the determination in ATT Communications of the Midwest Inc v U S WEST Communications Inc et al case no CV ATT brought the lawsuit in seeking to overturn the Nebraska Public Service Commissions approval of an interconnection agreement That agreement required ATT to give U S WEST now Qwest Corp reciprocal access to poles ducts and rightsofway Consideration of the lawsuit was delayed by judicial challenges to the FCCs landmark order on carrier interconnection Judge Kopf was faced with a split among federal courts on how to handle an apparent contradiction in the Communications Act of as amended by the Telecommunications Act of Section of the Act appears to require all local exchange carriers LECs whether ILECs or CLECs to grant access to their rightsofway the judge said But section seems to require that all LECs grant access only to competitive not incumbent local exchange carriers he said The FCC had based its regulations on section and most federal district courts had deferred to that interpretation Judge Kopf said But the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit San Francisco has said it doubts the soundness of the FCCs interpretation of section Judge Kopf however followed the other district courts and deferred to the FCCs interpretation He concluded that in light of the Acts purpose which is to promote competition the FCCs interpretation that no ILEC may seek access to the facilities or rightsofway of a LEC or any utility under either section of section is based on a permissible construction of the statutes and does not conflict with the plain meaning of the Act Judge Kopf ruled that the reciprocalaccess portion of the companies interconnection agreement violated the Act and the FCCs rules He enjoined Qwest from enforcing that portion of the agreement FCC PROPOSES CHANGING USF CONTRIBUTION SYSTEM The FCC has proposed streamlining and simplifying the way it collects Universal Service Fund USF contributions The proposals which include limiting how carriers recover contributions from their customers and using a flatrate assessment are aimed at dealing with recent changes and developing trends in the industry The FCC recently tweaked the USF contribution system to reduce the lag time between accrual of revenues and payment of contributions based on those revenues TR March At that time it said it soon would consider more fundamental modifica tions to the USF contribution mechanism The USF supports affordable service in highcost areas and discounted service for lowincome customers schools libraries and rural health care providers USF contributions currently are assessed as a percentage of carriers interstate and international enduser telecom service revenues The percentage is based on revenues as of six months before the contributions are collected The FCC allows carriers to decide for themselves whether and how to recover contribution costs from their customers In a statement today the FCC said the following industry trends affect USF contributions the entrance of new companies such as the Bells into certain long distance markets growth in the wireless telecom sector to the extent that wireless carriers interstate revenues may exceed the FCCs interim safe harbor threshold for contributions and increased bundling of services making it difficult to distinguish interstate from intrastate revenues The FCC is seeking comments on whether it should require carriers to contribute a percentage of their collected revenues rather than a percentage of their billed revenues to the USF It wants to know whether it should assess contributions based on current or projected revenues The Commission also asks whether it should use a flat assessment such as a fixed perline charge if it should require that carriers give customers a uniform description of contribution recovery charges and whether those charges should be limited to the amount of the contribution assessment FCCs WIRELESS BUREAU SIDES WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES ON E COSTS The FCCs Wireless Telecommunications Bureau has sided with public safety agencies in a dispute over who should bear more of the financial burden for installing Phase I enhanced E systems In a May letter to the King County Wash E Program bureau Chief Thomas J Sugrue clarified that the selective router maintained by incumbent local exchange carriers is the proper demarcation point for allocating E implementation costs between wireless carriers and public safety answering points PSAPs The bureaus determination supports the view held by PSAPs Carriers on the other hand had maintained that PSAPs should be responsible for E network components or upgrades beginning at carriers switches The bureau sought comments on the issue last year in response to King Countys request for a clarification of the FCCs position TR Aug and Sept In the letter Mr Sugrue stressed that the agency continues to favor negotiation between the parties as the most efficacious and efficient means for resolving disputes regarding cost allocations for implementing Phase I But PSAPs still will have to bear some costs he said including upgrades to the selective router trunking equipment and other hardware and software STUDY SAYS MOBILE PHONE USE PLAYS LITTLE ROLE IN ACCIDENTS Mobile phones are responsible for distracting drivers in only a small percentage of vehicle accidents according to an analysis of accident data released today The University of North Carolinas Highway Safety Research Center compiled the study for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety using data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations Crashworthiness Data System The data were collected from to on vehicles involved in crashes in which at least one vehicle was towed from the scene Results were weighted to calculate national estimates In crashes where driver distraction was a factor of the time that distraction was something outside the drivers vehicle the study found Drivers attempts to adjust car radios was a factor in of collisions involving driver distraction and passengers were a factor in of those crashes the study said Mobile phones were number eight on the list of driver distractions Use of wireless phones preceded of crashes where driver distraction was a factor the study said The margin of error for each category varied from to for mobile phone use it was Jane Stutts manager of epidemiological studies at the UNC center and the studys author told TR that the mobile phone results were surprising just because people assume that cell phones cause a lot of crashes But she stressed that many drivers may be reluctant to tell police that they were distracted by using a phone They may try to hide it she said The estimates for mobile phone use were based on only reported cases Ms Stutts also noted that the driver distraction was listed as unknown for almost of the cases studied She said this fact highlights the need for improved collection of accident data CABLEVISION WONT HELP ATT SELL B CABLEVISION STAKE Cablevision Systems Corp executives today said they dont intend to help ATT Corp sell billion in Cablevision shares ATT had asked Cablevision a cable TV system operator based in Bethpage NY to register the million shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission allowing for a public sale TR April Cablevision has notified ATT that we will not proceed at this time with the registration of their shares of Cablevision common stock said William Bell Cablevisions vice chairman Instead Cablevision is considering its own public stock sale to raise funds to improve its cable TV networks he said during a conference call with investors and analysts Cablevisions decision may complicate ATTs efforts to sell the shares which it inherited in the takeover of Tele Communications Inc ATT wants to sell the stake to raise funds for debt reduction and to thin its cable TV holdings The FCCs rules regarding cable TV ownership are in limbo after being vacated by the US Court of Appeals in Washington But ATT has been maneuvering to sell some cable TV holdings in preparation for the enactment of new rules ATT still can sell the Cablevision shares Mr Bell said ATT has piggyback registration rights that entitle it under certain conditions to add its shares to Cablevisions public stock offerings according to SEC documents ATT may or may not be able to exercise some piggyback rights Mr Bell said It really will depend on market conditions and what Cablevisions needs are FCC SEEKS EXTRA M FOR ENGINEERING PROGRAM The FCC is asking congressional appropriators to earmark an additional million for its fiscal year budget The funds would help pay for a new Excellence in Engineering training and recruitment program President Bush has proposed million for the FCC for FY an increase over the Commissions current appropriation level TR April In a letter to Sen Conrad Burns R Mont FCC Chairman Michael K Powell says the extra money would be used for recruitment incentives educational initiatives for advanced and nonengineers at the FCC and upgrading the agencys technical equipment The overarching goal of the program is to ensure that the Commission maintains a high level of technical expertise so that it is at least as fluent in technology and engineering issues as are the entities it regulates Mr Powell said in the May letter Mr Powells letter included draft legislation that would allow the FCC to establish salaries for engineers and other technical and professional hires that are more competitive with the private sector The proposal also authorizes each Commissioner to hire a professional engineering assistant in addition to the three professional assistants they currently are allowed A Burns spokeswoman said the lawmaker was working with Mr Powell to submit the budget request Sen Burns is chairman of the

end I would ask that each of Accounting Regulatory and Legal send no more than two representatives to participate in the TARL meeting in Houston A commercial person should attend as well The only exception to this rule should be a temporary exception for you and Mike to call in with other exceptions to be made as hot issues arise Angie will see what she can do about arranging a videoconference

Communications Subject Re TARL MEETINGS Dear all Following my experience of the last meeting my feeling is that we need more to focus on some items instead of having ever expanding discussions I am in favour of having smaller meetings instead of big cometogethers I thing that meeting should focus on two or three subjects and having smaller teams to work out solutions on specified tasks I also think that we can achieve better time efficiency without losing the learning effect of discussing A second point would be my preference to have you on the screen In particular for those dialling in from abroad it would be helpful in order to better follow the discussion Lastly I wonder whether it would not be useful to have short minutes of every meeting for those who did not succeed in participating

telecom and Internetrelated legislation is being promised by Senate communications subcommittee Chairman Conrad Burns R Mont Sen Burns who dubbed his hightech agenda for the previous Congress the Digital Dozen plans to unveil a package of telecom and Internet bills next week that will be called The Tech Seven this time around A spokesman said Sen Burns agenda will include a few holdover bills that didnt make it through the th Congress as well as some surprises They include proposals to expand deployment of broadband services using lowpower TV spectrum to ease reporting requirements for small incumbent local exchange carriers and to lift the caps on universal service support the spokesman said The other top priorities on Sen Burns agenda are bills to bolster online privacy and to curb spamming Sen Burns also may address the process by which the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN selects Internet domain name suffixes through legislation or through the subcommittees oversight capacity the spokesman said Member assignments for the Senate communications subcommittee are expected to be announced later this week Sources say Republican freshmen George Allen Va and John Ensign Nev share the inside track for the panels vacant GOP spots while Democrat John R Edwards NC is considered a lock to fill one of the Democratic seats Meanwhile efforts to organize the House telecommunications subcommittee have bogged down in a debate over whether to add seats to the full House Energy and Commerce Committee says committee spokesman Ken Johnson Theres still a possibility that additional members will be added to the Commerce Committee he told TR Late today Mr Johnson said Commerce still plans to meet tomorrow Wednesday to vote on subcommittee assignments and to organize for the th Congress BROADBAND SERVICES ONLINE PRIVACY TOP AeAs AGENDA In a report sent to the White House and Congress today the AeA formerly the American Electronics Association recommends that federal policymakers take a handsoff approach to regulating those sectors of the broadband market that are served by multiple providers AeAs competitive markets include residential areas served by cable DSL digital subscriber line and satellite providers AeA calls for more efforts at the federal level to promote competition in sectors such as multitentant buildings where there are bottlenecks to competitive entry And it says the FCC should continue to show regulatory restraint with respect to emerging services given the fact that the market for such services while still nascent is functioning in a competition fashion Briefing reporters in Washington today AeA President and Chief Executive Officer William T Archey said the organizations report reflects the views of AeA member companies that participated in a series of town hall meetings held last year In addition to the telecom items the report urges Congress to extend the current threeyear moratorium on new or nondiscriminatory Internet taxes and permanently ban the taxation of Internet access services It reiterates AeAs preference for federal preemption of state privacy laws TR Jan Wireless

COMP COULD GET WORSE onlinetrdtdTdhtm NEWS IN BRIEF onlinetrdtdTdhtm FRUSTRATED JUDGES FOCUS ON BACKGROUND IN AVERAGE SCHEDULE CASE Appeals court judges today vented their exasperation at the inability of attorneys to explain how universal service support for each small average schedule company is determined The attorney representing the FCC bore the brunt of the judges frustrations and at times caustic comments on that issue But on the legal issues the lawyer representing the National Exchange Carrier Association Inc in its challenge to an FCC decision seemed to take the harder hits The US Court of Appeals in Washington must decide whether the FCC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in prescribing a increase in average schedule universal service support Average schedule companies use formulas derived by NECA and approved by the FCC to approximate their perloop costs of providing service This is in contrast to socalled cost companies which perform studies to calculate their actual perloop costs The case marks the first time that NECA which the FCC has charged with updating the formula used by average schedule companies to calculate universal service support has asked the court to review an FCC order NECA attorney Richard A Askoff pointed out during oral arguments this morning The judges spent as much time seeking information on how the average schedule mechanism works as they did questioning attorneys about their legal arguments Judge David S Tatel asked for clarification of how the average schedule formula was applied to individual companies After FCC attorney Laurel Bergold spent nearly all her allotted time in an unsuccessful attempt to clarify that aspect of the case Chief Judge Harry T Edwards commented We get hard things from the FCC but this case is bizarre Mr Askoff apparently cleared up the matter for the judges during his rebuttal arguments He explained that certain data such as the number of loops per exchange is plugged into the average schedule formula to determine a given carriers amount of support But Mr Askoff faced some tough questions from Judge Douglas H Ginsburg regarding NECAs argument that it hadnt received proper notice of the FCCs intention to prescribe the adjustment Judge Ginsburg wondered what NECA would have said to the FCC if it had received notice that it didnt say in advocating a increase in universal service support for average schedule carriers Mr Askoff said NECA would have discussed the fallacy of the FCCs belief that universal service support should be tied to growth in the number of local loops Judge Edwards replied that NECA already had made that argument before the FCC The case National Exchange Carrier Association Inc v FCC no stems from an FCC decision to reject NECAs proposed average schedule universal service formula for CLECs WANT RECORD ON PACIFIC BELL InterLATA SERVICE BID REFRESHED The California Office of Ratepayer Advocates several trade associations representing competitive local exchange carriers CLECs and nine individual CLECs have asked the state Public Utilities Commission to refresh its record on Pacific Bells compliance with federally mandated marketopening standards before deciding whether the telco has met those standards In a joint petition filed Friday Feb they argued that the record in th e proceeding was too stale for the commission to reach credible conclusions about Pacific Bells compliance with the marketopening mandates by May the date the commission is scheduled to issue a final decision Compliance with a point competitive checklist of marketopening moves outlined in section of the federal Telecommunications Act of is a prerequisite to Bell companies receiving FCC authorization to provide inregion interLATA local access and transport area service The FCC is required to consult with relevant state commissions and the Justice Department before ruling on a Bell companys section application Bell companies typically try to convince the state regulators of their compliance before submitting an application to the FCC The joint petitioners told the California commission that the record in the proceeding could be supplemented in a relatively prompt and efficient manner If Pacific Bell intends to include updated or other additional information in its application to be filed with the FCC then it should make thatinformation available to the California commission and the parties to this proceeding now the petitioners said Such action would be consistent with the FCCs goal that the state commission be the principal forum for resolving factual disputes in the first instance rather than require the California commission and the parties to address Pacific Bells showing for the first time after being thrust into an expedited review process before the federal agency in Washington DC In addition to the Office of Ratepayer Advocates the joint petitioners were the California Association of Competitive Telecommunications Companies the Association of Communications Enterprises the Competitive Telecommunications Association ATT Communications of California Inc WorldCom Inc Advanced Telcom Inc XO California Inc Spring Communications Co LP New Edge Network Inc ICG Telecom Group Inc Rhythms Links Inc and Time Warner Telecom of California Inc CONSUMER GROUPS CALL FOR PROCOMPETITIVE FCC ACTION The Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union today issued a report stating that policymakers have failed in their attempt to expand consumer choice in local and broadband services In Lessons from the Telecommunications Act the groups called for increased regulation of large companies that continue to monopolize the cable TV and local telephone industries The report said the Acts failure stems from the fact that the major providers of cable TV and local phone service have chosen to merge rather than compete Most of the local phone service market still belongs to the regional Bell monopolies which thanks to a series of mergers have shrunk from seven companies in into just four today the groups said The report asked lawmakers to promote meaningful competition among local service providers by pressing for adoption of certain marketopening principles nationwide It specifically cites local marketopening moves in New York and Texas In the broadband services market a handful of dominant companies have refused to enter each others markets agreeing instead to merge and swap assets the report says Cable monopolies have saddled consumers with huge rate increases and sought to impose their closed business model on the broadband Internet by making it nearly impossible for outside companies to offer Internet services over the monopolies cable lines the groups stated They asked lawmakers to put an end to abusive cable TV pricing practices require telcos to provide nondiscriminatory access to their highspeed networks enforce media ownership limits that promote diversity and block further consolidation that undermines potential competition MOBILE PHONE INDUSTRY FACES LATEST HEALTHRELATED LAWSUIT The wireless phone industry is facing another lawsuit this one filed on behalf of a yearold Georgia man who says his cellphone caused his brain tumor Its the latest in a growing number of such lawsuits alleging that the industry manufactured and marketed the devices despite knowing their potential adverse health effects The lawsuit Brian Lane Barrett and Diana Barrett v Nokia Corp et al case noCV was filed in Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta Jan In addition to Nokia the lawsuit names BellSouth Mobility Inc and the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association now the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association as defendants It seeks compensatory and punitive damages but doesnt list an amount The count lawsuit claims that the defendants knew or should have known the phones to be defective unreasonably dangerous and hazardous Spokespersons for the defendants declined to comment on the lawsuit ILECs DISTORTIONS FROM RECIP COMP COULD GET WORSE Incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs say their reciprocal compensation payments to competitive local exchange carriers CLECs are continuing to increase making it even more imperative that the FCC change its rules regarding the payments between carriers for terminating local traffic The ILECs told the FCC that declining network costs and increasing traffic flows are producing ever greater economic inefficiencies and distortions Robert T Blau vice presidentexecutive and federal regulatory affairs at BellSouth Corp addressed the issue in a Feb letter to Common Carrier Bureau Chief Dorothy Attwood He wrote on behalf of BellSouth SBC Communications Inc Verizon Communications Inc and Qwest Communications International Inc Mr Blau acknowledged that reciprocal compensation rates are declining but he said dialup traffic to the Internet is increasing faster Most observers project that dialup access minutes will continue to grow rapidly for at least the next three years Mr Blau said In addition changes in technology and capital cost reductions are offsetting reciprocal compensation declines he said Mr Blau estimated that the cost to CLECs of carrying dialup calls to Internet service providers ISPs works out to about per minute or about to of current reciprocal compensation rates He said eliminating reciprocal compensation in favor of a billandkeep system would not force CLECs to raise perline fees for ISP customers NEWS IN BRIEF Former National

gives a pretty good foot view of telecom policy considerations Original Message From Paul Jackson mailto Sent Friday February PM To Subject powellinterns Gilder Letter to Chairman Powell Confidential The Wall Street Journal Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Friday February The Broadband Economy Needs a Hero By George Gilder and Bret Swanson Dear Mr Powell Whether you know it or not your leadership and decisions over the next four years will have more impact on the economy than those of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan Surely our stockmarket swoon of and stagnating economic growth in are partly due to the Feds inexplicable liquidity leash combined with the highest tax burden since World War II But the chief threats to the st century economy are the politicians bureaucrats and Silicon Valley knownothings responsible for Americas broadband connectivity crisis We owe Les Vadasz of Intel an apology for making fun of his prediction that narrowband links would prevail into the st century The Internet as we know it is about seven years old yet fewer than million of million American homes enjoy broadband and its wealth of social commercial and educational opportunities Contrary to popular belief the chief obstacle to progress is not entrenched Bell operating companies but a regulatory regime that presumes to level the playing field equalize access and promote competition The only result of these policies has been the effective nationalization and paralysis of broadband The Telecommunications Act ruled that in exchange for the right to enter the longdistance telephone business the Bells must open their residential copper lines to competitors as well as allow these competitors to locate equipment in Bell central offices and offer digital subscriber line DSL services over Bellowned copper In November the FCC issued a further decree forcing the Bells to stop dragging their feet and cooperate The FCC actions spawned a new category of startups known as broadband competitive local exchange carriers CLECs which planned to compete with the Bells Funded by billions of dollars in Silicon Valley venture capital and public offerings companies like Rhythms Northpoint Covad and Jato earned praise from libertarians in both Washington and Palo Alto Calif Northpoint even had freedomloving former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt on its board But despite all good intentions these were not hightech startups They became venture capitalfunded lobbying and litigation shops intent on forcing the Bells to share their copper With more press releases on new lawsuits than on new subscribers one of the companies epitomized the strategy Rhythms continues successful regulatory litigation The result of all this lawyering The CLECs won everything Access to copper wherever they sued Multimillion dollar awards from the Bells And bankruptcy Bankruptcy Late last year Northpoint filed for Chapter after Verizon withdrew an million investment Jato closed its doors Rhythms cut its staff by Covad is slashing jobs and closing central offices Of Covads lines in service are not recognizing revenue And all of this is happening in the face of massive consumer demand for broadband services The problem is that DSL is risky and hard Some studies have reported that of DSL hookups fail on the first try Even amicable relationships between CLECs and Bells are a software nightmare with a different billing and provisioning system for each service provider Such difficulties render DSL not a matter of will and politics but of technical and entrepreneurial risks Companies are forced to invest heavily in research and engineering personnel but have few opportunities for outsized rewards Thats because Congress and the FCC set up an awkward scheme in which everyone got a piece of the action but no one could make any money Often barred from carrying signals across longdistance boundaries the Bells hand off traffic to other longdistance carriers CLECs rent lines from the Bells And Internet service providers end up doing costly customer service and marketing to get people signed up in the first place In short as many as four parties routinely battle for low or negativemargin chunks of monthly bills By summoning new competition and then mandating the rivals cooperate in open access the government effectively privatized the risks and socialized the profits By December the Bells had signed up million users and the CLECs combining for just million DSL subscribers among the million or so copperconnected US homes and businesses Cable modems with million subscribers at yearend have done better but AOL Time Warner and ATT Americas two cable behemoths are bogged down by the same openaccess nonsense that plagues DSL Over the past two years ATT CEO Michael Armstrong acquired billion in cable assets while watching his companys billion market capitalization plummet to billion Just last month the Federal Trade Commission ruled that AOL Time Warner must offer at least one nonaffiliated cable broadband ISP Internet Service Provider service on Time Warners cable system before AOL itself begins offering service followed by two other nonaffiliated ISPs within days and a requirement to negotiate in good faith with others after that The nations secondlargest ISP EarthLink will now get access to AOLs expensive cables pretty much for free This regulatory morass treats the most dynamic technically creative and transformative industry in the world economy as if it were some static commodity market for corn or pork bellies Mr Chairman in a recent speech you made the key point that innovation is more important than price competition When it comes to leadingedge services and technologies narrow price competition is almost meaningless Internet innovation means qualitative change orderofmagnitude price reductions and constantly changing services that always constitute monopolies when first launched No Internet advantage can last more than a couple of years In and over million kilometers of optical fiber were laid worldwide enough to stretch to the sun Hundreds of billions of dollars have already been invested by metropolitan fiberoptic network builders Metromedia Fiber Level Communications optical hardware companies Avanex ONI Sorrento and optical service providers Yipes Cogent Sphera These companies are already rendering the metropolitan DSL debate moot with thousandfold increases in price performance over existing technology Similar breakthroughs are on the way in residential wireless But none of these deployments including fiber to the home can flourish under a regime of forced sharing of entrepreneurial assets and profits In this environment let the Bells compete in longdistance and extort any temporary profits they can from their local copper cages Let the cable companies capitalize on their advantage for the few years it will last Allow the infinite spectrum of air and fiber to be exploited in any way its owners wish Then sit back and nostalgically recall those early days of the Internet when we naively thought a economic growth rate was really something The broadband economy needs a hero

company interests predict the Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act HR will clear the House Energy and Commerce Committee by a comfortable margin tomorrow Opponents however hope that enough amendments and opposition will surface to dampen Congresss enthusiasm for broadband relief legislation It looks like it will pass US Telecom Association interim President and Chief Executive Officer Gary S Lytle told TR today after a press briefing to review the legislation It should get somewhere in the mid to high s he said referring to the number of members on the person panel that USTA predicts will vote for the bill at tomorrows markup session The bill cleared the telecommunications and the Internet subcommittee last month by a vote TR April Meanwhile a substitute version of HR that began circulating late last night Monday has sparked another round of bickering between Bell company interests and members of the competitive local exchange carrier and interexchange carrier industries The substitute released by Commerce Committee Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin R La incorporates the four amendments that were approved by the telecom subcommittee It also adds new language regarding FCC rules on ILECs resale of advanced services and line sharing and new definitions for Internet backbone services and Internet access service H Russell Frisby Jr president of the Competitive Telecommunications Association said the new provisions would make the legislation go from bad to worse under the guise of compromise The new definition of Internet backbone services is too broad he said as it would include too many services in a deregulated regime Mr Frisby also pointed to language that purportedly would preserve CLECs ability to implement line sharing The FCCs linesharing rules permit CLECs to offer data services over the highfrequency portion of a line while the ILEC continues to provide voice services over the lowerfrequency portion But Mr Frisby said the substitute bill would invalidate later FCC orders that put the meat on the bones of the linesharing mandates According to a copy of the substitute draft the FCCs rules on line sharing would remain intact but ILECs wouldnt be required to provide access to the highfrequency portion of the loop at the remote terminal a provision that another critic agrees would undercut the Commissions linesharing rules If line sharing is not allowed through remote terminals then of consumers will be denied residential broadband competition because of this bill the CLEC source said That claim however was disputed by Thomas J Tauke senior vice presidentpublic policy and external affairs for Verizon Communications Inc Speaking with reporters at the USTA press briefing Mr Tauke said the bills new linesharing language would have a minimal effect on CLECs in Verizons service territory because very few of them use line sharing For Verizon the substitute language would eliminate the economic and practical problems of providing for line sharing when we have fiber in the local loop he said Rep Tauzins substitute bill also has new language requiring ILECs to continue reselling advanced services at wholesale rates for as many as three years after enactment of the bill The original version of the bill would have given ILECs an immediate exemption from resale obligations Committee staffers were said to be working out lastminute details on another amendment thats expected to be offered tomorrow by Reps Cliff Stearns R Fla Bobby L Rush D Ill and Thomas C Sawyer D Ohio According to sources the amendment would give ILECs immediate regulatory relief But it would require ILECs to make about of their central offices DSL digital subscriber lineready by a date certain most likely within three years of enactment Mr Tauke said Verizon would oppose any DSL buildout requirements saying its good public policy not to have a buildout provision in this legislation The government should mandate buildout requirements only when the market isnt working he said Many of the same amendments that were withdrawn during the telecom subcommittees review are being teed up for tomorrow including several from Rep Tom Davis III R Va and one from Rep Anna Eshoo D Calif to require Bell companies to continue filing servicequality and accounting reports at the FCC Rep Tauzin has said he would address FCC enforcement issues at tomorrows markup session but he may not tackle those issues through legislation Asked by TR whether Rep Tauzin planned to offer an FCC enforcement amendment to HR spokesman Ken Johnson said today I can only confirm that Reps Tauzin and Rep Fred Upton R Mich will offer an amendment before the bill gets to the House floor to substantially beef up the FCCs enforcement tools JUDGE CLECs DONT HAVE TO GIVE ILECs ACCESS TO RIGHTSOFWAY A federal district judge in Lincoln Neb has ruled that competitive local exchange carriers CLECs arent required to give incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs access to their poles ducts and rightsofway Judge Richard G Kopf made the determination in ATT Communications of the Midwest Inc v U S WEST Communications Inc et al case no CV ATT brought the lawsuit in seeking to overturn the Nebraska Public Service Commissions approval of an interconnection agreement That agreement required ATT to give U S WEST now Qwest Corp reciprocal access to poles ducts and rightsofway Consideration of the lawsuit was delayed by judicial challenges to the FCCs landmark order on carrier interconnection Judge Kopf was faced with a split among federal courts on how to handle an apparent contradiction in the Communications Act of as amended by the Telecommunications Act of Section of the Act appears to require all local exchange carriers LECs whether ILECs or CLECs to grant access to their rightsofway the judge said But section seems to require that all LECs grant access only to competitive not incumbent local exchange carriers he said The FCC had based its regulations on section and most federal district courts had deferred to that interpretation Judge Kopf said But the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit San Francisco has said it doubts the soundness of the FCCs interpretation of section Judge Kopf however followed the other district courts and deferred to the FCCs interpretation He concluded that in light of the Acts purpose which is to promote competition the FCCs interpretation that no ILEC may seek access to the facilities or rightsofway of a LEC or any utility under either section of section is based on a permissible construction of the statutes and does not conflict with the plain meaning of the Act Judge Kopf ruled that the reciprocalaccess portion of the companies interconnection agreement violated the Act and the FCCs rules He enjoined Qwest from enforcing that portion of the agreement FCC PROPOSES CHANGING USF CONTRIBUTION SYSTEM The FCC has proposed streamlining and simplifying the way it collects Universal Service Fund USF contributions The proposals which include limiting how carriers recover contributions from their customers and using a flatrate assessment are aimed at dealing with recent changes and developing trends in the industry The FCC recently tweaked the USF contribution system to reduce the lag time between accrual of revenues and payment of contributions based on those revenues TR March At that time it said it soon would consider more fundamental modifica tions to the USF contribution mechanism The USF supports affordable service in highcost areas and discounted service for lowincome customers schools libraries and rural health care providers USF contributions currently are assessed as a percentage of carriers interstate and international enduser telecom service revenues The percentage is based on revenues as of six months before the contributions are collected The FCC allows carriers to decide for themselves whether and how to recover contribution costs from their customers In a statement today the FCC said the following industry trends affect USF contributions the entrance of new companies such as the Bells into certain long distance markets growth in the wireless telecom sector to the extent that wireless carriers interstate revenues may exceed the FCCs interim safe harbor threshold for contributions and increased bundling of services making it difficult to distinguish interstate from intrastate revenues The FCC is seeking comments on whether it should require carriers to contribute a percentage of their collected revenues rather than a percentage of their billed revenues to the USF It wants to know whether it should assess contributions based on current or projected revenues The Commission also asks whether it should use a flat assessment such as a fixed perline charge if it should require that carriers give customers a uniform description of contribution recovery charges and whether those charges should be limited to the amount of the contribution assessment FCCs WIRELESS BUREAU SIDES WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES ON E COSTS The FCCs Wireless Telecommunications Bureau has sided with public safety agencies in a dispute over who should bear more of the financial burden for installing Phase I enhanced E systems In a May letter to the King County Wash E Program bureau Chief Thomas J Sugrue clarified that the selective router maintained by incumbent local exchange carriers is the proper demarcation point for allocating E implementation costs between wireless carriers and public safety answering points PSAPs The bureaus determination supports the view held by PSAPs Carriers on the other hand had maintained that PSAPs should be responsible for E network components or upgrades beginning at carriers switches The bureau sought comments on the issue last year in response to King Countys request for a clarification of the FCCs position TR Aug and Sept In the letter Mr Sugrue stressed that the agency continues to favor negotiation between the parties as the most efficacious and efficient means for resolving disputes regarding cost allocations for implementing Phase I But PSAPs still will have to bear some costs he said including upgrades to the selective router trunking equipment and other hardware and software STUDY SAYS MOBILE PHONE USE PLAYS LITTLE ROLE IN ACCIDENTS Mobile phones are responsible for distracting drivers in only a small percentage of vehicle accidents according to an analysis of accident data released today The University of North Carolinas Highway Safety Research Center compiled the study for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety using data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations Crashworthiness Data System The data were collected from to on vehicles involved in crashes in which at least one vehicle was towed from the scene Results were weighted to calculate national estimates In crashes where driver distraction was a factor of the time that distraction was something outside the drivers vehicle the study found Drivers attempts to adjust car radios was a factor in of collisions involving driver distraction and passengers were a factor in of those crashes the study said Mobile phones were number eight on the list of driver distractions Use of wireless phones preceded of crashes where driver distraction was a factor the study said The margin of error for each category varied from to for mobile phone use it was Jane Stutts manager of epidemiological studies at the UNC center and the studys author told TR that the mobile phone results were surprising just because people assume that cell phones cause a lot of crashes But she stressed that many drivers may be reluctant to tell police that they were distracted by using a phone They may try to hide it she said The estimates for mobile phone use were based on only reported cases Ms Stutts also noted that the driver distraction was listed as unknown for almost of the cases studied She said this fact highlights the need for improved collection of accident data CABLEVISION WONT HELP ATT SELL B CABLEVISION STAKE Cablevision Systems Corp executives today said they dont intend to help ATT Corp sell billion in Cablevision shares ATT had asked Cablevision a cable TV system operator based in Bethpage NY to register the million shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission allowing for a public sale TR April Cablevision has notified ATT that we will not proceed at this time with the registration of their shares of Cablevision common stock said William Bell Cablevisions vice chairman Instead Cablevision is considering its own public stock sale to raise funds to improve its cable TV networks he said during a conference call with investors and analysts Cablevisions decision may complicate ATTs efforts to sell the shares which it inherited in the takeover of Tele Communications Inc ATT wants to sell the stake to raise funds for debt reduction and to thin its cable TV holdings The FCCs rules regarding cable TV ownership are in limbo after being vacated by the US Court of Appeals in Washington But ATT has been maneuvering to sell some cable TV holdings in preparation for the enactment of new rules ATT still can sell the Cablevision shares Mr Bell said ATT has piggyback registration rights that entitle it under certain conditions to add its shares to Cablevisions public stock offerings according to SEC documents ATT may or may not be able to exercise some piggyback rights Mr Bell said It really will depend on market conditions and what Cablevisions needs are FCC SEEKS EXTRA M FOR ENGINEERING PROGRAM The FCC is asking congressional appropriators to earmark an additional million for its fiscal year budget The funds would help pay for a new Excellence in Engineering training and recruitment program President Bush has proposed million for the FCC for FY an increase over the Commissions current appropriation level TR April In a letter to Sen Conrad Burns R Mont FCC Chairman Michael K Powell says the extra money would be used for recruitment incentives educational initiatives for advanced and nonengineers at the FCC and upgrading the agencys technical equipment The overarching goal of the program is to ensure that the Commission maintains a high level of technical expertise so that it is at least as fluent in technology and engineering issues as are the entities it regulates Mr Powell said in the May letter Mr Powells letter included draft legislation that would allow the FCC to establish salaries for engineers and other technical and professional hires that are more competitive with the private sector The proposal also authorizes each Commissioner to hire a professional engineering assistant in addition to the three professional assistants they currently are allowed A Burns spokeswoman said the lawmaker was working with Mr Powell to submit the budget request Sen Burns is chairman of the

gives a pretty good foot view of telecom policy considerations Original Message From Paul Jackson mailto Sent Friday February PM To Subject powellinterns Gilder Letter to Chairman Powell Confidential The Wall Street Journal Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Friday February The Broadband Economy Needs a Hero By George Gilder and Bret Swanson Dear Mr Powell Whether you know it or not your leadership and decisions over the next four years will have more impact on the economy than those of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan Surely our stockmarket swoon of and stagnating economic growth in are partly due to the Feds inexplicable liquidity leash combined with the highest tax burden since World War II But the chief threats to the st century economy are the politicians bureaucrats and Silicon Valley knownothings responsible for Americas broadband connectivity crisis We owe Les Vadasz of Intel an apology for making fun of his prediction that narrowband links would prevail into the st century The Internet as we know it is about seven years old yet fewer than million of million American homes enjoy broadband and its wealth of social commercial and educational opportunities Contrary to popular belief the chief obstacle to progress is not entrenched Bell operating companies but a regulatory regime that presumes to level the playing field equalize access and promote competition The only result of these policies has been the effective nationalization and paralysis of broadband The Telecommunications Act ruled that in exchange for the right to enter the longdistance telephone business the Bells must open their residential copper lines to competitors as well as allow these competitors to locate equipment in Bell central offices and offer digital subscriber line DSL services over Bellowned copper In November the FCC issued a further decree forcing the Bells to stop dragging their feet and cooperate The FCC actions spawned a new category of startups known as broadband competitive local exchange carriers CLECs which planned to compete with the Bells Funded by billions of dollars in Silicon Valley venture capital and public offerings companies like Rhythms Northpoint Covad and Jato earned praise from libertarians in both Washington and Palo Alto Calif Northpoint even had freedomloving former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt on its board But despite all good intentions these were not hightech startups They became venture capitalfunded lobbying and litigation shops intent on forcing the Bells to share their copper With more press releases on new lawsuits than on new subscribers one of the companies epitomized the strategy Rhythms continues successful regulatory litigation The result of all this lawyering The CLECs won everything Access to copper wherever they sued Multimillion dollar awards from the Bells And bankruptcy Bankruptcy Late last year Northpoint filed for Chapter after Verizon withdrew an million investment Jato closed its doors Rhythms cut its staff by Covad is slashing jobs and closing central offices Of Covads lines in service are not recognizing revenue And all of this is happening in the face of massive consumer demand for broadband services The problem is that DSL is risky and hard Some studies have reported that of DSL hookups fail on the first try Even amicable relationships between CLECs and Bells are a software nightmare with a different billing and provisioning system for each service provider Such difficulties render DSL not a matter of will and politics but of technical and entrepreneurial risks Companies are forced to invest heavily in research and engineering personnel but have few opportunities for outsized rewards Thats because Congress and the FCC set up an awkward scheme in which everyone got a piece of the action but no one could make any money Often barred from carrying signals across longdistance boundaries the Bells hand off traffic to other longdistance carriers CLECs rent lines from the Bells And Internet service providers end up doing costly customer service and marketing to get people signed up in the first place In short as many as four parties routinely battle for low or negativemargin chunks of monthly bills By summoning new competition and then mandating the rivals cooperate in open access the government effectively privatized the risks and socialized the profits By December the Bells had signed up million users and the CLECs combining for just million DSL subscribers among the million or so copperconnected US homes and businesses Cable modems with million subscribers at yearend have done better but AOL Time Warner and ATT Americas two cable behemoths are bogged down by the same openaccess nonsense that plagues DSL Over the past two years ATT CEO Michael Armstrong acquired billion in cable assets while watching his companys billion market capitalization plummet to billion Just last month the Federal Trade Commission ruled that AOL Time Warner must offer at least one nonaffiliated cable broadband ISP Internet Service Provider service on Time Warners cable system before AOL itself begins offering service followed by two other nonaffiliated ISPs within days and a requirement to negotiate in good faith with others after that The nations secondlargest ISP EarthLink will now get access to AOLs expensive cables pretty much for free This regulatory morass treats the most dynamic technically creative and transformative industry in the world economy as if it were some static commodity market for corn or pork bellies Mr Chairman in a recent speech you made the key point that innovation is more important than price competition When it comes to leadingedge services and technologies narrow price competition is almost meaningless Internet innovation means qualitative change orderofmagnitude price reductions and constantly changing services that always constitute monopolies when first launched No Internet advantage can last more than a couple of years In and over million kilometers of optical fiber were laid worldwide enough to stretch to the sun Hundreds of billions of dollars have already been invested by metropolitan fiberoptic network builders Metromedia Fiber Level Communications optical hardware companies Avanex ONI Sorrento and optical service providers Yipes Cogent Sphera These companies are already rendering the metropolitan DSL debate moot with thousandfold increases in price performance over existing technology Similar breakthroughs are on the way in residential wireless But none of these deployments including fiber to the home can flourish under a regime of forced sharing of entrepreneurial assets and profits In this environment let the Bells compete in longdistance and extort any temporary profits they can from their local copper cages Let the cable companies capitalize on their advantage for the few years it will last Allow the infinite spectrum of air and fiber to be exploited in any way its owners wish Then sit back and nostalgically recall those early days of the Internet when we naively thought a economic growth rate was really something The broadband economy needs a hero

COMP COULD GET WORSE onlinetrdtdTdhtm NEWS IN BRIEF onlinetrdtdTdhtm FRUSTRATED JUDGES FOCUS ON BACKGROUND IN AVERAGE SCHEDULE CASE Appeals court judges today vented their exasperation at the inability of attorneys to explain how universal service support for each small average schedule company is determined The attorney representing the FCC bore the brunt of the judges frustrations and at times caustic comments on that issue But on the legal issues the lawyer representing the National Exchange Carrier Association Inc in its challenge to an FCC decision seemed to take the harder hits The US Court of Appeals in Washington must decide whether the FCC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in prescribing a increase in average schedule universal service support Average schedule companies use formulas derived by NECA and approved by the FCC to approximate their perloop costs of providing service This is in contrast to socalled cost companies which perform studies to calculate their actual perloop costs The case marks the first time that NECA which the FCC has charged with updating the formula used by average schedule companies to calculate universal service support has asked the court to review an FCC order NECA attorney Richard A Askoff pointed out during oral arguments this morning The judges spent as much time seeking information on how the average schedule mechanism works as they did questioning attorneys about their legal arguments Judge David S Tatel asked for clarification of how the average schedule formula was applied to individual companies After FCC attorney Laurel Bergold spent nearly all her allotted time in an unsuccessful attempt to clarify that aspect of the case Chief Judge Harry T Edwards commented We get hard things from the FCC but this case is bizarre Mr Askoff apparently cleared up the matter for the judges during his rebuttal arguments He explained that certain data such as the number of loops per exchange is plugged into the average schedule formula to determine a given carriers amount of support But Mr Askoff faced some tough questions from Judge Douglas H Ginsburg regarding NECAs argument that it hadnt received proper notice of the FCCs intention to prescribe the adjustment Judge Ginsburg wondered what NECA would have said to the FCC if it had received notice that it didnt say in advocating a increase in universal service support for average schedule carriers Mr Askoff said NECA would have discussed the fallacy of the FCCs belief that universal service support should be tied to growth in the number of local loops Judge Edwards replied that NECA already had made that argument before the FCC The case National Exchange Carrier Association Inc v FCC no stems from an FCC decision to reject NECAs proposed average schedule universal service formula for CLECs WANT RECORD ON PACIFIC BELL InterLATA SERVICE BID REFRESHED The California Office of Ratepayer Advocates several trade associations representing competitive local exchange carriers CLECs and nine individual CLECs have asked the state Public Utilities Commission to refresh its record on Pacific Bells compliance with federally mandated marketopening standards before deciding whether the telco has met those standards In a joint petition filed Friday Feb they argued that the record in th e proceeding was too stale for the commission to reach credible conclusions about Pacific Bells compliance with the marketopening mandates by May the date the commission is scheduled to issue a final decision Compliance with a point competitive checklist of marketopening moves outlined in section of the federal Telecommunications Act of is a prerequisite to Bell companies receiving FCC authorization to provide inregion interLATA local access and transport area service The FCC is required to consult with relevant state commissions and the Justice Department before ruling on a Bell companys section application Bell companies typically try to convince the state regulators of their compliance before submitting an application to the FCC The joint petitioners told the California commission that the record in the proceeding could be supplemented in a relatively prompt and efficient manner If Pacific Bell intends to include updated or other additional information in its application to be filed with the FCC then it should make thatinformation available to the California commission and the parties to this proceeding now the petitioners said Such action would be consistent with the FCCs goal that the state commission be the principal forum for resolving factual disputes in the first instance rather than require the California commission and the parties to address Pacific Bells showing for the first time after being thrust into an expedited review process before the federal agency in Washington DC In addition to the Office of Ratepayer Advocates the joint petitioners were the California Association of Competitive Telecommunications Companies the Association of Communications Enterprises the Competitive Telecommunications Association ATT Communications of California Inc WorldCom Inc Advanced Telcom Inc XO California Inc Spring Communications Co LP New Edge Network Inc ICG Telecom Group Inc Rhythms Links Inc and Time Warner Telecom of California Inc CONSUMER GROUPS CALL FOR PROCOMPETITIVE FCC ACTION The Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union today issued a report stating that policymakers have failed in their attempt to expand consumer choice in local and broadband services In Lessons from the Telecommunications Act the groups called for increased regulation of large companies that continue to monopolize the cable TV and local telephone industries The report said the Acts failure stems from the fact that the major providers of cable TV and local phone service have chosen to merge rather than compete Most of the local phone service market still belongs to the regional Bell monopolies which thanks to a series of mergers have shrunk from seven companies in into just four today the groups said The report asked lawmakers to promote meaningful competition among local service providers by pressing for adoption of certain marketopening principles nationwide It specifically cites local marketopening moves in New York and Texas In the broadband services market a handful of dominant companies have refused to enter each others markets agreeing instead to merge and swap assets the report says Cable monopolies have saddled consumers with huge rate increases and sought to impose their closed business model on the broadband Internet by making it nearly impossible for outside companies to offer Internet services over the monopolies cable lines the groups stated They asked lawmakers to put an end to abusive cable TV pricing practices require telcos to provide nondiscriminatory access to their highspeed networks enforce media ownership limits that promote diversity and block further consolidation that undermines potential competition MOBILE PHONE INDUSTRY FACES LATEST HEALTHRELATED LAWSUIT The wireless phone industry is facing another lawsuit this one filed on behalf of a yearold Georgia man who says his cellphone caused his brain tumor Its the latest in a growing number of such lawsuits alleging that the industry manufactured and marketed the devices

compensatory and punitive damages but doesnt list an amount The count lawsuit claims that the defendants knew or should have known the phones to be defective unreasonably dangerous and hazardous Spokespersons for the defendants declined to comment on the lawsuit ILECs DISTORTIONS FROM RECIP COMP COULD GET WORSE Incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs say their reciprocal compensation payments to competitive local exchange carriers CLECs are continuing to increase making it even more imperative that the FCC change its rules regarding the payments between carriers for terminating local traffic The ILECs told the FCC that declining network costs and increasing traffic flows are producing ever greater economic inefficiencies and distortions Robert T Blau vice presidentexecutive and federal regulatory affairs at BellSouth Corp addressed the issue in a Feb letter to Common Carrier Bureau Chief Dorothy Attwood He wrote on behalf of BellSouth SBC Communications Inc Verizon Communications Inc and Qwest Communications International Inc Mr Blau acknowledged that reciprocal compensation rates are declining but he said dialup traffic to the Internet is increasing faster Most observers project that dialup access minutes will continue to grow rapidly for at least the next three years Mr Blau said In addition changes in technology and capital cost reductions are offsetting reciprocal compensation declines he said Mr Blau estimated that the cost to CLECs of carrying dialup calls to Internet service providers ISPs works out to about per minute or about to of current reciprocal compensation rates He said eliminating reciprocal compensation in favor of a billandkeep system would not force CLECs to raise perline fees for ISP customers NEWS IN BRIEF Former National

telecom and Internetrelated legislation is being promised by Senate communications subcommittee Chairman Conrad Burns R Mont Sen Burns who dubbed his hightech agenda for the previous Congress the Digital Dozen plans to unveil a package of telecom and Internet bills next week that will be called The Tech Seven this time around A spokesman said Sen Burns agenda will include a few holdover bills that didnt make it through the th Congress as well as some surprises They include proposals to expand deployment of broadband services using lowpower TV spectrum to ease reporting requirements for small incumbent local exchange carriers and to lift the caps on universal service support the spokesman said The other top priorities on Sen Burns agenda are bills to bolster online privacy and to curb spamming Sen Burns also may address the process by which the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN selects Internet domain name suffixes through legislation or through the subcommittees oversight capacity the spokesman said Member assignments for the Senate communications subcommittee are expected to be announced later this week Sources say Republican freshmen George Allen Va and John Ensign Nev share the inside track for the panels vacant GOP spots while Democrat John R Edwards NC is considered a lock to fill one of the Democratic seats Meanwhile efforts to organize the House telecommunications subcommittee have bogged down in a debate over whether to add seats to the full House Energy and Commerce Committee says committee spokesman Ken Johnson Theres still a possibility that additional members will be added to the Commerce Committee he told TR Late today Mr Johnson said Commerce still plans to meet tomorrow Wednesday to vote on subcommittee assignments and to organize for the th Congress BROADBAND SERVICES ONLINE PRIVACY TOP AeAs AGENDA In a report sent to the White House and Congress today the AeA formerly the American Electronics Association recommends that federal policymakers take a handsoff approach to regulating those sectors of the broadband market that are served by multiple providers AeAs competitive markets include residential areas served by cable DSL digital subscriber line and satellite providers AeA calls for more efforts at the federal level to promote competition in sectors such as multitentant buildings where there are bottlenecks to competitive entry And it says the FCC should continue to show regulatory restraint with respect to emerging services given the fact that the market for such services while still nascent is functioning in a competition fashion Briefing reporters in Washington today AeA President and Chief Executive Officer William T Archey said the organizations report reflects the views of AeA member companies that participated in a series of town hall meetings held last year In addition to the telecom items the report urges Congress to extend the current threeyear moratorium on new or nondiscriminatory Internet taxes and permanently ban the taxation of Internet access services It reiterates AeAs preference for federal preemption of state privacy laws TR Jan Wireless

favour of having smaller meetings instead of big cometogethers I thing that meeting should focus on two or three subjects and having smaller teams to work out solutions on specified tasks I also think that we can achieve better time efficiency without losing the learning effect of discussing A second point would be my preference to have you on the screen In particular for those dialling in from abroad it would be helpful in order to better follow the discussion Lastly I wonder whether it would not be useful to have short minutes of every meeting for those who did not succeed in participating
