Polymers Bioterrorism Just How Imminent is the Threat by David Krame r Science and Government Report Alerts In the wake of the events of Sep t its become almost a mantra that terrorists will soon unleash biolog ical weapons against US cities Articles on the subject are appearing on a daily basis in the popular press fueled by revelations that the World Trad e Center and Pentagon hijackers had

Sense Hydrogen by Charles Joslin Sensor Technology Alerts As we move i nto alternative engines such as fuel cells that are fueled with hydrogen w e will need sensors to keep track of whats going on We will want better h ydrogen sensors to monitor performance and detect leaks of this explosive g as from storage tanks Just in time chemists in California and France have come up with a nanowire array that will do this with a minimum of fuss It gives us both extremely small hydrogen sensors and hydrogenactivated switc hes Either way they will take little space will work quickly at room tem perature
