Barton discussion draft says that FERCs hands would be tied and that they would have to approve a proposed RTO as to size and scope if the proposed RTO owns or has operational control over transmission facilities that serve at least MW of load Southerns CEO testified in Congress recently that their load is over I assume the MW minimum would permit the SeTrans proposal to meet the proposed statutory minimum since it is Southern plus a few munis as I understand it Is this correct Who would know how many RTOs there would be if each were just over the MW minimum Response The load served by the transmission facilities in the proposed SeTrans exceeds Mw on a peak basis Specifically the peak loads in Mw recorded for by the members of SeTrans are Southern Co Ala Electric Coop Ga Trans Corp MEAG est City of Dalton NA City of Tallahassee South Mississippi est Jacksonville EA Santee Cooper Total Other conceivable RTOs above the Mw threshold Based on existing control areas or regional markets and coincidence of across those areas a rough grouping of smaller RTOs can be envisioned with transmission facilities capable of serving load in the range specified in Rep Bartons draft Peak load was used as a proxy for capacity of transmission facilities Intellbridge projects that based on the Barton draft a total of RTOs SeTrans and others could be created However the creation of hypothetical RTOs serving Mw of load may result in artificial groupings that would not be validated by commercial arrangements Existing transmission interties and supply contracts necessitate the recognition of a new set of likely RTOs that are based in part on current arrangements Groupings with loads of between Mw and Mw seemed more likely to result It also appears highly unlikely that the PJM Interconnect now with a load exceeding would be subject to change Two utilities in Pennsylvania tied to but not part of PJM were added to form a MidAtlantic RTO Based on existing control areas or regional markets and coincidence of across those areas a rough grouping of smaller RTOs can be envisioned with transmission facilities capable of serving load in the range specified in Rep Bartons draft Peak load was used as a proxy for capacity of transmission facilities Northeast Power Coordinating Council ISO New England and NYISO the US Control Areas within the Northeast Power Coordinating Council NPCC had a coincident summer peak of just fewer than ISO New England itself peaked at MW and NYISO at MW Florida Reliability Coordinating Council The FRCCs all time summer peak was Mw near the Mw threshold Power is frequently exported north from the state when peaks in the Southern Co control area are not coincident with those in Florida NERC forecast FRCCs summer internal peak demand to be Mw Southwest Power Pool The Southwest Power Pool SPP which had at one point discussed the possibility of forming its own RTO rather than merging with Midwest ISO fits neatly into the MW range specified in Rep Bartons draft SPP experienced peak demand of MW during summer Western States Three RTOs The Western Systems Coordinating Council reported peak demand for of MW Three smaller RTOs could likely be carved out of the WSCC Northwest Power Pool NWPP Net internal demand for the Northwest Power Pool reported an annual peak of MW during winter Without Canadian demand with a winter peak of roughly MW the Northwest Power Pool would fall near the MW threshold specified by Bartons draft California The California system experienced a year peak demand of MW during the summer Subtracting Mexican demand puts the figure at just under MW Arizona New Mexico Southern Nevada AZNMSNV and Rocky Mountain Power Area RMPA The remaining reliability areas would not on their own meet Bartons MW threshold AZNMSNV served only MW at its summer peak and RMPA which can vacillates between having a winter and summer peak served MW during summer According to the WSCC forecasts the two regions could see a peak demand near by An alternative though less likely configuration could involve a combination of Southern California with AZNMSNV and RMPA leaving Northern California with NWPP MidContinent Area Power Pool MAPP and MidAmerican Interconnected Network MAIN Separate RTOs Few Changes In the MidContinent Area Power Pool MAPP US systems had a year summer peak of MW Load from Canadian systems brings the peak up to just over MW The MidAmerican Interconnected Network MAIN experienced a summer peak demand of MW which would put it above the threshold Shifting Wisconsins MAIN members Wisconsin Electric Power Wisconsin Public Power and Wisconsin Public Service into the MAPP area reduces put peak load for both MAPP and MAIN to close to the Barton bills Mw mark Those three utilities had a coincident peak of roughly Mw Southeast and Northeast Central States Five RTOs The degree which to the transmission system is tied together east of the Mississippi River necessitates approximately five groupings for RTOs in addition to the NPCC These can best be described as the VirginiaCarolina area now known as the NERC subregion VACAR the MidAtlantic region now PJM a TennesseeKentucky RTO the TVA area is now a NERC subregion and two groupings for the East Central Area Reliability Council North ECAR and Central ECAR To illustrate how complex it is to redraw boundaries when systems are physically connected the approximate load in Mw by utility of these fictional groupings is listed below Other considerations may play a larger role in the creation of RTOs
