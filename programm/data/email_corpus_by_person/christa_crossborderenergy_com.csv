Promising Revisions to the Regulatory and Market Structure I Governing Californias Natural Gas Industry and to Report to the California Legislature on the Commissions Findings REBUTTAL TESTIMONY OF R THOMAS BEACH ON BEHALF OF INDICATED ELECTRIC GENERATORS IN SUPPORT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT My name is R Thomas Beach I am principal consultant with the firm Crossborder Energy My business address is Ninth Street Suite Berkeley California My experience and qualifications are described in Attachment RTB to the dire ct testimony that I served in this proceeding on May I INTRODUCTION This rebuttal testimony responds to the direct testimony of the Southe rn California Generation Coalition SCGC and The Utility Reform Network TURN in suppor t of their Post Interim Settlement Agreement PISA which was submitted to the Commission on April The sponsors of this rebuttal testimony include past present and future electric generation customers of the Southern California Gas Company SoCalGas and San Diego G as and Electric SDGE The sponsors of this testimony are all signatories to and supporters of the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement that over parties filed on April For the reasons set forth below the sponsors of this testimony do not support the SCGC TURN PISA to the extent that it fails to unbundle intrastate transmission a step tha t is one of the most promising options that the Commission has identified for the restructuring of the SoCalGas system I recommend instead that the Commission adopt the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement which moves forward on all of the Commissions most promising options including unbundling intrastate transmission The Comprehensive Settlement Agreement enjoys broad support from the full range of stakeholder interests in the southern California gas market II SCGC TURN EXAGGERATE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PGE AND SOCALGAS SYSTEMS In D at page the Commission identified the creation of a system of firm tradeable intrastate transmission rights as one of its most promising options for the further restructuring of the SoCalGas system A significant element in that determination was the Commissions desire to follow the model of the PGE Gas Accord and thus to encourage statewide consistency in its gas restructuring program The SCGC TURN PI SA now asks the Commission to reconsider that finding and to defer any further unbundling of intrastate transmission service on the SoCalGas system In support of that aspect of the PISA the witnesses for SCGC TURN testify that the unbundled transmission syste m adopted for PGE under the Gas Accord responded to a unique set of problems that have n ot been present in southern California that there are significant structural and operational differences between the PGE and SoCalGas systems and that the Gas Accord structure has no t benefitted end use customers in northern California None of these assertions are correct A The Commission Should Focus on a Statewide Consistent Structure for the Gas Utilities Moving Forward Not on Whether PGE and SoCalGas Ha ve Had Similar Problems in the Past SCGC TURN witness Mr Florio describes at length the problems that l ed to the adoption on transmission unbundling for PGE in the Gas Accord settlement He views PGEs difficulties as far more extensive than those that SoCalGas now faces thus justifying more extreme measures such as the unbundling of intrastate transmission SCGC TURN Testimony at Section In my view both PGE and SoCalGas have faced the same types of problems even if the economic distortions on the PGE system have been greater On both systems shippers have not had a system of firm capacity rights allocated by nondiscriminatory open access procedures to govern who had access to what receipt point On the PGE system the attem pt to discriminate against PGT Expansion volumes that sought to use PGEs Line resulted i n the crossover problems at Malin Similarly SoCalGas windowing procedures have not provided firm non discriminatory access at SoCalGas receipt points Windowing has restricted the access of competitive gas supplies to receipt points such as Wheeler Ridge just as t he crossover ban limited the competition to sell gas at Malin onto PGEs Line Furthermore SoCalGas has also faced the same sort of conflict of interest charges as PGE SoCalGas core procurement department has been criticized for monopolizing the Hector Road receipt point to the benefit of SoCalGas shareholders through the Ga s Cost Incentive Mechanism See D at pages However the Commission should not decide the future structure for Californias gas industry on the basis of whether SoCalGas past problems have resembled PGEs past difficulties For electric generators what is important is that the structures that the Commission adopts in both parts of the state should solve these problems and should be consistent on a statewide basis The new electric market is a statewide market There are already at least two merchant electric generators Dynegy and Duke and a number of QF projects under common ownership that operate in more than one gas utility service territory Another merchant plant developer Calpine has made no secret of its intent to operate plants statewide This trend promises to increase competition in the electric market To encourage this trend the Commission should focus on carrying through on D s promise to increase the statewide consistency of Californias natural gas restructuring program The unbundling of intrastate transmission was a key element of the PGE Gas Accord and should be a foundation of the furth er restructuring of the SoCalGas system as well B SoCalGas Backbone System Serves the Same Function as PGEs and Can Be Unbundled in a Manner Similar to the PGE Gas Accord Mr Florio claims that the network nature of the SoCalGas system argues against following the Gas Accord model for unbundling backbone transmission service for SoCalGas Yet Mr Florio concedes that SoCalGas mainline facilities that extend from the Los Angeles basin to the interstate pipelines on the California Arizona border do resemble interstate pipelines SCGC TURN at Section SoCalGas lines running north from the LA Basin to the Wheeler Ridge interconnects also are clearly backbone facilities similar to PGEs With respect to local transmission SoCalGas network of local transmission lines inside the LA Basin is similar to PGEs network of local transmission lines in its load centers i n the Bay Area and Central Valley Indeed both the PGE and SoCalGas systems can be consider ed to be spokes of backbone lines transporting gas from the interstate pipeline receipt points to hubs of networked local transmission facilities The two systems differ in the length and number of the spokes SoCalGas are shorter and more numerous but operationally these components serve the same function In my view there is just as strong an operational basi s for unbundling SoCalGas backbone and local transmission facilities and services as there was for unbundling PGEs C The Benefits of the Gas Accords CityGate Market Have Been Substantial for Electric Generators Mr Weil downplays the benefits that the Gas Accord has produced throu gh competition among suppliers in the PGE citygate market that the Gas Accord created First he appears to cite the existing data as showing average benefits of around cents or mo re per MMcfd SCGC TURN at Section As cited in my direct testimony the actual benefits have been more than cents per mmcfd to per Dth Mr Weil opines tha t such savings are not significant for core customers Ibid at Section Regardless of whether one agrees with him such competitive reductions in transportation costs are very important for electric generators whose total transportation rate is likely to be roughly p er Dth and who as Ms Yap states sell into a highly competitive PX market SCGC TURN at Section For an electric generator a to reduction in gas transportation charges is well worth pursuing as shown by SCGCs active participation on SoCalGas BCAP issues that would low er SoCalGas EG rates by far smaller amounts D Customers Have Not Had to Hold Capacity or Pay Demand Charges to Realize These Benefits Mr Weil also asserts that the fact that relatively few end use customers hold backbone transmission capacity on the PGE system shows that unbundling under the Ga s Accord has not benefitted customers He opines that this is due to the high transaction costs associated with holding capacity SCGC TURN at Section Ms Yap also describes at length how the transaction costs associated with managing transmission capacity tends to force end users to buy from marketers Ibid Section She concludes that unbundling has be en great for marketers but not good for customers Ibid at Section This testimony ignores the fact that marketers do not exist independen t of their customers If a marketers services do not add value for the customer then that marketer will not remain in business for long Under the Gas Accord most noncore end users in northern California have been buying gas from marketers in the PGE citygate market However the available data on PGE citygate gas prices discussed above show that end users have realized significant savings from these purchases compared to the option of buying gas at the California border and managing their own transportation to the citygate These citygate purchases have not involved paying demand charges or incurring transaction costs associated with managi ng capacity Competition among marketers has assured that customers benefit from marketers efficiencies in managing transportation costs III SCGCS AND TURNS COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF TRANSMISSION UNBUNDLING IGNORES THE BENEFITS AND OVERSTATES THE COSTS SCGC and TURN attempt to present a cost benefit analysis of transmission unbundling largely through the testimony of Ms Yap in an effort to show that the cos ts outweigh the benefits Ms Yap ignores several significant benefits from unbundling greatly exaggerates the possible costs and presents unsubstantiated assertions about the impacts o f unbundling on generators in the Los Angeles basin A SCGC TURN Fail to Recognize the Benefits of Transmission Unbundling Unbundling will provide competitive benefits in the citygat e market The experience with transmission unbundling under the PGE Gas Accord has demonstrated that end use customers realize competitive benefits from the creation of a citygate market The citygate market moves gastogas competition between supplier s closer to the customer and allows the customer to avoid risks associated with paying demand charges or managing backbone transportation Those customers who believe they can achieve greater profits by managing their own transportation have that option and since not all transportation rights on the PGE system are held by marketers it is obvious that such customers do exist Mr Weil doubts that the citygate benefits seen on the PGE system wi ll materialize due to Southwest supply dominance at SoCalGas receipt points SCGC TURN a t Section Presumably this refers to the fact that gas prices tend to trade within a narrow range of a few cents per Dth at all of the receipt points into the SoCalGas system Ibid at Section The price differentials at the SoCalGas receipt points are much lower than the significant price differentials that have existed between Topock Arizona and Malin Oregon the two major receipt points into the PGE system However recently the Malin Topock price difference has been due almost entirely to the to per Dth transportation rate differential between PGEs Redwood and Baja paths Over the most recent year for which data is available Malin prices have been essentially equivalent to Topock prices when adjusted for the downstream transportation rate differences This integration of the Malin and Topock markets has been the result of rising Canadian prices relative to US markets which has produc ed a competitive equilibrium between Canadian and domestic supplies serving northern California Yet over this year the benefits of PGE citygate purchases has actually increased even though there was very little difference between Malin and Topock prices delivered to the end user From May through April PGE citygate prices have been per Dth to per Dth lower than the comparable cost of border purchases plus PGEs full backbone transportation rates This data is summarized in my Table Contrary to the SCGC TURN testimony this recent experience suggests that the price benefits from competition at a new SoCalGas citygate may be just as large as those actually observed on the PGE system Table Natural Gas Market

Benefits of Citygate overBorder Purchases Firm AsAvailable Data Source Natural Gas Intelligence The Comprehensive Settlement reduces rates for EG customers Transmission unbundling as proposed in the Comprehensive Settlement will result in a modest reduction in transportation rates for electric generators My direc t testimony discussed how transmission unbundling under the Comprehensive Settlement will reduce EG rates by million per year in or about per Dth compared to the SoCalGas rates adopted in the recent BCAP decision D In addition the Comprehensive Settlement unbundles transmission rates on an embedded cost basis removing roughly half of the EG rate from SoCalGas complex contentious longrun marginal cost rate design This wi ll enhance the certainty and stability of SoCalGas EG rate a particularly important factor to EG customers that may seek to build new gasfired capacity on the SoCalGas system The Comprehensive Settlement reduces risks for EG customers Ms Yap comments at length on how if a generators fundamental risk increases investors demand more net income from the operation to compensate them for that increased level of risk SCGC TURN at Section In my view the Comprehensive Settlement reduces a number of important risks for electric generators compared to the SCGC TURN PIS A as follows F SoCalGas shareholders will assume risk for the recovery o f unbundled backbone transmission costs This protects electric generation customers from bearing higher backbone transmission costs if SoCalGas discounts backbone rates or if declining throughput leads to reduced backbone transmission revenues F The Comprehensive Settlement prices transmission services on a n embedded cost basis through August This removes the calculation and allocatio n of marginal transmission costs as an issue in the next SoCalGas BCAP case F The Comprehensive Settlement uses a defined load factor to price backbone transmission service through the term of the settlement This removes the risk that declining throughput on the SoCalGas system could raise backbone transmissi on rates in the next SoCalGas BCAP case F The Comprehensive Settlement reduces customers risk for reven ues from unbundled storage services to in the second year beginning in April while the SCGC TURN PISA maintains the risk adopted in D through F The Comprehensive Settlement unbundles SoCalGas transmission storage and balancing services This will offer electric generators a number of new opportunities to reduce their costs including citygate gas purchases selfbalancing or competitive balancing services and new competitive storage services In my opinion these opportunities reduce the risk that generators in the Los Angeles Basin will be caught in a price squeeze between their gas costs and their electric revenues because they will have more ways in which to reduce their gas costs B SCGC TURN Greatly Overstate the Impact of Demand Charges The use of demand charges for backbone transmission service appea rs to be the focal point of SCGC TURNs opposition to transmission unbundling Throughout their testimony SCGC TURN overstate the impact of demand charges F Ms Yaps Figure showing the impact of a customers load fa ctor on its average transportation rate assumes that the customers entire rate is collected in a demand charge SCGC TURN at Section She fails to note that the demand charge for firm backbone transmission under the Comprehensive Settlement will be only abou t of the total EG rate under the SFV rate option and just of the rate under th e alternative backbone rate with a demand component F Ms Yap presents the results of a study of more than half of the generators in the Los Angeles basin that purports to show that SFVstyle demand charges could increase annual fixed costs by as much as percent SCGC TURN at Section I have examined the workpapers for this study obtained in by Southern California Edison in discovery and it is based on wholly unrealistic assumptions for how generators will buy gas under the Comprehensive Settlement First the study assumes tha t each generator will contract at the SFV rate proposed in the Comprehensive Settlement for a quantity of firm backbone capacity based on the generators theoretical maximum ga s use in a day that is its generating capacity in MW times its average heat rate times hours Apparently this assumption is made regardless of whether the plant has actually ever used that much gas in a single day The plants studied are mostly intermediateload or peaking units and almost certainly never operate at anything approaching full capacity for all hours of a day As a result of this assumption the plants studied are assumed to contract for MDth per day of backbone capacity According to the study these units represent ie less than one half of the gasfired capacity in the Los Angeles Basin If all generators in the basin contracted for capacity in this way electric generators alone would demand MDth per day of capacity or of SoCalGas total receipt point capacity There is obviously no such demand today for firm service to electric generators on the SoCalGas system Second the study assumes that the generators will make no effort to broker release or sell the massive amount of excess capacity that they have bought and will derive no revenues from such offpeak capacity sales Thus the studys dire picture of the impact of demand charges on lowload factor generators assumes that such generators massively overcontract for capacity and fail to take advantage of the numerous means available under the Comprehensive Settlement to reduce or eliminate their demand charge risks The Comprehensive Settlement offers an optional backbone rate wit h a demand charge that almost halves the demand charge risk but offers the same firm priority as the SFV demand charge Under the comprehensive settlement interruptible service at volumetric rates is always available at no more than a premium over firm backbone rates and may even be available at less than the firm backbone rates particularly duri ng lowdemand periods With a backbone rate of per Dth this premium is no more than per Dth Ms Yap observes in Section that the interstate pipelines supplying SoCalGas have at least MMcfd or more capacity than SoCalGas intrastate system She does not recognize that SoCalGas backbone system also has more than MMcfd of excess capacity plus substantial excess storage capacity Due t o this excess intrastate capacity it is difficult to imagine a scenario for the foreseeable future in which a low load factor generator would ever have to pay more than the maximu m interruptible rate for virtually firm backbone service I have recalculated the results of the SCGC TURN study under the assumption that generators in the Los Angeles basin take interruptible service i n order to avoid demand charges at the full per Dth premium for interruptible service In this case the generators annual fixed costs increase by just sixtenths of one percent In reality I expect that interruptible or released firm service wil l be available for much of the year at allvolumetric rates that are much less than the maximum interruptible rate The Comprehensive Settlement will establish an active market for the trading of backbone capacity on the SoCalGas system This will provide a means for electric generators to rationalize their holdings of intrastate capacity and may be a source of firm capacity at volumetric rates Again the SCGC TURN study of th e impact of demand charges assumes that generators do not use this secondary market Ms Yap fails to recognize that lowload factor generators will b e able to avoid paying demand charges and save money on intrastate transportation as well by buying gas in the citygate market Ms Yaps primary concern with the cityga te market appears to be the fear that marketers will be able to charge a significant premium for citygate sales during periods of capacity constraints SCGC TURN at Section Ms Yaps testimony fails to explain her assertion that the citygate marke t could become a bottleneck on the SoCalGas system Upstream of the citygate market SoCalGas will have over MMcfd of excess backbone capacity plus significan t amounts of unused storage capacity Ms Yaps bottlenecks and marketermanipulated high prices have not materialized in two years of experience with the PGE citygate market even though PGE has less excess transmission capacity and far less storage capacity than SoCalGas PGE city gate prices did experience one brief spike due to very high dema nd during the cold snap just prior to Christmas in but on average PGE citygate prices have provided significant benefits to end users compared to purchases at the California border In addition the data that Mr Weil cites on the parties holding capacity on the PGE system shows that parties hold capacity on the Redwood path alone an d does not suggest any undue concentration of capacity holdings on the PGE backbone system Ibid Table Section Furthermore the Comprehensive Settlement has numerous provisions to ensure that any one marketer will be unlikely to accumulate a dominant share of capacity to the SoCalGas citygate market First noncore end use customers will have the initial two open seasons in which to subscribe to up to of the available backbone capacity without competition from marketers This should ensure that end users th at are interested in holding capacity will be able to acquire the capacity that they desire and is likely to lead to an even greater number of holders of capacity than resulted fr om the Gas Accord open season in which end users and marketers competed together Second the Comprehensive Settlement limits any one party from holding at the end of the open season process more than of the intrastate capacity from any individual SoCalGas receipt point Third if any party attempts to withhold firm intrastate capacity in an effort to drive up prices that capacity will be available for SoCalGas to sell as interruptible service and SoCalGas will have a strong incentive to market such capacity because it is at risk for the recovery of backbone transmission costs The SCGC TURN testimony tries to portray lowload factor generators as caught in a price squeeze between capped PX prices and increased fixed operating cost s due to the imposition of demand charges for intrastate transmission SCGC TURN Section The testimony paints a grim picture of plants closing and jobs lost in the Lo s Angeles Basin However there are a number of elements in this picture that simply do not add up F The testimony appears to assume that lowload factor generators pay the SFV demand charges and take none of the steps discussed above to mitigate or eliminate the impact of demand charges F The testimony does not recognize that there will be a million do llar reduction in rates to the EG class as a result of the Comprehensive Settlement F The testimony asserts that the increases in operating costs as a re sult of demand charges will be serious enough to force plants to close Even accepting SCGC TURNs inflated figure of a increase in fixed costs SCGC TURN provide no financial dat a that substantiates their assertion that an increase of this magnitude is likely to force a significant number of plants to close F SCGC TURN fail to appreciate the logical way to avoid the price squeeze that they so fear buy gas in the SoCalGas citygate market Citygate buyers will avoid paying demand charges so their fixed operating costs will not increase In additio n the SoCalGas citygate market is likely to be the gas market that is most tightly linked to electric prices in southern California because it will be the closest market to the generators point of consumption and because almost of noncore loads on the SoCalGas SDGE system are electric generators As a result generators buying gas in the SoCalGas citygate market will have the highest assurance that changes in their gas costs will be reflecte d in changes in electric prices thus reducing the risk of a price squeeze between gas and electric prices This has certainly been the case in northern California Straightforward statistical analyses that I have performed show that the PGE citygate gas price is more highly correlated to PX electric prices than are gas prices in any other market in the state presumabl y because electric generators in northern California use that market and because it is th e closest market to the generators burner tips F SCGC TURN attempt to argue that the closure of lowload factor pl ants in the Los Angeles Basin due to the imposition of demand charges will have serious implications for electric reliability SCGC TURN at Section At the same time SCGC TURN argue that generators will not be able to recover demand charges because les s than of the capacity in the basin is under Reliability MustRun RMR contracts an d that there is intense competition for available RMR contracts Yet the lack of RM R contracts in the basin is due to the fact that there is enough capacity in the basin to provide morethan adequate reliability and to assure that few generators can exercise local market power If some generators in the Los Angeles Basin go out of business due to demand charges a more likely scenario than blackouts is that PX prices will rise in southern California the ISO will make available more RMR contracts in the basin and those contracts wi ll provide a higher level of cost recovery thus offsetting the impact of the demand charg es This completes my rebuttal testimony

Promising Revisions to the Regulatory and Market Structure I Governing Californias Natural Gas Industry and to Report to the California Legislature on the Commissions Findings REBUTTAL TESTIMONY OF R THOMAS BEACH ON BEHALF OF INDICATED ELECTRIC GENERATORS IN SUPPORT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT My name is R Thomas Beach I am principal consultant with the firm Crossborder Energy My business address is Ninth Street Suite Berkeley California My experience and qualifications are described in Attachment RTB to the dire ct testimony that I served in this proceeding on May I INTRODUCTION This rebuttal testimony responds to the direct testimony of the Southe rn California Generation Coalition SCGC and The Utility Reform Network TURN in suppor t of their Post Interim Settlement Agreement PISA which was submitted to the Commission on April The sponsors of this rebuttal testimony include past present and future electric generation customers of the Southern California Gas Company SoCalGas and San Diego G as and Electric SDGE The sponsors of this testimony are all signatories to and supporters of the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement that over parties filed on April For the reasons set forth below the sponsors of this testimony do not support the SCGC TURN PISA to the extent that it fails to unbundle intrastate transmission a step tha t is one of the most promising options that the Commission has identified for the restructuring of the SoCalGas system I recommend instead that the Commission adopt the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement which moves forward on all of the Commissions most promising options including unbundling intrastate transmission The Comprehensive Settlement Agreement enjoys broad support from the full range of stakeholder interests in the southern California gas market II SCGC TURN EXAGGERATE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PGE AND SOCALGAS SYSTEMS In D at page the Commission identified the creation of a system of firm tradeable intrastate transmission rights as one of its most promising options for the further restructuring of the SoCalGas system A significant element in that determination was the Commissions desire to follow the model of the PGE Gas Accord and thus to encourage statewide consistency in its gas restructuring program The SCGC TURN PI SA now asks the Commission to reconsider that finding and to defer any further unbundling of intrastate transmission service on the SoCalGas system In support of that aspect of the PISA the witnesses for SCGC TURN testify that the unbundled transmission syste m adopted for PGE under the Gas Accord responded to a unique set of problems that have n ot been present in southern California that there are significant structural and operational differences between the PGE and SoCalGas systems and that the Gas Accord structure has no t benefitted end use customers in northern California None of these assertions are correct A The Commission Should Focus on a Statewide Consistent Structure for the Gas Utilities Moving Forward Not on Whether PGE and SoCalGas Ha ve Had Similar Problems in the Past SCGC TURN witness Mr Florio describes at length the problems that l ed to the adoption on transmission unbundling for PGE in the Gas Accord settlement He views PGEs difficulties as far more extensive than those that SoCalGas now faces thus justifying more extreme measures such as the unbundling of intrastate transmission SCGC TURN Testimony at Section In my view both PGE and SoCalGas have faced the same types of problems even if the economic distortions on the PGE system have been greater On both systems shippers have not had a system of firm capacity rights allocated by nondiscriminatory open access procedures to govern who had access to what receipt point On the PGE system the attem pt to discriminate against PGT Expansion volumes that sought to use PGEs Line resulted i n the crossover problems at Malin Similarly SoCalGas windowing procedures have not provided firm non discriminatory access at SoCalGas receipt points Windowing has restricted the access of competitive gas supplies to receipt points such as Wheeler Ridge just as t he crossover ban limited the competition to sell gas at Malin onto PGEs Line Furthermore SoCalGas has also faced the same sort of conflict of interest charges as PGE SoCalGas core procurement department has been criticized for monopolizing the Hector Road receipt point to the benefit of SoCalGas shareholders through the Ga s Cost Incentive Mechanism See D at pages However the Commission should not decide the future structure for Californias gas industry on the basis of whether SoCalGas past problems have resembled PGEs past difficulties For electric generators what is important is that the structures that the Commission adopts in both parts of the state should solve these problems and should be consistent on a statewide basis The new electric market is a statewide market There are already at least two merchant electric generators Dynegy and Duke and a number of QF projects under common ownership that operate in more than one gas utility service territory Another merchant plant developer Calpine has made no secret of its intent to operate plants statewide This trend promises to increase competition in the electric market To encourage this trend the Commission should focus on carrying through on D s promise to increase the statewide consistency of Californias natural gas restructuring program The unbundling of intrastate transmission was a key element of the PGE Gas Accord and should be a foundation of the furth er restructuring of the SoCalGas system as well B SoCalGas Backbone System Serves the Same Function as PGEs and Can Be Unbundled in a Manner Similar to the PGE Gas Accord Mr Florio claims that the network nature of the SoCalGas system argues against following the Gas Accord model for unbundling backbone transmission service for SoCalGas Yet Mr Florio concedes that SoCalGas mainline facilities that extend from the Los Angeles basin to the interstate pipelines on the California Arizona border do resemble interstate pipelines SCGC TURN at Section SoCalGas lines running north from the LA Basin to the Wheeler Ridge interconnects also are clearly backbone facilities similar to PGEs With respect to local transmission SoCalGas network of local transmission lines inside the LA Basin is similar to PGEs network of local transmission lines in its load centers i n the Bay Area and Central Valley Indeed both the PGE and SoCalGas systems can be consider ed to be spokes of backbone lines transporting gas from the interstate pipeline receipt points to hubs of networked local transmission facilities The two systems differ in the length and number of the spokes SoCalGas are shorter and more numerous but operationally these components serve the same function In my view there is just as strong an operational basi s for unbundling SoCalGas backbone and local transmission facilities and services as there was for unbundling PGEs C The Benefits of the Gas Accords CityGate Market Have Been Substantial for Electric Generators Mr Weil downplays the benefits that the Gas Accord has produced throu gh competition among suppliers in the PGE citygate market that the Gas Accord created First he appears to cite the existing data as showing average benefits of around cents or mo re per MMcfd SCGC TURN at Section As cited in my direct testimony the actual benefits have been more than cents per mmcfd to per Dth Mr Weil opines tha t such savings are not significant for core customers Ibid at Section Regardless of whether one agrees with him such competitive reductions in transportation costs are very important for electric generators whose total transportation rate is likely to be roughly p er Dth and who as Ms Yap states sell into a highly competitive PX market SCGC TURN at Section For an electric generator a to reduction in gas transportation charges is well worth pursuing as shown by SCGCs active participation on SoCalGas BCAP issues that would low er SoCalGas EG rates by far smaller amounts D Customers Have Not Had to Hold Capacity or Pay Demand Charges to Realize These Benefits Mr Weil also asserts that the fact that relatively few end use customers hold backbone transmission capacity on the PGE system shows that unbundling under the Ga s Accord has not benefitted customers He opines that this is due to the high transaction costs associated with holding capacity SCGC TURN at Section Ms Yap also describes at length how the transaction costs associated with managing transmission capacity tends to force end users to buy from marketers Ibid Section She concludes that unbundling has be en great for marketers but not good for customers Ibid at Section This testimony ignores the fact that marketers do not exist independen t of their customers If a marketers services do not add value for the customer then that marketer will not remain in business for long Under the Gas Accord most noncore end users in northern California have been buying gas from marketers in the PGE citygate market However the available data on PGE citygate gas prices discussed above show that end users have realized significant savings from these purchases compared to the option of buying gas at the California border and managing their own transportation to the citygate These citygate purchases have not involved paying demand charges or incurring transaction costs associated with managi ng capacity Competition among marketers has assured that customers benefit from marketers efficiencies in managing transportation costs III SCGCS AND TURNS COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF TRANSMISSION UNBUNDLING IGNORES THE BENEFITS AND OVERSTATES THE COSTS SCGC and TURN attempt to present a cost benefit analysis of transmission unbundling largely through the testimony of Ms Yap in an effort to show that the cos ts outweigh the benefits Ms Yap ignores several significant benefits from unbundling greatly exaggerates the possible costs and presents unsubstantiated assertions about the impacts o f unbundling on generators in the Los Angeles basin A SCGC TURN Fail to Recognize the Benefits of Transmission Unbundling Unbundling will provide competitive benefits in the citygat e market The experience with transmission unbundling under the PGE Gas Accord has demonstrated that end use customers realize competitive benefits from the creation of a citygate market The citygate market moves gastogas competition between supplier s closer to the customer and allows the customer to avoid risks associated with paying demand charges or managing backbone transportation Those customers who believe they can achieve greater profits by managing their own transportation have that option and since not all transportation rights on the PGE system are held by marketers it is obvious that such customers do exist Mr Weil doubts that the citygate benefits seen on the PGE system wi ll materialize due to Southwest supply dominance at SoCalGas receipt points SCGC TURN a t Section Presumably this refers to the fact that gas prices tend to trade within a narrow range of a few cents per Dth at all of the receipt points into the SoCalGas system Ibid at Section The price differentials at the SoCalGas receipt points are much lower than the significant price differentials that have existed between Topock Arizona and Malin Oregon the two major receipt points into the PGE system However recently the Malin Topock price difference has been due almost entirely to the to per Dth transportation rate differential between PGEs Redwood and Baja paths Over the most recent year for which data is available Malin prices have been essentially equivalent to Topock prices when adjusted for the downstream transportation rate differences This integration of the Malin and Topock markets has been the result of rising Canadian prices relative to US markets which has produc ed a competitive equilibrium between Canadian and domestic supplies serving northern California Yet over this year the benefits of PGE citygate purchases has actually increased even though there was very little difference between Malin and Topock prices delivered to the end user From May through April PGE citygate prices have been per Dth to per Dth lower than the comparable cost of border purchases plus PGEs full backbone transportation rates This data is summarized in my Table Contrary to the SCGC TURN testimony this recent experience suggests that the price benefits from competition at a new SoCalGas citygate may be just as large as those actually observed on the PGE system Table Natural Gas Market

Benefits of Citygate overBorder Purchases Firm AsAvailable Data Source Natural Gas Intelligence The Comprehensive Settlement reduces rates for EG customers Transmission unbundling as proposed in the Comprehensive Settlement will result in a modest reduction in transportation rates for electric generators My direc t testimony discussed how transmission unbundling under the Comprehensive Settlement will reduce EG rates by million per year in or about per Dth compared to the SoCalGas rates adopted in the recent BCAP decision D In addition the Comprehensive Settlement unbundles transmission rates on an embedded cost basis removing roughly half of the EG rate from SoCalGas complex contentious longrun marginal cost rate design This wi ll enhance the certainty and stability of SoCalGas EG rate a particularly important factor to EG customers that may seek to build new gasfired capacity on the SoCalGas system The Comprehensive Settlement reduces risks for EG customers Ms Yap comments at length on how if a generators fundamental risk increases investors demand more net income from the operation to compensate them for that increased level of risk SCGC TURN at Section In my view the Comprehensive Settlement reduces a number of important risks for electric generators compared to the SCGC TURN PIS A as follows F SoCalGas shareholders will assume risk for the recovery o f unbundled backbone transmission costs This protects electric generation customers from bearing higher backbone transmission costs if SoCalGas discounts backbone rates or if declining throughput leads to reduced backbone transmission revenues F The Comprehensive Settlement prices transmission services on a n embedded cost basis through August This removes the calculation and allocatio n of marginal transmission costs as an issue in the next SoCalGas BCAP case F The Comprehensive Settlement uses a defined load factor to price backbone transmission service through the term of the settlement This removes the risk that declining throughput on the SoCalGas system could raise backbone transmissi on rates in the next SoCalGas BCAP case F The Comprehensive Settlement reduces customers risk for reven ues from unbundled storage services to in the second year beginning in April while the SCGC TURN PISA maintains the risk adopted in D through F The Comprehensive Settlement unbundles SoCalGas transmission storage and balancing services This will offer electric generators a number of new opportunities to reduce their costs including citygate gas purchases selfbalancing or competitive balancing services and new competitive storage services In my opinion these opportunities reduce the risk that generators in the Los Angeles Basin will be caught in a price squeeze between their gas costs and their electric revenues because they will have more ways in which to reduce their gas costs B SCGC TURN Greatly Overstate the Impact of Demand Charges The use of demand charges for backbone transmission service appea rs to be the focal point of SCGC TURNs opposition to transmission unbundling Throughout their testimony SCGC TURN overstate the impact of demand charges F Ms Yaps Figure showing the impact of a customers load fa ctor on its average transportation rate assumes that the customers entire rate is collected in a demand charge SCGC TURN at Section She fails to note that the demand charge for firm backbone transmission under the Comprehensive Settlement will be only abou t of the total EG rate under the SFV rate option and just of the rate under th e alternative backbone rate with a demand component F Ms Yap presents the results of a study of more than half of the generators in the Los Angeles basin that purports to show that SFVstyle demand charges could increase annual fixed costs by as much as percent SCGC TURN at Section I have examined the workpapers for this study obtained in by Southern California Edison in discovery and it is based on wholly unrealistic assumptions for how generators will buy gas under the Comprehensive Settlement First the study assumes tha t each generator will contract at the SFV rate proposed in the Comprehensive Settlement for a quantity of firm backbone capacity based on the generators theoretical maximum ga s use in a day that is its generating capacity in MW times its average heat rate times hours Apparently this assumption is made regardless of whether the plant has actually ever used that much gas in a single day The plants studied are mostly intermediateload or peaking units and almost certainly never operate at anything approaching full capacity for all hours of a day As a result of this assumption the plants studied are assumed to contract for MDth per day of backbone capacity According to the study these units represent ie less than one half of the gasfired capacity in the Los Angeles Basin If all generators in the basin contracted for capacity in this way electric generators alone would demand MDth per day of capacity or of SoCalGas total receipt point capacity There is obviously no such demand today for firm service to electric generators on the SoCalGas system Second the study assumes that the generators will make no effort to broker release or sell the massive amount of excess capacity that they have bought and will derive no revenues from such offpeak capacity sales Thus the studys dire picture of the impact of demand charges on lowload factor generators assumes that such generators massively overcontract for capacity and fail to take advantage of the numerous means available under the Comprehensive Settlement to reduce or eliminate their demand charge risks The Comprehensive Settlement offers an optional backbone rate wit h a demand charge that almost halves the demand charge risk but offers the same firm priority as the SFV demand charge Under the comprehensive settlement interruptible service at volumetric rates is always available at no more than a premium over firm backbone rates and may even be available at less than the firm backbone rates particularly duri ng lowdemand periods With a backbone rate of per Dth this premium is no more than per Dth Ms Yap observes in Section that the interstate pipelines supplying SoCalGas have at least MMcfd or more capacity than SoCalGas intrastate system She does not recognize that SoCalGas backbone system also has more than MMcfd of excess capacity plus substantial excess storage capacity Due t o this excess intrastate capacity it is difficult to imagine a scenario for the foreseeable future in which a low load factor generator would ever have to pay more than the maximu m interruptible rate for virtually firm backbone service I have recalculated the results of the SCGC TURN study under the assumption that generators in the Los Angeles basin take interruptible service i n order to avoid demand charges at the full per Dth premium for interruptible service In this case the generators annual fixed costs increase by just sixtenths of one percent In reality I expect that interruptible or released firm service wil l be available for much of the year at allvolumetric rates that are much less than the maximum interruptible rate The Comprehensive Settlement will establish an active market for the trading of backbone capacity on the SoCalGas system This will provide a means for electric generators to rationalize their holdings of intrastate capacity and may be a source of firm capacity at volumetric rates Again the SCGC TURN study of th e impact of demand charges assumes that generators do not use this secondary market Ms Yap fails to recognize that lowload factor generators will b e able to avoid paying demand charges and save money on intrastate transportation as well by buying gas in the citygate market Ms Yaps primary concern with the cityga te market appears to be the fear that marketers will be able to charge a significant premium for citygate sales during periods of capacity constraints SCGC TURN at Section Ms Yaps testimony fails to explain her assertion that the citygate marke t could become a bottleneck on the SoCalGas system Upstream of the citygate market SoCalGas will have over MMcfd of excess backbone capacity plus significan t amounts of unused storage capacity Ms Yaps bottlenecks and marketermanipulated high prices have not materialized in two years of experience with the PGE citygate market even though PGE has less excess transmission capacity and far less storage capacity than SoCalGas PGE city gate prices did experience one brief spike due to very high dema nd during the cold snap just prior to Christmas in but on average PGE citygate prices have provided significant benefits to end users compared to purchases at the California border In addition the data that Mr Weil cites on the parties holding capacity on the PGE system shows that parties hold capacity on the Redwood path alone an d does not suggest any undue concentration of capacity holdings on the PGE backbone system Ibid Table Section Furthermore the Comprehensive Settlement has numerous provisions to ensure that any one marketer will be unlikely to accumulate a dominant share of capacity to the SoCalGas citygate market First noncore end use customers will have the initial two open seasons in which to subscribe to up to of the available backbone capacity without competition from marketers This should ensure that end users th at are interested in holding capacity will be able to acquire the capacity that they desire and is likely to lead to an even greater number of holders of capacity than resulted fr om the Gas Accord open season in which end users and marketers competed together Second the Comprehensive Settlement limits any one party from holding at the end of the open season process more than of the intrastate capacity from any individual SoCalGas receipt point Third if any party attempts to withhold firm intrastate capacity in an effort to drive up prices that capacity will be available for SoCalGas to sell as interruptible service and SoCalGas will have a strong incentive to market such capacity because it is at risk for the recovery of backbone transmission costs The SCGC TURN testimony tries to portray lowload factor generators as caught in a price squeeze between capped PX prices and increased fixed operating cost s due to the imposition of demand charges for intrastate transmission SCGC TURN Section The testimony paints a grim picture of plants closing and jobs lost in the Lo s Angeles Basin However there are a number of elements in this picture that simply do not add up F The testimony appears to assume that lowload factor generators pay the SFV demand charges and take none of the steps discussed above to mitigate or eliminate the impact of demand charges F The testimony does not recognize that there will be a million do llar reduction in rates to the EG class as a result of the Comprehensive Settlement F The testimony asserts that the increases in operating costs as a re sult of demand charges will be serious enough to force plants to close Even accepting SCGC TURNs inflated figure of a increase in fixed costs SCGC TURN provide no financial dat a that substantiates their assertion that an increase of this magnitude is likely to force a significant number of plants to close F SCGC TURN fail to appreciate the logical way to avoid the price squeeze that they so fear buy gas in the SoCalGas citygate market Citygate buyers will avoid paying demand charges so their fixed operating costs will not increase In additio n the SoCalGas citygate market is likely to be the gas market that is most tightly linked to electric prices in southern California because it will be the closest market to the generators point of consumption and because almost of noncore loads on the SoCalGas SDGE system are electric generators As a result generators buying gas in the SoCalGas citygate market will have the highest assurance that changes in their gas costs will be reflecte d in changes in electric prices thus reducing the risk of a price squeeze between gas and electric prices This has certainly been the case in northern California Straightforward statistical analyses that I have performed show that the PGE citygate gas price is more highly correlated to PX electric prices than are gas prices in any other market in the state presumabl y because electric generators in northern California use that market and because it is th e closest market to the generators burner tips F SCGC TURN attempt to argue that the closure of lowload factor pl ants in the Los Angeles Basin due to the imposition of demand charges will have serious implications for electric reliability SCGC TURN at Section At the same time SCGC TURN argue that generators will not be able to recover demand charges because les s than of the capacity in the basin is under Reliability MustRun RMR contracts an d that there is intense competition for available RMR contracts Yet the lack of RM R contracts in the basin is due to the fact that there is enough capacity in the basin to provide morethan adequate reliability and to assure that few generators can exercise local market power If some generators in the Los Angeles Basin go out of business due to demand charges a more likely scenario than blackouts is that PX prices will rise in southern California the ISO will make available more RMR contracts in the basin and those contracts wi ll provide a higher level of cost recovery thus offsetting the impact of the demand charg es This completes my rebuttal testimony
