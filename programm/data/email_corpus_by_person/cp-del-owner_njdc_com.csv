Pledges Bipartisanship As Dems Take Control Newly installed Senate Majority Leader Daschle today pledged to pursue bipartisanship and what he called united governance as Democrats took control of the Senate Daschle and Minority Leader Lott pledged to work together to conduct business just as they worked through issues when Republicans held the majority Meanwhile Republicans scaled back their demands for what must be included in a new organizing resolution the first major task facing Democrats and Republicans in their newly reversed roles Daschle told reporters he recognized the unique historic nature of a midsession shift in power and said Democrats would strive to be fair in their dealings with the GOP often having criticized Republican rule in the past It would be hypocrisy at its worst if we were going to take the same tactics Were not going to do that said Daschle The tenuous nature of our majority requires that we act accordingly Lott took a similar tone saying The good times we will remember and try to repeat The bad times have already been forgotten There were continuing signs of a deescalation of rhetoric over the organizational resolution which must be passed before new Democratic chairmen can operate their committees effectively And Republicans appear to be backing down on their demand that the resolution establish new procedures to ensure that the Senate considers presidential nominations Senate Republican Conference Chairman Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania who last week hinted Republicans might filibuster the resolution if Democrats did not meet their concerns today said Ive said all along that I dont want to change the rules of the Senate to disadvantage members Democrats despite their accommodating rhetoric have shown no signs of willingness to cede new authority to Republicans on nominations Daschle said Democrats would respect the process currently in place Minority Whip Nickles said I think its going to work I think its going to be fine Nickles said he expected a minimum wage bill accompanied by some tax relief to pass this year But he said it remains to be seen whether a compromise can be reached on a patients rights bill which Daschle has pledged to bring up after completing work on the education bill Sen Olympia Snowe RMaine a key moderate said it would be better if Republicans and Democrats can come to some mutual understanding rather than making some major changes that may not stand the test of time The softening of the GOP stance came as Republicans could no longer ignore their new minority status The Senate today passed a resolution naming Sen Robert Byrd D WVa as the new Senate president pro tempore The Senate Republican Conference was scheduled to meet today to discuss a new organizational resolution and Daschle was scheduled to meet with new committee chairmen Until the Senate passes a new resolution freshmen must go without committee assignments and panels are composed of members from the th Congress many with GOP majorities Daschle said Democrats would make decisions about new panel assignments after the organizational resolution is passed by Geoff Earle and Charlie Mitchell TAXES House Republicans Stress Impact Of Tax Cut Legislation Frustrated that the change in Senate leadership has overshadowed passage of the trillion tax cut House Republicans today redoubled their efforts to tout tax relief as President Bush plans to sign the measure into law Thursday Every paycheck whether it be weekly biweekly or monthly will be bigger in take home pay House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas said at a news conference today with GOP leaders A spokesman for House Speaker Hastert said the defection of Sen James Jeffords IVt saturated media coverage just as the House and Senate passed the tax cut bill Our view is we have to go out there and communicate our message the Hastert spokesman said adding that the new Democraticcontrolled Senate does not override their plans Thomas sought to correct what he said included flat out wrong media explanations of the tax cut Thomas said all taxpayers would get a rebate check beginning this summer He emphasized that it was not a onetime stunt saying the tax cut includes a permanent reduction in income tax rates It is an ongoing gift to the American people who are hard working Thomas said However the tax bill which passed under budget rules includes a provision that would sunset the tax cuts Dec unless they are made permanent Thomas said the Senate was responsible for the sunset provision and sought to put the onus on the Democrats to make tax relief permanent House Majority Leader Armey today said the House would move legislation to do that commenting Why should we tell families and small businesses the relief they need will disappear in years In a memo distributed today to House Republicans Republican Conference Chairman JC Watts of Oklahoma who is responsible for GOP communications said Jeffords switch complicated his partys ability to talk about tax relief Sen Jeffords decision to leave the Republican Party was clearly not good news and had two significant ripple effects however temporary for House Republicans he wrote Watts said the Jeffords defection gave Democrats a forum to blast Republicans and saturated the media so that insufficient attention was given to the tax cut bill Meanwhile Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley R Iowa said it was possible to take up a bill extending the expiring tax breaks this year while adding I think thats probably wishful thinking although I would welcome it He said he had met with Finance Chairman Baucus and the two would continue to work together on prescription drug legislation and upcoming trade issues He mentioned small business tax breaks and energy provisions as other tax legislation that could still move this year He also said Sen Rick Santorum RPa may be the leading candidate to take the new seat on the Finance Committee created by the party switch of Jeffords But he noted Sens Mike DeWine ROhio and Fred Thompson RTenn are both more senior although they would have to relinquish other prestige assignments to claim it by Mark Wegner POLITICS House GOP Moderates Seeking Progress On Key Issues House Republican moderates said today their leadership has made no special effort to reach out to them in the wake of the defection of Sen James Jeffords IVt but complimented House Speaker Hasterts leadership style and attentiveness to their priorities House GOP moderates hope to see movement on such issues as patients rights a prescription drug benefit campaign finance reform and the environment Moderates such as Rep Sherwood Boehlert RNY described the Senate as a body of independent operators and said the Jeffords defection is less relevant to House moderates especially given Hasterts openness We have access He hears us out We could not ask for a better leader for the time Boehlert said He said the leadership might not always heed moderates wishes but said he has seen progress this year on some environmental issues debt reduction and education Boehlert said even House Majority Whip DeLay often a target of Democrats for his conservative positions has reached out not only postJeffords but preJeffords Rep Marge Roukema RNJ similarly said she has seen no additional outreach from leadership but called Jeffords decision a red flag for national party leaders In a twoparty system you need to bring people together if we are to be in the majority she said Roukema cited education reform as good evidence of excellent progress but said she also would like to see action on prescription drugs and campaign finance reform Rep Christopher Shays RConn who urged Jeffords not to defect and has been largely content with Hasterts treatment of campaign finance reform said moderate issues have found their way onto the table this year Thats why we dont have the problem in the House Shays said Speaking with reporters Tuesday National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia used a sports metaphor to describe Hasterts management of the GOP Conference Davis said that unlike the Senate House Republicans may disagree in private but play team ball in public The key to our success is we all play together Davis said Hardline conservative positions do sometimes make floor votes difficult for members representing marginal districts Rep Michael Castle RDel said he hopes the new Democraticcontrolled Senate might provide an opening for President Bush to be more collaborative in his approach Id assume our leaders think pure Republican positions need to be established in the House but some of us in the House would prefer that we prenegotiate some things like weve done on education Castle said There will be some pulling and tugging as we go along by Mark Wegner ENERGY House Drops Calif Energy Bill Daschle Wants Action House Republicans pulled the plug on a shortterm California electricity relief bill today after failing to strike a deal with Democrats on a controversial price cap provision The development comes as two leading Senate Democrats plan to make California energy legislation a top priority of the Democrats first month in power Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Bingaman will focus on producing a shortterm bill in the next few weeks before shifting to a more comprehensive energy bill after the July Fourth recess he said today Well see what we can agree on in a shortterm bill by July Bingaman said at a session with reporters Meanwhile Majority Leader Daschle clarifying earlier remarks said Congress should order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to limit prices in Californias wholesale electricity market if FERC refuses to act In a letter to California Democratic Gov Gray Davis Daschle said that unless FERC curbs wholesale prices Congress will have to consider legislation to address this issue Although Daschle said he does not believe Congress can or should establish a dollar amount for the price of electricity he endorsed legislation offered by Sens Dianne Feinstein DCalif and Gordon Smith ROre that orders FERC to limit prices Unless FERC acts soon Daschle said the legislation should be taken up and passed I will support all necessary efforts to meet that goal Daschles comments come after Daschle appeared to soften his support for price caps in a Los Angeles Times interview late last week On the other side of the Capitol House Democrats blasted Republicans for calling off an Energy and Commerce Committee markup of the California bill I think that the canceling of the markup was a mistake Energy and Commerce ranking member John Dingell DMich said at a news conference Earlier Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin and Energy and Commerce Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton RTexas told reporters they pulled the bill to protect good relations on the panel The Republican leaders said they had the votes to pass the bill and reject a Democratic amendment to limit wholesale prices But the contentious votes would have made it more difficult to gather Democratic support for the more comprehensive energy plan this summer Still Tauzin said the planned committee action had spurred the Bush administration and California lawmakers to implement many of its provisions Barton the author of the bill said the victory was bittersweet I hope I dont have many more victories like this he grumbled by Brody Mullins ENERGY GOP Defends Bush Energy Policy Against Attacks Republican legislators on the House Resources Committee and Interior Secretary Norton today made a preemptive strike against critics of President Bushs national energy policy at a news conference before Nortons testimony before the committee Resources Chairman Hansen Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin and Norton defended the administrations energy policy repeating the mantra that the proposal includes environmental protections conservation initiatives and renewable and alternative energy measures as well as provisions to increase domestic oil production Tauzin adamantly took issue with criticism against increasing domestic oil production arguing that the United States must increase domestic oil supplies to prevent future energy crises and reduce its dependence upon other countries But Tauzin was also quick to add that Congress and the administration will concentrate their efforts big time on conservation demand reduction environmental protections and alternative energy sources Fielding questions on the issue of opening up newly designated national monuments for drilling Norton said the Interior Department is studying the designated lands on a casebycase basis receiving comments from state and local officials on support for the national monuments which were designated by the Clinton administration during its final days Norton noted that some states steadfastly support their national monuments while others vehemently oppose the land restrictions adding that the department will take this into consideration before opening these lands up for domestic oil production Added Hansen What can be opened up should be At the other end of the hall two Democratic panel members held their own news conference to call attention to a designated area in Montana that will be opened for drilling in July A coalition of American Indian tribes and environmental groups joined Rep Frank Pallone DNJ and Resources ranking member Nick Rahall DWVa to introduce legislation to overturn a federal permit allowing oil drilling in Weatherman Draw a pristine Montana valley The coalition argued the site contains one of the most significant collections of Indian art on the Northern Plans including prehistoric multicolored drawings of shields animals and human figures Last month a state agency gave Denverbased Anschutz Exploration Corp permission for exploratory drilling in the valley Anschutz holds leases to oil rights on two parcels of land in Weatherman Draw and has permission to start drilling as early as July During Nortons testimony Rahall asked Norton to use her authority to stop the drilling but Norton declined to say whether she would prohibit the drilling but promised to continue to monitor the area and work with local officials and tribal groups by Greta Wodele FINANCE LaFalce Promises Review Of SEC Protection Of Investors House Financial Services ranking member John LaFalce DNY said today he intends to aggressively pursue an investigation into the SECs capacity to protect investors saying that too much of Congress financial agenda traditionally has been industry driven A case in point LaFalce told a group of reporters is pending SEC fee reduction legislation which he said ought to have been considered in the context of an examination of what the needs and role of the SEC should be While saying he is not opposed to a fee reduction for investors LaFalce said he felt a much larger look at issues and questions was warranted While acknowledging the committees work in the area of financial modernization he said This has been the agenda of industry Asserting that investor protections have been ignored for the last years LaFalce said one issue where there is a crying need for a thorough exhaustive investigation is the capacity of the SEC to protect investors given the agencys limited resources and reach of the law I intend to pursue this aggressively In that vein LaFalce expressed a desire to see the SECs enforcement capabilities beefed up by increasing the agencys enforcement staff not by or percent but by to percent With the Senates shift from Republican to Democratic control LaFalce contended that the stumbling block to consumer advocacy in that chamber has been eradicated Proponents of consumer advocacy have been emboldened Noting that newly installed Senate Banking Chairman Sarbanes shares his consumer protection concerns LaFalce said he expected he would be helped both offensively and defensively in the House It will help me both advance my agenda and stop agendas I oppose LaFalce said Overall LaFalce surmised he would be afforded greater leverage in the legislative negotiations and in setting the agenda If you know an issue is going to be taken up in conference you might as well take it up now LaFalce said As for House Financial Services Chairman Oxley who has been criticized in some circles as relying too heavily on the financial industry in setting his agenda and priorities LaFalce described their working relationship as still evolving While expressing great affection for Oxley personally as a friend of years LaFalce said he had yet to glean Oxleys substantive disposition on a number of fronts consumer protection included He intimated there might be too much top down control with the full committee dictating to subcommittee chairmen on what and when to hold hearings and markups I dont think thats the way to legislate LaFalce said That is not my idea of thoughtful legislating by Pamela Barnett HEALTH Managed Care Industry Faults Bill Over Litigation Factor Leaders of the managed care industry today sketched out for reporters what will likely become a familiar theme over the next several weeks as the Senate prepares to debate a patients rights bill that the leading bipartisan measure would hurt patients more than it would help them It would be impossible not to conclude that this is a trial lawyer takeover of the healthcare system Karen Ignagni president and CEO of the American Association of Health Plans said at a briefing Ignagni said that by dramatically expanding the right to sue health plans in both state and federal courts the bill sponsored by Senate Commerce ranking member John McCain RAriz Sen John Edwards DNC and Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy would equally dramatically increase the cost of health insurance And the only way for employers to recoup is for workers to trade additional wages or workers will have to pay more directly for health care Ignagni said While the AAHP has expressed concerns with the leading alternative measure sponsored by Sens Bill Frist RTenn John Breaux DLa and James Jeffords IVt and backed by President Bush Ignagni was careful not to rule out the possibility that the organization could ultimately back some expansion of liability in federal court only While the organization has been steadfast over the past five years in its opposition to any expansion of liability while supporting a requirement for independent outside review of health plan denials Ignagni said a decision to support the FristBreaux Jeffords bill or any other substitute will be made by our members who will be instructing us every step of the way Ignagni said she also expects that insurance and business opponents could soon be joined by the hospital industry which has been largely supportive of patients rights legislation particularly provisions that would require insurers to pay for emergency room care Further study of liability language has shown that it could not only expose physicians to new lawsuits Ignagni said but also hospitals Every hospital in this country is as vulnerable as every physician she said by Julie Rovner TRADE Legislators Urge ITC Review Of Canadian Wheat Board Senate Finance Chairman Baucus Budget Chairman Conrad Sens Byron Dorgan DND and Conrad Burns RMont and Larry Craig RIdaho and Rep Earl Pomeroy DND today urged the International Trade Commission at a hearing to pursue an aggressive investigation of the Canadian Wheat Board a state trading enterprise that exports all western Canadian wheat Former Trade Representative Barshefsky requested the investigation under Section of the Trade Act last October and the ITC has said it will submit a confidential report to the Office of the US Trade Representative by Sept Wheat farmers in the Northern Plains have complained that since the CanadaUS Free Trade Agreement went into effect in the Canadian Wheat Board has been using unfair and secretive trading practices to sell wheat in the United States and in markets where US and Canadian producers compete What we need from the commission in this investigation is an exhaustive catalog and description of the discriminatory pricing policies of the wheat board and the most precise possible quantification of the effects on US producers of these unfair practices Baucus said And we need that information to be made available to interested parties and the public to the maximum extent possible Charging that the Canadian government and the wheat board have stonewalled previous US efforts to get information on the wheat boards operations Baucus urged the ITC to use all secondary sources in the US government and the US and Canadian private sectors to collect information and draw meaningful conclusions Craig noted that while the USTR request was in response to a petition from the North Dakota Wheat Commission the investigation has the support of national and other state wheat groups as well Both Craig and Pomeroy pointed out support for future trade agreements has eroded in the northern border states because residents there believe the agreement with Canada has worked to their disadvantage Pomeroy also said that if the Canadians refuse to provide information silence can and must be used against them Dorgan said US farmers had been patient with the government for years and that the US response to the Canadian situation to date has been pathetic An ITC official noted during the hearing that the Canadian Wheat Board was invited to testify but chose not to by Jerry Hagstrom FINANCE Grassley To Form Strategy With House Republicans On Bankruptcy Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley RIowa today said he intends to meet as early as this week with House Republican leadership and committee chairmen to try and forge a consensus strategy on the difficult parliamentary situation brewing on bankruptcy reform legislation The House and Senate each have passed individual bills but Republicans want to avoid reopening the measure in conference The House has the option of taking up the Senatepassed bill but Grassley indicated that is unlikely noting the Senate bills inclusion of language pertaining to homestead exemptions and clinic violence ENERGY Dems Ask Burton To Investigate Cheneys Energy Task Force House Government Reform Committee Democrats Tuesday wrote Government Reform Chairman Burton to urge him to look into Vice President Cheneys energy task force which met privately with major Republican donors in formulating the Bush administrations energy policy the Associated Press reported Government Reform ranking member Henry Waxman DCalif asked Burton to conduct a hearing on what took place at the Cheney groups secret meetings and the identities of all participants The Cheney task force has conducted its meetings in private and reportedly has obtained input from private citizens and groups including political contributors Waxman wrote in the letter The AP reported last month that GOP contributors including executives from power wholesaler Enron and the Edison Electric Institute the utility industry lobbying group had met with Cheney to discuss energy policy A committee spokesman said the Republican staff has not had a chance to discuss the letter with Burton POLITICS Evans Participates In Steel Industry Rally Commerce Secretary Evans joined members of Congress from both parties today in pledging to stand with the United Steelworkers of America in their effort to help the ailing domestic steel industry Evans presence at rally at the Capitol came one day after the administration announced it was starting a Section action in response to evidence of serious injury the industry has suffered as a result of allegedly illegal dumping by foreign producers Evans said the move was just a first step in addressing what has become an uneven playing field Just how far the administration would go beyond taking action under existing trade laws is not clear While the workers and their allies in Congress greeted the news of the Section action positively they pressed today for passage of a bill that would also provide government subsidies to help ailing steel manufacturers rebuild and recover and shore up health and retirement funds hit hard by the crisis in the last few years POLITICS Watson Wins Special Election Democratic state Sen Diane Watson coasted to an easy victory Tuesday in the special election to pick a successor to the late Rep Julian Dixon DCalif With all precincts reporting Watson a former ambassador and the first black woman elected to the California state Senate had percent of the vote while Republican nominee Noel Irwin Hentschel had percent Watsons victory means the House Republicans now hold a majority with two independents and two vacancies The next special election will be held June to fill the vacancy created by the death of Rep Norman Sisisky DVa while a special election has yet to be set to choose a successor to the late Rep Joe Moakley DMass who died on Memorial Day Watson will be sworn into her new office Thursday Watsons election was virtually assured once she won the Democratic nomination since the nd District is percent Democratic Its population is percent black with a growing number of Hispanics THE FINAL WORD Im hoping someday the weight comes back as it was fated to be Senate Minority Leader Lott today comparing the job of majority leader to that of Atlas carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders as Democrats became the Senate majority and Lott lost the majority leaders post he

Negotiating Authority A Must Evans Says Top administration officials suggested today they are stepping up their push for presidential trade negotiating authority rejecting suggestions by Finance Chairman Baucus that the bill may not move this year and showing flexibility on the controversial Jordan free trade agreement which is backed by some key Democrats Presidential trade negotiating authority is number one on my list of issues that I am focusing on right now Commerce Secretary Evans told a small group of reporters Evans said he was surprised that Baucus had reportedly said the bill could slip into next year Evans and a senior administration official also in on the session insisted that the bill must pass this year They indicated not only was the trade negotiating authority needed to help move negotiations along with Chile and for a Free Trade Area of the Americas but passage would help bolster US credibility as it tries to launch a new trade round Evans pledged he would aggressively argue for free trade to the American people and that President Bush would be touting it as well Evans also said the point of this weeks announcement that the United States would investigate limiting steel imports under section of US trade law was to see whether the steel industry needed help but he noted that if the move made Democrats more comfortable backing trade negotiating authority then all the better The senior official indicated the administration was considering allowing the Jordan trade deal to maintain provisions that could lead to enforcement of its labor and environmental provisions with sanctions The bill is supported by some Democrats who want a tougher line on these issues Some business officials oppose the deal others are not taking a position I think we are all coming around to the conclusion that one size does not fit all the official said Theres a lot of debate about whether Jordans going to provide a way forward I think its a model I dont think it is necessarily the model But he added I think theres a number of different ways to approach the problem and Jordans one of them And he compared Jordans provisions to a portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement by Keith Koffler TAXES Gephardt Promises Offsets For Any Further Tax Cuts House Minority Leader Gephardt pledged today that Democrats will resist any move to pay for additional tax cuts this year with Medicare and Social Security trust fund money but echoed Senate Majority Leader Daschles comments Wednesday that there would be offsets for any additional tax relief that might be on the way this year At a news conference criticizing the trillion tax cut that became law today Gephardt and other Democratic leaders acknowledged that energyrelated tax cuts and renewal of a group of tax credits that expire this year are just some of the items Congress may need to address Noting that GOP appropriators have already signaled they need more money for FY appropriations bills Gephardt said it will be hard for Democrats and Republicans to advocate additional spending or tax relief but added We will have offsets We hope the Republicans will do the same For now he could offer no specific ideas on what the offsets would be but he left the door open to even looking at the newly enacted tax bill as a source of funds Daschle also said it was likely that future Congresses may need to modify the year bill President Bush signed today in order to keep the budget balanced but played down the notion such revisions could happen as early as this year Ways and Means ranking member Charles Rangel DNY said the real impact of the tax cut is years away and claimed that President George W is saying Not on my watch The question of what tax measures could come next prompted a letter from Rangel to Ways and Means Chairman Thomas Sources said Rangel learned this week that GOP leaders were considering trying to move a patients rights bill quickly even if it meant having the bill go right to the floor There may have also been discussions about similarly speedy treatment for an energy related tax break measure But Rangel and Ways and Means Health Subcommittee ranking member Fortney Pete Stark DCalif wrote Thomas today to express our strong opposition to such an effort and hope that you will join us in defending the jurisdiction and rights of the committee to act in this legislative arena you know the Health Subcommittee already has had one hearing this year on this important topic Meanwhile GOP leaders are apparently eyeing a number of other priorities House Republican Conference Chairman JC Watts of Oklahoma renewed his call for expanding tax deductions for charitable contributions in his statement greeting Bushs signature of the tax cut bill Majority Leader Armey has said more tax relief should be on the way but he acknowledged it could be modest by Stephen Norton TAXES Bush Signs Trillion Year Tax Cut Measure Surrounded in the ornate East Room by a crowd comprised mostly of elite Republican lawmakers President Bush today signed into law the trillion year tax relief package The legislation which largely takes its cue from Bushs signature campaign proposal was hailed by Bush as a historic achievement ranking with tax reduction bills signed by former Presidents Kennedy and Reagan Bush praised the role of some of the handful of Democrats on hand including Senate Finance Chairman Baucus and Sens John Breaux of Louisiana and Zell Miller of Georgia Tax relief is the first achievement produced by the new tone in Washington Bush said Calling this an era of steady cooperation Bush predicted more achievements are ahead But few Democrats showed up to witness this particular moment of the new era Among them were Sens Max Cleland of Georgia Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Reps Ralph Hall of Texas Ken Lucas of Kentucky and Bud Cramer of Alabama Republican leaders such as House Speaker Hastert Senate Minority Leader Lott House Majority Leader Armey Senate Minority Whip Nickles House Majority Whip DeLay House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas and Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley RIowa were more typical of those attending the billsigning ceremony Senior Senate Republicans declared afterward that one of their top priorities this summer will be to make the tax cut which expires in a decade permanent Sen Phil Gramm of Texas vowed to aggressively move the legislation as an amendment The first thing we have got to do is make this tax cut permanent Gramm told CongressDaily I intend to offer it at least a dozen times Nickles said Republicans will be successful in either extending the rate reduction or extending the zero bracket for estate taxes I think but he acknowledged Its going to be a challenge Nickles added that he still will try to reduce the capital gains tax from percent to percent to provide tax breaks for unemployed and those lacking employer assistance to buy health insurance and add tax cuts to the minimum wage bill Other tax cut vehicles he said could be the Patients Bill of Rights and the tax extenders bill On managed care reform Nickles said there are some discussions going on but I wouldnt try to claim any optimism about a deal by Keith Koffler HEALTH Senate Readies For Debate On Patients Rights Proposal With the Senate still mired in debate over the education bill behindthescenes discussions are picking up on what is expected to be the chambers next order of business debate on a managed care Patients Bill of Rights HHS Secretary Thompson was on Capitol Hill today to meet separately with Senate Democratic and GOP leaders to discuss a potential compromise on an issue whose differences have thus far proved unbridgeable President Bush earlier this spring vowed to veto the bill Democrats intend to bring to the floor sponsored by Senate Commerce ranking member John McCain RAriz Sen John Edwards DNC and Health Education Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy And Bush has endorsed a competing bill sponsored by Sens Bill Frist RTenn John Breaux DLa and James Jeffords IVt At the same time Rep Charlie Norwood RGa who helped write the McCainEdwards Kennedy bill but deferred sponsorship while he sought to negotiate with the White House is continuing his efforts but signaled he will not wait much longer After one of his meetings today Thompson tried to strike a conciliatory tone We hope were able to reach an agreement he said but added that if the president feels strongly and this bill doesnt reach his principles he will veto it Meanwhile backers of the FristBreauxJeffords approach said new estimates from CBO show that their bill should represent the final compromise According to CBO the FristBreauxJeffords bill would when fully phased in raise health insurance premiums by an estimated percent That compares to percent for the McCainEdwardsKennedy bill and percent for the GOPsponsored bill that passed the Senate in Todays CBO report illustrates what weve said all along that our bill presents a true compromise on the Patients Bill of Rights said Frist But the veto question appears the key to the upcoming debate Backers of the McCainEdwardsKennedy measure insist that the president will sign virtually any patients rights bill Congress manages to pass That prospect has frightened business and insurance lobbyists who vehemently oppose provisions that would allow broad new rights to sue health plans in state and federal court Administration officials Wednesday denied widespread speculation that Bush would soon issue a formal statement again threatening to veto the bill but also left what one source called wiggle room if the Senate makes some as yet undecided upon changes While opponents of the McCainEdwardsKennedy measure fear they lack the votes to defeat or even substantially change the measure it appears to have virtually unanimous support among Democrats save Breaux as well as at least a handful of Republicans including Sens Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania opponents are more confident about their ability to add to the measure a package of tax related health insurance access provisions Some of those including a broad expansion of Medical Savings Accounts could be controversial by Julie Rovner and April Fulton SENATE LEADERSHIP Craig Predicts Senate Organizational Deal By Next Week Senate Republican and Democratic leaders are nearing agreement on a new organizational resolution for the Senate although key senators predicted the issue would not be resolved until next week Sen Phil Gramm RTexas said he hoped negotiators would be able to complete an agreement today Sen Pete Domenici R NM said Republicans were purifying their own proposals to decide how many points to include Gramm and Domenici are part of a fivemember GOP task force assigned by Minority Leader Lott to negotiate a new resolution with Majority Leader Daschle Daschle said today negotiations were going well but declined to give details The group is expected to meet again with Daschle today But before any deal is final Republicans will run any agreement that is reached by the entire GOP Conference a requirement that led Republican Policy Committee Chairman Larry Craig of Idaho to predict a deal would not be finalized until midweek Republicans have backed down on their requirement that any new resolution include a mechanism to move presidential nominations to the floor Instead said a GOP aide negotiators will assemble a memorandum or some sort of written statement or a colloquy for leaders to deliver on the floor Democrats meanwhile have given in to a GOP demand that committees be expanded to reflect a oneseat Democratic advantage rather than bumping Republicans from panels Said Commerce Chairman Hollings Im not comfortable with it but thats what its going to be Hollings panel will grow to members a size he said will make it hard to hold efficient hearings You get through opening statements and good God the day is over he said by Geoff Earle GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS Lieberman To Probe Decisions On Energy Environment Senate Governmental Affairs Chairman Lieberman today promised not to use his new chairmanship to practice the politics of personal attacks and destruction but said he will investigate the high cost of energy as well as ask the Bush administration to explain its rescission of federal environmental standards The current high price of energy and shortages in energy supply in some parts of our country will be the committees immediate priority Lieberman said in an agenda session with reporters Lieberman has scheduled a hearing next Wednesday to look at the deregulation of the electricity and natural gas industries and a June hearing to consider whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has done enough to keep electricity prices reasonable From all that I have seen I think FERC has the authority to act and should have acted already Lieberman said A cosponsor of price cap legislation proposed by Sens Dianne Feinstein D Calif and Gordon Smith ROre Lieberman said he would not ordinarily favor price controls but said the lack of competition in the Western energy market warrants them Lieberman said he also wanted to know how Bush administration officials decided so quickly to roll back federal standards regulating arsenic forest roadbuilding and mining waste Who did you talk to Lieberman asked rhetorically of the administrations rapid rollback of federal policy long in the making He also said he would put the breaks on any additional plans the White House has to roll back environmental standards Lieberman said he had a good relationship with ranking member Fred Thompson RTenn and said they would work together on issues such as reducing government waste and abuse electronic government initiatives and attracting new and qualified federal personnel As the Democratic vice presidential nominee in last years disputed election Lieberman was asked to clarify his vow not to use his committee for political retribution The difference between oversight and overkill is in the eye of the beholder but you and I will know it once we see it he said When asked specifically about whether he would investigate Vice President Cheneys use of his official residence at the US Naval Observatory for a political event Lieberman said definitively no but compared it to former President Clintons White House coffees It did make me laugh because the event and the explanation of the event sounded very similar to what Republicans said about the coffees Lieberman said by Mark Wegner ENVIRONMENT Interior Approps Panel Restores Bush Energy Land Cuts The House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee unanimously approved an billion spending bill today that restores President Bushs proposed cuts in energy research and increases funding for energy conservation and land preservation initiatives National Journal News Service reported The measure provides billion for energy programs an increase of million over the administrations request The panel included million for weatherization and state energy grants which is an increase of million over last years level and includes million for overall energy conservation Calling the restoration of energy conservation and research funding crucial given the nations electricity woes subcommittee ranking member Norman Dicks DWash hailed the panels very bipartisan effort and dedication to conservation spending This is a good example of how we can cooperate and work on a bipartisan basis he said In addition to the increased energy funding the subcommittee also agreed to provide billion for the widely heralded land conservation initiative launched last year as a compromise to the controversial Conservation and Reinvestment Act Although significantly smaller than CARA the conservation initiative nonetheless represents a doubling of federal spending on a variety of resource conservation programs The bill increases funding by million over last years level and million over the administrations request The program includes million for state wildlife grants million for wetlands conservation million for historic preservation and million in conservation incentives for private landowners House Appropriations ranking member David Obey DWis said the increase in conservation funding keeps a commitment the Congress made to the compromise program last year when appropriators balked at CARAs year budget commitment to land programs That should send a message to the administration that they ought to recognize a good deal when they see it Obey said Appropriations Chairman Young said he expected the full committee to mark up the Interior spending bill next Wednesday by Cyril Zaneski EDUCATION GOP Criticizes Plan To Restrict Straight As Initiative Republicans today said an amendment to the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act exempting one category of school funding from a trial program known as Straight As would gut a major component of the presidents education bill The amendment to exempt st

Meanwhile the Senate set aside another Dodd amendment today after Republicans threatened a filibuster delaying a potentially explosive vote which Republicans said goes to the heart of whether Congress wants federal or local control over schools The amendment would require states to achieve comparability of education opportunities among their schools and was watered down from earlier more specific language This is not radical this is common sense Dodd said during floor debate Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy said the amendment does not interfere with the presidents initiative and encourages states to provide additional focus and attention on poor and underprivileged children But Collins said it was an attempt by the federal government to set national standards

making those commitments legally enforceable by including them in their customer contracts House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Young and Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee Chairman John Mica RFla applauded the industrys latest commitment saying airlines should not bear sole blame for air travel delays Citing weather difficulties as the leading cause of delay Young and Mica also singled out local opposition to runway construction as a factor in air congestion and delay Fairly narrow passengers rights legislation pending in the Senate would strengthen the governments hand in holding the airline industry to better standards and was expected to come to the floor for a vote in that chamber Among the airlines latest commitments are pledges to offer the lowest fare available on the telephone reservation system to notify passengers of known delays cancellations and diversions and to meet passengers essential needs during long onaircraft delays

Pledges Bipartisanship As Dems Take Control Newly installed Senate Majority Leader Daschle today pledged to pursue bipartisanship and what he called united governance as Democrats took control of the Senate Daschle and Minority Leader Lott pledged to work together to conduct business just as they worked through issues when Republicans held the majority Meanwhile Republicans scaled back their demands for what must be included in a new organizing resolution the first major task facing Democrats and Republicans in their newly reversed roles Daschle told reporters he recognized the unique historic nature of a midsession shift in power and said Democrats would strive to be fair in their dealings with the GOP often having criticized Republican rule in the past It would be hypocrisy at its worst if we were going to take the same tactics Were not going to do that said Daschle The tenuous nature of our majority requires that we act accordingly Lott took a similar tone saying The good times we will remember and try to repeat The bad times have already been forgotten There were continuing signs of a deescalation of rhetoric over the organizational resolution which must be passed before new Democratic chairmen can operate their committees effectively And Republicans appear to be backing down on their demand that the resolution establish new procedures to ensure that the Senate considers presidential nominations Senate Republican Conference Chairman Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania who last week hinted Republicans might filibuster the resolution if Democrats did not meet their concerns today said Ive said all along that I dont want to change the rules of the Senate to disadvantage members Democrats despite their accommodating rhetoric have shown no signs of willingness to cede new authority to Republicans on nominations Daschle said Democrats would respect the process currently in place Minority Whip Nickles said I think its going to work I think its going to be fine Nickles said he expected a minimum wage bill accompanied by some tax relief to pass this year But he said it remains to be seen whether a compromise can be reached on a patients rights bill which Daschle has pledged to bring up after completing work on the education bill Sen Olympia Snowe RMaine a key moderate said it would be better if Republicans and Democrats can come to some mutual understanding rather than making some major changes that may not stand the test of time The softening of the GOP stance came as Republicans could no longer ignore their new minority status The Senate today passed a resolution naming Sen Robert Byrd D WVa as the new Senate president pro tempore The Senate Republican Conference was scheduled to meet today to discuss a new organizational resolution and Daschle was scheduled to meet with new committee chairmen Until the Senate passes a new resolution freshmen must go without committee assignments and panels are composed of members from the th Congress many with GOP majorities Daschle said Democrats would make decisions about new panel assignments after the organizational resolution is passed by Geoff Earle and Charlie Mitchell TAXES House Republicans Stress Impact Of Tax Cut Legislation Frustrated that the change in Senate leadership has overshadowed passage of the trillion tax cut House Republicans today redoubled their efforts to tout tax relief as President Bush plans to sign the measure into law Thursday Every paycheck whether it be weekly biweekly or monthly will be bigger in take home pay House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas said at a news conference today with GOP leaders A spokesman for House Speaker Hastert said the defection of Sen James Jeffords IVt saturated media coverage just as the House and Senate passed the tax cut bill Our view is we have to go out there and communicate our message the Hastert spokesman said adding that the new Democraticcontrolled Senate does not override their plans Thomas sought to correct what he said included flat out wrong media explanations of the tax cut Thomas said all taxpayers would get a rebate check beginning this summer He emphasized that it was not a onetime stunt saying the tax cut includes a permanent reduction in income tax rates It is an ongoing gift to the American people who are hard working Thomas said However the tax bill which passed under budget rules includes a provision that would sunset the tax cuts Dec unless they are made permanent Thomas said the Senate was responsible for the sunset provision and sought to put the onus on the Democrats to make tax relief permanent House Majority Leader Armey today said the House would move legislation to do that commenting Why should we tell families and small businesses the relief they need will disappear in years In a memo distributed today to House Republicans Republican Conference Chairman JC Watts of Oklahoma who is responsible for GOP communications said Jeffords switch complicated his partys ability to talk about tax relief Sen Jeffords decision to leave the Republican Party was clearly not good news and had two significant ripple effects however temporary for House Republicans he wrote Watts said the Jeffords defection gave Democrats a forum to blast Republicans and saturated the media so that insufficient attention was given to the tax cut bill Meanwhile Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley R Iowa said it was possible to take up a bill extending the expiring tax breaks this year while adding I think thats probably wishful thinking although I would welcome it He said he had met with Finance Chairman Baucus and the two would continue to work together on prescription drug legislation and upcoming trade issues He mentioned small business tax breaks and energy provisions as other tax legislation that could still move this year He also said Sen Rick Santorum RPa may be the leading candidate to take the new seat on the Finance Committee created by the party switch of Jeffords But he noted Sens Mike DeWine ROhio and Fred Thompson RTenn are both more senior although they would have to relinquish other prestige assignments to claim it by Mark Wegner POLITICS House GOP Moderates Seeking Progress On Key Issues House Republican moderates said today their leadership has made no special effort to reach out to them in the wake of the defection of Sen James Jeffords IVt but complimented House Speaker Hasterts leadership style and attentiveness to their priorities House GOP moderates hope to see movement on such issues as patients rights a prescription drug benefit campaign finance reform and the environment Moderates such as Rep Sherwood Boehlert RNY described the Senate as a body of independent operators and said the Jeffords defection is less relevant to House moderates especially given Hasterts openness We have access He hears us out We could not ask for a better leader for the time Boehlert said He said the leadership might not always heed moderates wishes but said he has seen progress this year on some environmental issues debt reduction and education Boehlert said even House Majority Whip DeLay often a target of Democrats for his conservative positions has reached out not only postJeffords but preJeffords Rep Marge Roukema RNJ similarly said she has seen no additional outreach from leadership but called Jeffords decision a red flag for national party leaders In a twoparty system you need to bring people together if we are to be in the majority she said Roukema cited education reform as good evidence of excellent progress but said she also would like to see action on prescription drugs and campaign finance reform Rep Christopher Shays RConn who urged Jeffords not to defect and has been largely content with Hasterts treatment of campaign finance reform said moderate issues have found their way onto the table this year Thats why we dont have the problem in the House Shays said Speaking with reporters Tuesday National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia used a sports metaphor to describe Hasterts management of the GOP Conference Davis said that unlike the Senate House Republicans may disagree in private but play team ball in public The key to our success is we all play together Davis said Hardline conservative positions do sometimes make floor votes difficult for members representing marginal districts Rep Michael Castle RDel said he hopes the new Democraticcontrolled Senate might provide an opening for President Bush to be more collaborative in his approach Id assume our leaders think pure Republican positions need to be established in the House but some of us in the House would prefer that we prenegotiate some things like weve done on education Castle said There will be some pulling and tugging as we go along by Mark Wegner ENERGY House Drops Calif Energy Bill Daschle Wants Action House Republicans pulled the plug on a shortterm California electricity relief bill today after failing to strike a deal with Democrats on a controversial price cap provision The development comes as two leading Senate Democrats plan to make California energy legislation a top priority of the Democrats first month in power Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Bingaman will focus on producing a shortterm bill in the next few weeks before shifting to a more comprehensive energy bill after the July Fourth recess he said today Well see what we can agree on in a shortterm bill by July Bingaman said at a session with reporters Meanwhile Majority Leader Daschle clarifying earlier remarks said Congress should order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to limit prices in Californias wholesale electricity market if FERC refuses to act In a letter to California Democratic Gov Gray Davis Daschle said that unless FERC curbs wholesale prices Congress will have to consider legislation to address this issue Although Daschle said he does not believe Congress can or should establish a dollar amount for the price of electricity he endorsed legislation offered by Sens Dianne Feinstein DCalif and Gordon Smith ROre that orders FERC to limit prices Unless FERC acts soon Daschle said the legislation should be taken up and passed I will support all necessary efforts to meet that goal Daschles comments come after Daschle appeared to soften his support for price caps in a Los Angeles Times interview late last week On the other side of the Capitol House Democrats blasted Republicans for calling off an Energy and Commerce Committee markup of the California bill I think that the canceling of the markup was a mistake Energy and Commerce ranking member John Dingell DMich said at a news conference Earlier Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin and Energy and Commerce Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton RTexas told reporters they pulled the bill to protect good relations on the panel The Republican leaders said they had the votes to pass the bill and reject a Democratic amendment to limit wholesale prices But the contentious votes would have made it more difficult to gather Democratic support for the more comprehensive energy plan this summer Still Tauzin said the planned committee action had spurred the Bush administration and California lawmakers to implement many of its provisions Barton the author of the bill said the victory was bittersweet I hope I dont have many more victories like this he grumbled by Brody Mullins ENERGY GOP Defends Bush Energy Policy Against Attacks Republican legislators on the House Resources Committee and Interior Secretary Norton today made a preemptive strike against critics of President Bushs national energy policy at a news conference before Nortons testimony before the committee Resources Chairman Hansen Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin and Norton defended the administrations energy policy repeating the mantra that the proposal includes environmental protections conservation initiatives and renewable and alternative energy measures as well as provisions to increase domestic oil production Tauzin adamantly took issue with criticism against increasing domestic oil production arguing that the United States must increase domestic oil supplies to prevent future energy crises and reduce its dependence upon other countries But Tauzin was also quick to add that Congress and the administration will concentrate their efforts big time on conservation demand reduction environmental protections and alternative energy sources Fielding questions on the issue of opening up newly designated national monuments for drilling Norton said the Interior Department is studying the designated lands on a casebycase basis receiving comments from state and local officials on support for the national monuments which were designated by the Clinton administration during its final days Norton noted that some states steadfastly support their national monuments while others vehemently oppose the land restrictions adding that the department will take this into consideration before opening these lands up for domestic oil production Added Hansen What can be opened up should be At the other end of the hall two Democratic panel members held their own news conference to call attention to a designated area in Montana that will be opened for drilling in July A coalition of American Indian tribes and environmental groups joined Rep Frank Pallone DNJ and Resources ranking member Nick Rahall DWVa to introduce legislation to overturn a federal permit allowing oil drilling in Weatherman Draw a pristine Montana valley The coalition argued the site contains one of the most significant collections of Indian art on the Northern Plans including prehistoric multicolored drawings of shields animals and human figures Last month a state agency gave Denverbased Anschutz Exploration Corp permission for exploratory drilling in the valley Anschutz holds leases to oil rights on two parcels of land in Weatherman Draw and has permission to start drilling as early as July During Nortons testimony Rahall asked Norton to use her authority to stop the drilling but Norton declined to say whether she would prohibit the drilling but promised to continue to monitor the area and work with local officials and tribal groups by Greta Wodele FINANCE LaFalce Promises Review Of SEC Protection Of Investors House Financial Services ranking member John LaFalce DNY said today he intends to aggressively pursue an investigation into the SECs capacity to protect investors saying that too much of Congress financial agenda traditionally has been industry driven A case in point LaFalce told a group of reporters is pending SEC fee reduction legislation which he said ought to have been considered in the context of an examination of what the needs and role of the SEC should be While saying he is not opposed to a fee reduction for investors LaFalce said he felt a much larger look at issues and questions was warranted While acknowledging the committees work in the area of financial modernization he said This has been the agenda of industry Asserting that investor protections have been ignored for the last years LaFalce said one issue where there is a crying need for a thorough exhaustive investigation is the capacity of the SEC to protect investors given the agencys limited resources and reach of the law I intend to pursue this aggressively In that vein LaFalce expressed a desire to see the SECs enforcement capabilities beefed up by increasing the agencys enforcement staff not by or percent but by to percent With the Senates shift from Republican to Democratic control LaFalce contended that the stumbling block to consumer advocacy in that chamber has been eradicated Proponents of consumer advocacy have been emboldened Noting that newly installed Senate Banking Chairman Sarbanes shares his consumer protection concerns LaFalce said he expected he would be helped both offensively and defensively in the House It will help me both advance my agenda and stop agendas I oppose LaFalce said Overall LaFalce surmised he would be afforded greater leverage in the legislative negotiations and in setting the agenda If you know an issue is going to be taken up in conference you might as well take it up now LaFalce said As for House Financial Services Chairman Oxley who has been criticized in some circles as relying too heavily on the financial industry in setting his agenda and priorities LaFalce described their working relationship as still evolving While expressing great affection for Oxley personally as a friend of years LaFalce said he had yet to glean Oxleys substantive disposition on a number of fronts consumer protection included He intimated there might be too much top down control with the full committee dictating to subcommittee chairmen on what and when to hold hearings and markups I dont think thats the way to legislate LaFalce said That is not my idea of thoughtful legislating by Pamela Barnett HEALTH Managed Care Industry Faults Bill Over Litigation Factor Leaders of the managed care industry today sketched out for reporters what will likely become a familiar theme over the next several weeks as the Senate prepares to debate a patients rights bill that the leading bipartisan measure would hurt patients more than it would help them It would be impossible not to conclude that this is a trial lawyer takeover of the healthcare system Karen Ignagni president and CEO of the American Association of Health Plans said at a briefing Ignagni said that by dramatically expanding the right to sue health plans in both state and federal courts the bill sponsored by Senate Commerce ranking member John McCain RAriz Sen John Edwards DNC and Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy would equally dramatically increase the cost of health insurance And the only way for employers to recoup is for workers to trade additional wages or workers will have to pay more directly for health care Ignagni said While the AAHP has expressed concerns with the leading alternative measure sponsored by Sens Bill Frist RTenn John Breaux DLa and James Jeffords IVt and backed by President Bush Ignagni was careful not to rule out the possibility that the organization could ultimately back some expansion of liability in federal court only While the organization has been steadfast over the past five years in its opposition to any expansion of liability while supporting a requirement for independent outside review of health plan denials Ignagni said a decision to support the FristBreaux Jeffords bill or any other substitute will be made by our members who will be instructing us every step of the way Ignagni said she also expects that insurance and business opponents could soon be joined by the hospital industry which has been largely supportive of patients rights legislation particularly provisions that would require insurers to pay for emergency room care Further study of liability language has shown that it could not only expose physicians to new lawsuits Ignagni said but also hospitals Every hospital in this country is as vulnerable as every physician she said by Julie Rovner TRADE Legislators Urge ITC Review Of Canadian Wheat Board Senate Finance Chairman Baucus Budget Chairman Conrad Sens Byron Dorgan DND and Conrad Burns RMont and Larry Craig RIdaho and Rep Earl Pomeroy DND today urged the International Trade Commission at a hearing to pursue an aggressive investigation of the Canadian Wheat Board a state trading enterprise that exports all western Canadian wheat Former Trade Representative Barshefsky requested the investigation under Section of the Trade Act last October and the ITC has said it will submit a confidential report to the Office of the US Trade Representative by Sept Wheat farmers in the Northern Plains have complained that since the CanadaUS Free Trade Agreement went into effect in the Canadian Wheat Board has been using unfair and secretive trading practices to sell wheat in the United States and in markets where US and Canadian producers compete What we need from the commission in this investigation is an exhaustive catalog and description of the discriminatory pricing policies of the wheat board and the most precise possible quantification of the effects on US producers of these unfair practices Baucus said And we need that information to be made available to interested parties and the public to the maximum extent possible Charging that the Canadian government and the wheat board have stonewalled previous US efforts to get information on the wheat boards operations Baucus urged the ITC to use all secondary sources in the US government and the US and Canadian private sectors to collect information and draw meaningful conclusions Craig noted that while the USTR request was in response to a petition from the North Dakota Wheat Commission the investigation has the support of national and other state wheat groups as well Both Craig and Pomeroy pointed out support for future trade agreements has eroded in the northern border states because residents there believe the agreement with Canada has worked to their disadvantage Pomeroy also said that if the Canadians refuse to provide information silence can and must be used against them Dorgan said US farmers had been patient with the government for years and that the US response to the Canadian situation to date has been pathetic An ITC official noted during the hearing that the Canadian Wheat Board was invited to testify but chose not to by Jerry Hagstrom FINANCE Grassley To Form Strategy With House Republicans On Bankruptcy Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley RIowa today said he intends to meet as early as this week with House Republican leadership and committee chairmen to try and forge a consensus strategy on the difficult parliamentary situation brewing on bankruptcy reform legislation The House and Senate each have passed individual bills but Republicans want to avoid reopening the measure in conference The House has the option of taking up the Senatepassed bill but Grassley indicated that is unlikely noting the Senate bills inclusion of language pertaining to homestead exemptions and clinic violence ENERGY Dems Ask Burton To Investigate Cheneys Energy Task Force House Government Reform Committee Democrats Tuesday wrote Government Reform Chairman Burton to urge him to look into Vice President Cheneys energy task force which met privately with major Republican donors in formulating the Bush administrations energy policy the Associated Press reported Government Reform ranking member Henry Waxman DCalif asked Burton to conduct a hearing on what took place at the Cheney groups secret meetings and the identities of all participants The Cheney task force has conducted its meetings in private and reportedly has obtained input from private citizens and groups including political contributors Waxman wrote in the letter The AP reported last month that GOP contributors including executives from power wholesaler Enron and the Edison Electric Institute the utility industry lobbying group had met with Cheney to discuss energy policy A committee spokesman said the Republican staff has not had a chance to discuss the letter with Burton POLITICS Evans Participates In Steel Industry Rally Commerce Secretary Evans joined members of Congress from both parties today in pledging to stand with the United Steelworkers of America in their effort to help the ailing domestic steel industry Evans presence at rally at the Capitol came one day after the administration announced it was starting a Section action in response to evidence of serious injury the industry has suffered as a result of allegedly illegal dumping by foreign producers Evans said the move was just a first step in addressing what has become an uneven playing field Just how far the administration would go beyond taking action under existing trade laws is not clear While the workers and their allies in Congress greeted the news of the Section action positively they pressed today for passage of a bill that would also provide government subsidies to help ailing steel manufacturers rebuild and recover and shore up health and retirement funds hit hard by the crisis in the last few years POLITICS Watson Wins Special Election Democratic state Sen Diane Watson coasted to an easy victory Tuesday in the special election to pick a successor to the late Rep Julian Dixon DCalif With all precincts reporting Watson a former ambassador and the first black woman elected to the California state Senate had percent of the vote while Republican nominee Noel Irwin Hentschel had percent Watsons victory means the House Republicans now hold a majority with two independents and two vacancies The next special election will be held June to fill the vacancy created by the death of Rep Norman Sisisky DVa while a special election has yet to be set to choose a successor to the late Rep Joe Moakley DMass who died on Memorial Day Watson will be sworn into her new office Thursday Watsons election was virtually assured once she won the Democratic nomination since the nd District is percent Democratic Its population is percent black with a growing number of Hispanics THE FINAL WORD Im hoping someday the weight comes back as it was fated to be Senate Minority Leader

Negotiating Authority A Must Evans Says Top administration officials suggested today they are stepping up their push for presidential trade negotiating authority rejecting suggestions by Finance Chairman Baucus that the bill may not move this year and showing flexibility on the controversial Jordan free trade agreement which is backed by some key Democrats Presidential trade negotiating authority is number one on my list of issues that I am focusing on right now Commerce Secretary Evans told a small group of reporters Evans said he was surprised that Baucus had reportedly said the bill could slip into next year Evans and a senior administration official also in on the session insisted that the bill must pass this year They indicated not only was the trade negotiating authority needed to help move negotiations along with Chile and for a Free Trade Area of the Americas but passage would help bolster US credibility as it tries to launch a new trade round Evans pledged he would aggressively argue for free trade to the American people and that President Bush would be touting it as well Evans also said the point of this weeks announcement that the United States would investigate limiting steel imports under section of US trade law was to see whether the steel industry needed help but he noted that if the move made Democrats more comfortable backing trade negotiating authority then all the better The senior official indicated the administration was considering allowing the Jordan trade deal to maintain provisions that could lead to enforcement of its labor and environmental provisions with sanctions The bill is supported by some Democrats who want a tougher line on these issues Some business officials oppose the deal others are not taking a position I think we are all coming around to the conclusion that one size does not fit all the official said Theres a lot of debate about whether Jordans going to provide a way forward I think its a model I dont think it is necessarily the model But he added I think theres a number of different ways to approach the problem and Jordans one of them And he compared Jordans provisions to a portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement by Keith Koffler TAXES Gephardt Promises Offsets For Any Further Tax Cuts House Minority Leader Gephardt pledged today that Democrats will resist any move to pay for additional tax cuts this year with Medicare and Social Security trust fund money but echoed Senate Majority Leader Daschles comments Wednesday that there would be offsets for any additional tax relief that might be on the way this year At a news conference criticizing the trillion tax cut that became law today Gephardt and other Democratic leaders acknowledged that energyrelated tax cuts and renewal of a group of tax credits that expire this year are just some of the items Congress may need to address Noting that GOP appropriators have already signaled they need more money for FY appropriations bills Gephardt said it will be hard for Democrats and Republicans to advocate additional spending or tax relief but added We will have offsets We hope the Republicans will do the same For now he could offer no specific ideas on what the offsets would be but he left the door open to even looking at the newly enacted tax bill as a source of funds Daschle also said it was likely that future Congresses may need to modify the year bill President Bush signed today in order to keep the budget balanced but played down the notion such revisions could happen as early as this year Ways and Means ranking member Charles Rangel DNY said the real impact of the tax cut is years away and claimed that President George W is saying Not on my watch The question of what tax measures could come next prompted a letter from Rangel to Ways and Means Chairman Thomas Sources said Rangel learned this week that GOP leaders were considering trying to move a patients rights bill quickly even if it meant having the bill go right to the floor There may have also been discussions about similarly speedy treatment for an energy related tax break measure But Rangel and Ways and Means Health Subcommittee ranking member Fortney Pete Stark DCalif wrote Thomas today to express our strong opposition to such an effort and hope that you will join us in defending the jurisdiction and rights of the committee to act in this legislative arena you know the Health Subcommittee already has had one hearing this year on this important topic Meanwhile GOP leaders are apparently eyeing a number of other priorities House Republican Conference Chairman JC Watts of Oklahoma renewed his call for expanding tax deductions for charitable contributions in his statement greeting Bushs signature of the tax cut bill Majority Leader Armey has said more tax relief should be on the way but he acknowledged it could be modest by Stephen Norton TAXES Bush Signs Trillion Year Tax Cut Measure Surrounded in the ornate East Room by a crowd comprised mostly of elite Republican lawmakers President Bush today signed into law the trillion year tax relief package The legislation which largely takes its cue from Bushs signature campaign proposal was hailed by Bush as a historic achievement ranking with tax reduction bills signed by former Presidents Kennedy and Reagan Bush praised the role of some of the handful of Democrats on hand including Senate Finance Chairman Baucus and Sens John Breaux of Louisiana and Zell Miller of Georgia Tax relief is the first achievement produced by the new tone in Washington Bush said Calling this an era of steady cooperation Bush predicted more achievements are ahead But few Democrats showed up to witness this particular moment of the new era Among them were Sens Max Cleland of Georgia Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Reps Ralph Hall of Texas Ken Lucas of Kentucky and Bud Cramer of Alabama Republican leaders such as House Speaker Hastert Senate Minority Leader Lott House Majority Leader Armey Senate Minority Whip Nickles House Majority Whip DeLay House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas and Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley RIowa were more typical of those attending the billsigning ceremony Senior Senate Republicans declared afterward that one of their top priorities this summer will be to make the tax cut which expires in a decade permanent Sen Phil Gramm of Texas vowed to aggressively move the legislation as an amendment The first thing we have got to do is make this tax cut permanent Gramm told CongressDaily I intend to offer it at least a dozen times Nickles said Republicans will be successful in either extending the rate reduction or extending the zero bracket for estate taxes I think but he acknowledged Its going to be a challenge Nickles added that he still will try to reduce the capital gains tax from percent to percent to provide tax breaks for unemployed and those lacking employer assistance to buy health insurance and add tax cuts to the minimum wage bill Other tax cut vehicles he said could be the Patients Bill of Rights and the tax extenders bill On managed care reform Nickles said there are some discussions going on but I wouldnt try to claim any optimism about a deal by Keith Koffler HEALTH Senate Readies For Debate On Patients Rights Proposal With the Senate still mired in debate over the education bill behindthescenes discussions are picking up on what is expected to be the chambers next order of business debate on a managed care Patients Bill of Rights HHS Secretary Thompson was on Capitol Hill today to meet separately with Senate Democratic and GOP leaders to discuss a potential compromise on an issue whose differences have thus far proved unbridgeable President Bush earlier this spring vowed to veto the bill Democrats intend to bring to the floor sponsored by Senate Commerce ranking member John McCain RAriz Sen John Edwards DNC and Health Education Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy And Bush has endorsed a competing bill sponsored by Sens Bill Frist RTenn John Breaux DLa and James Jeffords IVt At the same time Rep Charlie Norwood RGa who helped write the McCainEdwards Kennedy bill but deferred sponsorship while he sought to negotiate with the White House is continuing his efforts but signaled he will not wait much longer After one of his meetings today Thompson tried to strike a conciliatory tone We hope were able to reach an agreement he said but added that if the president feels strongly and this bill doesnt reach his principles he will veto it Meanwhile backers of the FristBreauxJeffords approach said new estimates from CBO show that their bill should represent the final compromise According to CBO the FristBreauxJeffords bill would when fully phased in raise health insurance premiums by an estimated percent That compares to percent for the McCainEdwardsKennedy bill and percent for the GOPsponsored bill that passed the Senate in Todays CBO report illustrates what weve said all along that our bill presents a true compromise on the Patients Bill of Rights said Frist But the veto question appears the key to the upcoming debate Backers of the McCainEdwardsKennedy measure insist that the president will sign virtually any patients rights bill Congress manages to pass That prospect has frightened business and insurance lobbyists who vehemently oppose provisions that would allow broad new rights to sue health plans in state and federal court Administration officials Wednesday denied widespread speculation that Bush would soon issue a formal statement again threatening to veto the bill but also left what one source called wiggle room if the Senate makes some as yet undecided upon changes While opponents of the McCainEdwardsKennedy measure fear they lack the votes to defeat or even substantially change the measure it appears to have virtually unanimous support among Democrats save Breaux as well as at least a handful of Republicans including Sens Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania opponents are more confident about their ability to add to the measure a package of tax related health insurance access provisions Some of those including a broad expansion of Medical Savings Accounts could be controversial by Julie Rovner and April Fulton SENATE LEADERSHIP Craig Predicts Senate Organizational Deal By Next Week Senate Republican and Democratic leaders are nearing agreement on a new organizational resolution for the Senate although key senators predicted the issue would not be resolved until next week Sen Phil Gramm RTexas said he hoped negotiators would be able to complete an agreement today Sen Pete Domenici R NM said Republicans were purifying their own proposals to decide how many points to include Gramm and Domenici are part of a fivemember GOP task force assigned by Minority Leader Lott to negotiate a new resolution with Majority Leader Daschle Daschle said today negotiations were going well but declined to give details The group is expected to meet again with Daschle today But before any deal is final Republicans will run any agreement that is reached by the entire GOP Conference a requirement that led Republican Policy Committee Chairman Larry Craig of Idaho to predict a deal would not be finalized until midweek Republicans have backed down on their requirement that any new resolution include a mechanism to move presidential nominations to the floor Instead said a GOP aide negotiators will assemble a memorandum or some sort of written statement or a colloquy for leaders to deliver on the floor Democrats meanwhile have given in to a GOP demand that committees be expanded to reflect a oneseat Democratic advantage rather than bumping Republicans from panels Said Commerce Chairman Hollings Im not comfortable with it but thats what its going to be Hollings panel will grow to members a size he said will make it hard to hold efficient hearings You get through opening statements and good God the day is over he said by Geoff Earle GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS Lieberman To Probe Decisions On Energy Environment Senate Governmental Affairs Chairman Lieberman today promised not to use his new chairmanship to practice the politics of personal attacks and destruction but said he will investigate the high cost of energy as well as ask the Bush administration to explain its rescission of federal environmental standards The current high price of energy and shortages in energy supply in some parts of our country will be the committees immediate priority Lieberman said in an agenda session with reporters Lieberman has scheduled a hearing next Wednesday to look at the deregulation of the electricity and natural gas industries and a June hearing to consider whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has done enough to keep electricity prices reasonable From all that I have seen I think FERC has the authority to act and should have acted already Lieberman said A cosponsor of price cap legislation proposed by Sens Dianne Feinstein D Calif and Gordon Smith ROre Lieberman said he would not ordinarily favor price controls but said the lack of competition in the Western energy market warrants them Lieberman said he also wanted to know how Bush administration officials decided so quickly to roll back federal standards regulating arsenic forest roadbuilding and mining waste Who did you talk to Lieberman asked rhetorically of the administrations rapid rollback of federal policy long in the making He also said he would put the breaks on any additional plans the White House has to roll back environmental standards Lieberman said he had a good relationship with ranking member Fred Thompson RTenn and said they would work together on issues such as reducing government waste and abuse electronic government initiatives and attracting new and qualified federal personnel As the Democratic vice presidential nominee in last years disputed election Lieberman was asked to clarify his vow not to use his committee for political retribution The difference between oversight and overkill is in the eye of the beholder but you and I will know it once we see it he said When asked specifically about whether he would investigate Vice President Cheneys use of his official residence at the US Naval Observatory for a political event Lieberman said definitively no but compared it to former President Clintons White House coffees It did make me laugh because the event and the explanation of the event sounded very similar to what Republicans said about the coffees Lieberman said by Mark Wegner ENVIRONMENT Interior Approps Panel Restores Bush Energy Land Cuts The House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee unanimously approved an billion spending bill today that restores President Bushs proposed cuts in energy research and increases funding for energy conservation and land preservation initiatives National Journal News Service reported The measure provides billion for energy programs an increase of million over the administrations request The panel included million for weatherization and state energy grants which is an increase of million over last years level and includes million for overall energy conservation Calling the restoration of energy conservation and research funding crucial given the nations electricity woes subcommittee ranking member Norman Dicks DWash hailed the panels very bipartisan effort and dedication to conservation spending This is a good example of how we can cooperate and work on a bipartisan basis he said In addition to the increased energy funding the subcommittee also agreed to provide billion for the widely heralded land conservation initiative launched last year as a compromise to the controversial Conservation and Reinvestment Act Although significantly smaller than CARA the conservation initiative nonetheless represents a doubling of federal spending on a variety of resource conservation programs The bill increases funding by million over last years level and million over the administrations request The program includes million for state wildlife grants million for wetlands conservation million for historic preservation and million in conservation incentives for private landowners House Appropriations ranking member David Obey DWis said the increase in conservation funding keeps a commitment the Congress made to the compromise program last year when appropriators balked at CARAs year budget commitment to land programs That should send a message to the administration that they ought to recognize a good deal when they see it Obey said Appropriations Chairman Young said he expected the full committee to mark up the Interior spending bill next Wednesday by Cyril Zaneski EDUCATION GOP Criticizes Plan To Restrict Straight As Initiative Republicans today said an amendment to the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act exempting one category of school funding from a trial program known as Straight As would gut a major component of the presidents education bill The amendment to exempt st Century learning centers from the Straight As pilot program would remove almost half of the available money and would discourage states from participating Sen Bill Frist RTenn said If the amendment passes it would certainly be a blow to the bipartisan coalition that has worked on this bill said Sen Susan Collins RMaine The Straight As program was taken out of the bill on the House side so Frist said it was essential the provision stay in the Senate bill when the bills go to conference Sen Christopher Dodd DConn who is sponsoring the amendment said he still plans to move forward on it Meanwhile the Senate set aside another Dodd amendment today after Republicans threatened a filibuster delaying a potentially explosive vote which Republicans said goes to the heart of whether Congress wants federal or local control over schools The amendment would require states to achieve comparability of education opportunities among their schools and was watered down from earlier more specific language This is not radical this is common sense Dodd said during floor debate Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy said the amendment does not interfere with the presidents initiative and encourages states to provide additional focus and attention on poor and underprivileged children But Collins said it was an attempt by the federal government to set national standards by April Fulton SCHEDULE Senate To Work Through Amendments On Education Next Week The Senate next week will work through amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization bill Majority Leader Daschle said votes are expected Monday and that he intends to finish the bill by the end of the week The House will return next week Tuesday for a series of suspension votes after pm

said the amount of aid for this year might be higher than billion in the FY budget resolution That money would come from a billion multiyear pool of funds created to increase agricultural spending

Washington bash than this evening Sources said the DASHPAC gala which is being held at the restaurant is expected to pull in over million and possibly break the PACs previous record Tickets to tonights gala are going for per individual per PAC or for corporate donors the PAC has a limit for contributors On K Street lots of heavy lifting has been done by several blue chip lobbyists including

Finds Smith Shaheen Tied A new American Research Group poll shows Sen Bob Smith R NH in a statistical tie with Democratic Gov Jeanne Shaheen but it also shows GOP Rep John Sununu leading Shaheen by double digits in a trial heat of the election The poll conducted last Friday through Monday of registered voters with a point error margin shows Smith leading Shaheen percent with percent undecided But Sununu leads Shaheen percent with percent undecided Sununu has been contemplating a challenge to Smith who briefly left the Republican Party in during his unsuccessful presidential campaign and the Manchester UnionLeader reported today that many state Republicans believe that Sununu has passed the point of no return and will indeed challenge Smith in the GOP primary However a recent invitation Sununu sent out for a June fundraiser headlined by former President Bush talks about a House re election campaign In the letter which refers to his Democratic challenger Martha Fuller Clark Sununu wrote We had a hard fought campaign last year in less than six months time my opponent spent over million already she has announced her candidacy for Our campaign next year will be at least as tough if not tougher Sununu can transfer the money to a Senate campaign if he decides to enter that race TRANSPORTATION Airlines Offer More Voluntary Commitments To Improve Customer Services In an

making those commitments legally enforceable by including them in their customer contracts House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Young and Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee Chairman John Mica RFla applauded the industrys latest commitment saying airlines should not bear sole blame for air travel delays Citing weather difficulties as the leading cause of delay Young and Mica also singled out local opposition to runway construction as a factor in air congestion and delay Fairly narrow passengers rights legislation pending in the Senate would strengthen the governments hand in holding the airline industry to better standards and was expected to come to the floor for a vote in that chamber Among the airlines latest commitments are pledges to offer the lowest fare available on the telephone reservation system to notify passengers of known delays cancellations and diversions and to meet passengers essential needs during long onaircraft delays AGRICULTURE Veneman Defends Her Undersecretary Choice Agriculture Secretary Veneman defended a nominee for a top position at her department against allegations he was insensitive to minorities and

work together The Senate Agriculture Committee has not scheduled a hearing on Dorrs nomination Senate Agriculture Chairman Harkin has not taken a position on Dorr In a recent letter to the committee

Negotiating Authority A Must Evans Says Top administration officials suggested today they are stepping up their push for presidential trade negotiating authority rejecting suggestions by Finance Chairman Baucus that the bill may not move this year and showing flexibility on the controversial Jordan free trade agreement which is backed by some key Democrats Presidential trade negotiating authority is number one on my list of issues that I am focusing on right now Commerce Secretary Evans told a small group of reporters Evans said he was surprised that Baucus had reportedly said the bill could slip into next year Evans and a senior administration official also in on the session insisted that the bill must pass this year They indicated not only was the trade negotiating authority needed to help move negotiations along with Chile and for a Free Trade Area of the Americas but passage would help bolster US credibility as it tries to launch a new trade round Evans pledged he would aggressively argue for free trade to the American people and that President Bush would be touting it as well Evans also said the point of this weeks announcement that the United States would investigate limiting steel imports under section of US trade law was to see whether the steel industry needed help but he noted that if the move made Democrats more comfortable backing trade negotiating authority then all the better The senior official indicated the administration was considering allowing the Jordan trade deal to maintain provisions that could lead to enforcement of its labor and environmental provisions with sanctions The bill is supported by some Democrats who want a tougher line on these issues Some business officials oppose the deal others are not taking a position I think we are all coming around to the conclusion that one size does not fit all the official said Theres a lot of debate about whether Jordans going to provide a way forward I think its a model I dont think it is necessarily the model But he added I think theres a number of different ways to approach the problem and Jordans one of them And he compared Jordans provisions to a portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement by Keith Koffler TAXES Gephardt Promises Offsets For Any Further Tax Cuts House Minority Leader Gephardt pledged today that Democrats will resist any move to pay for additional tax cuts this year with Medicare and Social Security trust fund money but echoed Senate Majority Leader Daschles comments Wednesday that there would be offsets for any additional tax relief that might be on the way this year At a news conference criticizing the trillion tax cut that became law today Gephardt and other Democratic leaders acknowledged that energyrelated tax cuts and renewal of a group of tax credits that expire this year are just some of the items Congress may need to address Noting that GOP appropriators have already signaled they need more money for FY appropriations bills Gephardt said it will be hard for Democrats and Republicans to advocate additional spending or tax relief but added We will have offsets We hope the Republicans will do the same For now he could offer no specific ideas on what the offsets would be but he left the door open to even looking at the newly enacted tax bill as a source of funds Daschle also said it was likely that future Congresses may need to modify the year bill President Bush signed today in order to keep the budget balanced but played down the notion such revisions could happen as early as this year Ways and Means ranking member Charles Rangel DNY said the real impact of the tax cut is years away and claimed that President George W is saying Not on my watch The question of what tax measures could come next prompted a letter from Rangel to Ways and Means Chairman Thomas Sources said Rangel learned this week that GOP leaders were considering trying to move a patients rights bill quickly even if it meant having the bill go right to the floor There may have also been discussions about similarly speedy treatment for an energy related tax break measure But Rangel and Ways and Means Health Subcommittee ranking member Fortney Pete Stark DCalif wrote Thomas today to express our strong opposition to such an effort and hope that you will join us in defending the jurisdiction and rights of the committee to act in this legislative arena you know the Health Subcommittee already has had one hearing this year on this important topic Meanwhile GOP leaders are apparently eyeing a number of other priorities House Republican Conference Chairman JC Watts of Oklahoma renewed his call for expanding tax deductions for charitable contributions in his statement greeting Bushs signature of the tax cut bill Majority Leader Armey has said more tax relief should be on the way but he acknowledged it could be modest by Stephen Norton TAXES Bush Signs Trillion Year Tax Cut Measure Surrounded in the ornate East Room by a crowd comprised mostly of elite Republican lawmakers President Bush today signed into law the trillion year tax relief package The legislation which largely takes its cue from Bushs signature campaign proposal was hailed by Bush as a historic achievement ranking with tax reduction bills signed by former Presidents Kennedy and Reagan Bush praised the role of some of the handful of Democrats on hand including Senate Finance Chairman Baucus and Sens John Breaux of Louisiana and Zell Miller of Georgia Tax relief is the first achievement produced by the new tone in Washington Bush said Calling this an era of steady cooperation Bush predicted more achievements are ahead But few Democrats showed up to witness this particular moment of the new era Among them were Sens Max Cleland of Georgia Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Reps Ralph Hall of Texas Ken Lucas of Kentucky and Bud Cramer of Alabama Republican leaders such as House Speaker Hastert Senate Minority Leader Lott House Majority Leader Armey Senate Minority Whip Nickles House Majority Whip DeLay House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas and Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley RIowa were more typical of those attending the billsigning ceremony Senior Senate Republicans declared afterward that one of their top priorities this summer will be to make the tax cut which expires in a decade permanent Sen Phil Gramm of Texas vowed to aggressively move the legislation as an amendment The first thing we have got to do is make this tax cut permanent Gramm told CongressDaily I intend to offer it at least a dozen times Nickles said Republicans will be successful in either extending the rate reduction or extending the zero bracket for estate taxes I think but he acknowledged Its going to be a challenge Nickles added that he still will try to reduce the capital gains tax from percent to percent to provide tax breaks for unemployed and those lacking employer assistance to buy health insurance and add tax cuts to the minimum wage bill Other tax cut vehicles he said could be the Patients Bill of Rights and the tax extenders bill On managed care reform Nickles said there are some discussions going on but I wouldnt try to claim any optimism about a deal by Keith Koffler HEALTH Senate Readies For Debate On Patients Rights Proposal With the Senate still mired in debate over the education bill behindthescenes discussions are picking up on what is expected to be the chambers next order of business debate on a managed care Patients Bill of Rights HHS Secretary Thompson was on Capitol Hill today to meet separately with Senate Democratic and GOP leaders to discuss a potential compromise on an issue whose differences have thus far proved unbridgeable President Bush earlier

historic nature of a midsession shift in power and said Democrats would strive to be fair in their dealings with the GOP often having criticized Republican rule in the past It would be hypocrisy at its worst if we were going to take the same tactics Were not going to do that said Daschle The tenuous nature of our majority requires that we act accordingly Lott took a similar tone saying The good times we will remember and try to repeat The bad times have already been forgotten There were continuing signs of a deescalation of rhetoric over the organizational resolution which must be passed before new Democratic chairmen can operate their committees effectively And Republicans appear to be backing down on their demand that the resolution establish new procedures to ensure that the Senate considers presidential nominations Senate Republican Conference Chairman Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania who last week hinted Republicans might filibuster the resolution if Democrats did not meet their concerns today said Ive said all along that I dont want to change the rules of the Senate to disadvantage members Democrats despite their accommodating rhetoric have shown no signs of willingness to cede new authority to Republicans on nominations Daschle said Democrats would respect the process currently in place Minority Whip Nickles said I think its going to work I think its going to be fine Nickles said he expected a minimum wage bill accompanied by some tax relief to pass this year But he said it remains to be seen whether a compromise can be reached on a patients rights bill which Daschle has pledged to bring up after completing work on the education bill Sen Olympia Snowe RMaine a key moderate said it would be better if Republicans and Democrats can come to some mutual understanding rather than making some major changes that may not stand the test of time The softening of the GOP stance came as Republicans could no longer ignore their new minority status The Senate today passed a resolution naming Sen Robert Byrd D WVa as the new Senate president pro tempore The Senate Republican Conference was scheduled to meet today to discuss a new organizational resolution and Daschle was scheduled to meet with new committee chairmen Until the Senate passes a new resolution freshmen must go without committee assignments and panels are composed of members from the th Congress many with GOP majorities Daschle said Democrats would make decisions about new panel assignments after the organizational resolution is passed by Geoff Earle and Charlie Mitchell TAXES House Republicans Stress Impact Of Tax Cut Legislation Frustrated that the change in Senate leadership has overshadowed passage of the trillion tax cut House Republicans today redoubled their efforts to tout tax relief as President Bush plans to sign the measure into law Thursday Every paycheck whether it be weekly biweekly or monthly will be bigger in take home pay House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas said at a news conference today with GOP leaders A spokesman for House Speaker Hastert said the defection of Sen James Jeffords IVt saturated media coverage just as the House and Senate passed the tax cut bill Our view is we have to go out there and communicate our message the Hastert spokesman said adding that the new Democraticcontrolled Senate does not override their plans Thomas sought to correct what he said included flat out wrong media explanations of the tax cut Thomas said all taxpayers would get a rebate check beginning this summer He emphasized that it was not a onetime stunt saying the tax cut includes a permanent reduction in income tax rates It is an ongoing gift to the American people who are hard working Thomas said However the tax bill which passed under budget rules includes a provision that would sunset the tax cuts Dec unless they are made permanent Thomas said the Senate was responsible for the sunset provision and sought to put the onus on the Democrats to make tax relief permanent House Majority Leader Armey today said the House would move legislation to do that commenting Why should we tell families and small businesses the relief they need will disappear in years In a memo distributed today to House Republicans Republican Conference Chairman JC Watts of Oklahoma who is responsible for GOP communications said Jeffords switch complicated his partys ability to talk about tax relief Sen Jeffords decision to leave the Republican Party was clearly not good news and had two significant ripple effects however temporary for House Republicans he wrote Watts said the Jeffords defection gave Democrats a forum to blast Republicans and saturated the media so that insufficient attention was given to the tax cut bill Meanwhile Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley R Iowa said it was possible to take up a bill extending the expiring tax breaks this year while adding I think thats probably wishful thinking although I would welcome it He said he had met with Finance Chairman Baucus and the two would continue to work together on prescription drug legislation and upcoming trade issues He mentioned small business tax breaks and energy provisions as other tax legislation that could still move this year He also said Sen Rick Santorum RPa may be the leading candidate to take the new seat on the Finance Committee created by the party switch of Jeffords But he noted Sens Mike DeWine ROhio and Fred Thompson RTenn are both more senior although they would have to relinquish other prestige assignments to claim it by Mark Wegner POLITICS House GOP Moderates Seeking Progress On Key Issues House Republican moderates said today their leadership has made no special effort to reach out to them in the wake of the defection of Sen James Jeffords IVt but complimented House Speaker Hasterts leadership style and attentiveness to their priorities House GOP moderates hope to see movement on such issues as patients rights a prescription drug benefit campaign finance reform and the environment Moderates such as Rep Sherwood Boehlert RNY described the Senate as a body of independent operators and said the Jeffords defection is less relevant to House moderates especially given Hasterts openness We have access He hears us out We could not ask for a better leader for the time Boehlert said He said the leadership might not always heed moderates wishes but said he has seen progress this year on some environmental issues debt reduction and education Boehlert said even House Majority Whip DeLay often a target of Democrats for his conservative positions has reached out not only postJeffords but preJeffords Rep Marge Roukema RNJ similarly said she has seen no additional outreach from leadership but called Jeffords decision a red flag for national party leaders In a twoparty system you need to bring people together if we are to be in the majority she said Roukema cited education reform as good evidence of excellent progress but said she also would like to see action on prescription drugs and campaign finance reform Rep Christopher Shays RConn who urged Jeffords not to defect and has been largely content with Hasterts treatment of campaign finance reform said moderate issues have found their way onto the table this year Thats why we dont have the problem in the House Shays said Speaking with reporters Tuesday National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia used a sports metaphor to describe Hasterts management of the GOP Conference Davis said that unlike the Senate House Republicans may disagree in private but play team ball in public The key to our success is we all play together Davis said Hardline conservative positions do sometimes make floor votes difficult for members representing marginal districts Rep Michael Castle RDel said he hopes the new Democraticcontrolled Senate might provide an opening for President Bush to be more collaborative in his approach Id assume our leaders think pure Republican positions need to be established in the House but some of us in the House would prefer that we prenegotiate some things like weve done on education Castle said There will be some pulling and tugging as we go along by Mark Wegner ENERGY House Drops Calif Energy Bill Daschle Wants Action House Republicans pulled the plug on a shortterm California electricity relief bill today after failing to strike a deal with Democrats on a controversial price cap provision The development comes as two leading Senate Democrats plan to make California energy legislation a top priority of the Democrats first month in power Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Bingaman will focus on producing a shortterm bill in the next few weeks before shifting to a more comprehensive energy bill after the July Fourth recess he said today Well see what we can agree on in a shortterm bill by July Bingaman said at a session with reporters Meanwhile Majority Leader Daschle clarifying earlier remarks said Congress should order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to limit prices in Californias wholesale electricity market if FERC refuses to act In a letter to California Democratic Gov Gray Davis Daschle said that unless FERC curbs wholesale prices Congress will have to consider legislation to address this issue Although Daschle said he does not believe Congress can or should establish a dollar amount for the price of electricity he endorsed legislation offered by Sens Dianne Feinstein DCalif and Gordon Smith ROre that orders FERC to limit prices Unless FERC acts soon Daschle said the legislation should be taken up and passed I will support all necessary efforts to meet that goal Daschles comments come after Daschle appeared to soften his support for price caps in a Los Angeles Times interview late last week On the other side of the Capitol House Democrats blasted Republicans for calling off an Energy and Commerce Committee markup of the California bill I think that the canceling of the markup was a mistake Energy and Commerce ranking member John Dingell DMich said at a news conference Earlier Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin and Energy and Commerce Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton RTexas told reporters they pulled the bill to protect good relations on the panel The Republican leaders said they had the votes to pass the bill and reject a Democratic amendment to limit wholesale prices But the contentious votes would have made it more difficult to gather Democratic support for the more comprehensive energy plan this summer Still Tauzin said the planned committee action had spurred the Bush administration and California lawmakers to implement many of its provisions Barton the author of the bill said the victory was bittersweet I hope I dont have many more victories like this he grumbled by Brody Mullins ENERGY GOP Defends Bush Energy Policy Against Attacks Republican legislators on the House Resources Committee and Interior Secretary Norton today made a preemptive strike against critics of President Bushs national energy policy at a news conference before Nortons testimony before the committee Resources Chairman Hansen Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin and Norton defended the administrations energy policy repeating the mantra that the proposal includes environmental protections conservation initiatives and renewable and alternative energy measures as well as provisions to increase domestic oil production Tauzin adamantly took issue with criticism against increasing domestic oil production arguing that the United States must increase domestic oil supplies to prevent future energy crises and reduce its dependence upon other countries But Tauzin was also quick to add that Congress and the administration will concentrate their efforts big time on conservation demand reduction environmental protections and alternative energy sources Fielding questions on the issue of opening up newly designated national monuments for drilling Norton said the Interior Department is studying the designated lands on a casebycase basis receiving comments from state and local officials on support for the national monuments which were designated by the Clinton administration during its final days Norton noted that some states steadfastly support their national monuments while others vehemently oppose the land restrictions adding that the department will take this into consideration before opening these lands up for domestic oil production Added Hansen What can be opened up should be At the other end of the hall two Democratic panel members held their own news conference to call attention to a designated area in Montana that will be opened for drilling in July A coalition of American Indian tribes and environmental groups joined Rep Frank Pallone DNJ and Resources ranking member Nick Rahall DWVa to introduce legislation to overturn a federal permit allowing oil drilling in Weatherman Draw a pristine Montana valley The coalition argued the site contains one of the most significant collections of Indian art on the Northern Plans including prehistoric multicolored drawings of shields animals and human figures Last month a state agency gave Denverbased Anschutz Exploration Corp permission for exploratory drilling in the valley Anschutz holds leases to oil rights on two parcels of land in Weatherman Draw and has permission to start drilling as early as July During Nortons testimony Rahall asked Norton to use her authority to stop the drilling but Norton declined to say whether she would prohibit the drilling but promised to continue to monitor the area and work with local officials and tribal groups by Greta Wodele FINANCE LaFalce Promises Review Of SEC Protection Of Investors House Financial Services ranking member John LaFalce DNY said today he intends to aggressively pursue an investigation into the SECs capacity to protect investors saying that too much of Congress financial agenda traditionally has been industry driven A case in point LaFalce told a group of reporters is pending SEC fee reduction legislation which he said ought to have been considered in the context of an examination of what the needs and role of the SEC should be While saying he is not opposed to a fee reduction for investors LaFalce said he felt a much larger look at issues and questions was warranted While acknowledging the committees work in the area of financial modernization he said This has been the agenda of industry Asserting that investor protections have been ignored for the last years LaFalce said one issue where there is a crying need for a thorough exhaustive investigation is the capacity of the SEC to protect investors given the agencys limited resources and reach of the law I intend to pursue this aggressively In that vein LaFalce expressed a desire to see the SECs enforcement capabilities beefed up by increasing the agencys enforcement staff not by or percent but by to percent With the Senates shift from Republican to Democratic control LaFalce contended that the stumbling block to consumer advocacy in that chamber has been eradicated Proponents of consumer advocacy have been emboldened Noting that newly installed Senate Banking Chairman Sarbanes shares his consumer protection concerns LaFalce said he expected he would be helped both offensively and defensively in the House It will help me both advance my agenda and stop agendas I oppose LaFalce said Overall LaFalce surmised he would be afforded greater leverage in the legislative negotiations and in setting the agenda If you know an issue is going to be taken up in conference you might as well take it up now LaFalce said As for House Financial Services Chairman Oxley who has been criticized in some circles as relying too heavily on the financial industry in setting his agenda and priorities LaFalce described their working relationship as still evolving While expressing great affection for Oxley personally as a friend of years LaFalce said he had yet to glean Oxleys substantive disposition on a number of fronts consumer protection included He intimated there might be too much top down control with the full committee dictating to subcommittee chairmen on what and when to hold hearings and markups I dont think thats the way to legislate LaFalce said That is not my idea of thoughtful legislating by Pamela Barnett HEALTH Managed Care Industry Faults Bill Over Litigation Factor Leaders of the managed care industry today sketched out for reporters what will likely become a familiar theme over the next several weeks as the Senate prepares to debate a patients rights bill that the leading bipartisan measure would hurt patients more than it would help them It would be impossible not to conclude that this is a trial lawyer takeover of the healthcare system Karen Ignagni president and CEO of the American Association of Health Plans said at a briefing Ignagni said that by dramatically expanding the right to sue health plans in both state and federal courts the bill sponsored by Senate Commerce ranking member John McCain RAriz Sen John Edwards DNC and Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy would equally dramatically increase the cost of health insurance And the only way for employers to recoup is for workers to trade additional wages or workers will have to pay more directly for health care Ignagni said While the AAHP has expressed concerns with the leading alternative measure sponsored by Sens Bill Frist RTenn John Breaux DLa and James Jeffords IVt and backed by President Bush Ignagni was careful not to rule out the possibility that the organization could ultimately back some expansion of liability in federal court only While the organization has been steadfast over the past five years in its opposition to any expansion of liability while supporting a requirement for independent outside review of health plan denials Ignagni said a decision to support the FristBreaux Jeffords bill or any other substitute will be made by our members who will be instructing us every step of the way Ignagni said she also expects that insurance and business opponents could soon be joined by the hospital industry which has been largely supportive of patients rights legislation particularly provisions that would require insurers to pay for emergency room care Further study of liability language has shown that it could not only expose physicians to new lawsuits Ignagni said but also hospitals Every hospital in this country is as vulnerable as every physician she said by Julie Rovner TRADE Legislators Urge ITC Review Of Canadian Wheat Board Senate Finance Chairman Baucus Budget Chairman Conrad Sens Byron Dorgan DND and Conrad Burns RMont and Larry Craig RIdaho and Rep Earl Pomeroy DND today urged the International Trade Commission at a hearing to pursue an aggressive investigation of the Canadian Wheat Board a state trading enterprise that exports all western Canadian wheat Former Trade Representative Barshefsky requested the investigation under Section of the Trade Act last October and the ITC has said it will submit a confidential report to the Office of the US Trade Representative by Sept Wheat farmers in the Northern Plains have complained that since the CanadaUS Free Trade Agreement went into effect in the Canadian Wheat Board has been using unfair and secretive trading practices to sell wheat in the United States and in markets where US and Canadian producers compete What we need from the commission in this investigation is an exhaustive catalog and description of the discriminatory pricing policies of the wheat board and the most precise possible quantification of the effects on US producers of these unfair practices Baucus said And we need that information to be made available to interested parties and the public to the maximum extent possible Charging that the Canadian government and the wheat board have stonewalled previous US efforts to get information on the wheat boards operations Baucus urged the ITC to use all secondary sources in the US government and the US and Canadian private sectors to collect information and draw meaningful conclusions Craig noted that while the USTR request was in response to a petition from the North Dakota Wheat Commission the investigation has the support of national and other state wheat groups as well Both Craig and Pomeroy pointed out support for future trade agreements has eroded in the northern border states because residents there believe the agreement with Canada has worked to their disadvantage Pomeroy also said that if the Canadians refuse to provide information silence can and must be used against them Dorgan said US farmers had been patient with the government for years and that the US response to the Canadian situation to date has been pathetic An ITC official noted during the hearing that the Canadian Wheat Board was invited to testify but chose not to by Jerry Hagstrom FINANCE Grassley To Form Strategy With House Republicans On Bankruptcy Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley RIowa today said he intends to meet as early as this week with House Republican leadership and committee chairmen to try and forge a consensus strategy on the difficult parliamentary situation brewing on bankruptcy reform legislation The House and Senate each have passed individual bills but Republicans want to avoid reopening the measure in conference The House has the option of taking up the Senatepassed bill but Grassley indicated that is unlikely noting the Senate bills inclusion of language pertaining to homestead exemptions and clinic violence ENERGY Dems Ask Burton To Investigate Cheneys Energy Task Force House Government Reform Committee Democrats Tuesday wrote Government Reform Chairman Burton to urge him to look into Vice President Cheneys energy task force which met privately with major Republican donors in formulating the Bush administrations energy policy the Associated Press reported Government Reform ranking member Henry Waxman DCalif asked Burton to conduct a hearing on what took place at the Cheney groups secret meetings and the identities of all participants The Cheney task force has conducted its meetings in private and reportedly has obtained input from private citizens and groups including political contributors Waxman wrote in the letter The AP reported last month that GOP contributors including executives from power wholesaler Enron and the Edison Electric Institute the utility industry lobbying group had met with Cheney to discuss energy policy A committee spokesman said the Republican staff has not had a chance to discuss the letter with Burton POLITICS Evans Participates In Steel Industry Rally Commerce Secretary Evans joined members of Congress from both parties today in pledging to stand with the United Steelworkers of America in their effort to help the ailing domestic steel industry Evans presence at rally at the Capitol came one day after the administration announced it was starting a Section action in response to evidence of serious injury the industry has suffered as a result of allegedly illegal dumping by foreign producers Evans said the move was just a first step in addressing what has become an uneven playing field Just how far the administration would go beyond taking action under existing trade laws is not clear While the workers and their allies in Congress greeted the news of the Section action positively they pressed today for passage of a bill that would also provide government subsidies to help ailing steel manufacturers rebuild and recover and shore up health and retirement funds hit hard by the crisis in the last few years POLITICS Watson Wins Special Election Democratic state Sen Diane Watson coasted to an easy victory Tuesday in the special election to pick a successor to the late Rep Julian Dixon DCalif With all precincts reporting Watson a former ambassador and the first black woman elected to the California state Senate had percent of the vote while Republican nominee Noel Irwin Hentschel had percent Watsons victory means the House Republicans now hold a majority with two independents and
