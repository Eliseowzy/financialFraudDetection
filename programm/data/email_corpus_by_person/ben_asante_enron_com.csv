Original Message From Roensch David Sent Tuesday December PM To Asante Ben McChane Bob Matthews Ron Cc Jolly Rich Schoolcraft Darrell Sturn John Kneisley George Subject Re FW La Plata to Bloomfield Ben per your request The valves on the lateral were confirmed to be full open Scrubber off the Ignacio lateral located in the Blanco Hub was dry Siphons on meter tube headers down stream of scrubber were also dry Plates on El Paso refer to George Kneisleys email earlier today have been experiencing liquid build up No differential across scrubber into Blanco Hub Forwarded by David RoenschETSEnron on PM Team SanJuan AM To David RoenschET nron cc Subject Re FW La Plata to Bloomfield OLE Object StdOleLink David I did some checking on the Ignacio Lat The Block valve at MP was full open at psig at I then drove back to the tieend at La Maquina And checked the pressure there it was psig I then called Jesse with Gas Control and had him check his screen and it also read From there drove to La MaQuina meter sta and all The manual valves where open and the pressure was the some AT Bloomfield the pressure up stream of the scrubber was and down stream was no DP there we were flowing about mmcf with the back pressure set at At Bloomfield Gas Control can control the flow as well as the pressure on that meter run for North West Are as we call it the check the back pressure changes all the time depending on how much flow El Paso needs I hope this will answer so questions if not fill free to call the station and we will be happy to help Thanks CGaston David Roensch PM To Team SanJuanET nron

to Bloomfield San Juan please review the attached notes below Team Per Bens request verify the full open position of the mainline valve at MP Also verify full open position of the old Northwest block valve feeding the Blanco Hub Please provide an update of your recent findings with regards to liquid build up on the orfice plates at the El Paso delivery Second provide any information that you may have with regards to liquids received off the Igancio lateral at the Blanco Hub Please verify the differential across the inlet scrubber into the Blanco Hub Ben All pressure transmitters are calibrated at a minimum on a monthly basis during customer witness testing so the readings that you are currently monitoring are accurate Also there are no low spot drains or siphons for which to verify liquid buildup other than at the deliveryoutlet points on this system to El Paso and the Blanco Hub San Juan team members Blackie Foutz or Chris Gaston can be contacted for further details on this system Also La Maquina Jack Rabbit are both downstream of the mailine valve at MP The meter station of pipe check and block valve at La Maquina are owned by WFS Also if I remeber correctly the grade covering the of piping from the meter station to the lateral is fairly flat However I could be mistaken as its been awhile since Ive been to that location Forwarded by David RoenschETSEnron on

nronXgate Subject FW La Plata to Bloomfield The continuing deterioration of the efficiencies on the Ignacio line is of grave concern to us Please check the valves around the la MaquinaBloomfield segment to make sure they are fully open lets take pressure readings in that section for recalibration of the segment Lets check for the presence of liquids particularly at the low elevation spots Thx ben Original Message From Choquette Gary Sent Monday December PM To McChane Bob Asante Ben Cc Kneisley George Subject RE La Plata to Bloomfield Bob Researching the drawings for the La Plata to Bloomfield piping et al there is a mainline block valve on the line at approximately mile post between Jack Rabbit and La Maquina From the La Maquina meter station there is of wall pipe The La Maquina station consists of two orifice tubes with a VBall flow control upstream of the meter tubes Each meter tube has ball isolation valves both up and downstream of the orifice element Run switching occurs on run on the upstream side The two tubes common into a header that becomes the line to the Where the ties into the it appears there is a check valve and ball valve From the alignment sheet there appears to be some major elevation changes between the meter station and the pipeline We have a reasonable elevation profile on the line George do you have a site elevation for the La Maquina site Meter number Original Message From McChane Bob Sent Monday December PM To Asante Ben Cc Choquette Gary Subject La Plata to Bloomfield Ben There seems to be a restriction of some sort and a substantial one at that on the Ignacio lateral between the La Maquina input and Bloomfield Using historical and current SCADA data researched by Gary Choquette the pressure loss in this mile segment is on a per mile basis more than twice that experienced in the first miles from La Plata to La Maquina The restriction may be the result of liquids settling into a low spot The question is where would the liquids come from it is hard to imagine the source is the La Plata compressor unitsmaybe from the La Maquina input or it may simply be a pinched valve in that segment Is there a mainline valve in the miles of pipe If there is any hope of getting the flow through the La Plata to Bloomfield segment up to MMcfd the restriction in the La Maquina to Bloomfield segment will have to be addressed and identified I would suggest that a check of any valves within that segment are full open If this is not the cause then take actual calibrated pressure readings from La Plata to Bloomfield to confirm whether or not the problem is real or imagined What are your thoughts Bob
