filled it would signal a likely end to the present short covering rally A higher close on Wednesday would help set the stage for a possible of Mays high crossing at later this month If you can remember it was not until fall that the trade finally realized that too much moisture can cut yields We may be facing the same situation this year meaning that it could be some time before the market finally begins to build in a weather premium because of too much rain in the Midwest which has lowed yield prospects Early calls are for July corn to open cent lower this morning July wheat was lower in overnight trading as it extended this weeks decline due to forecasts calling for improving weather conditions across the plains by early next week Additional pressure is coming from a pick up in
