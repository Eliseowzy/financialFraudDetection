Infol please pass on AT PM FRIDAY THERE WILL BE A MOMENT OF SILENCE IT IS ASKED THAT YOU P LEASE STOP WHAT YOUR DOING AND LIGHT A CANDLE IN MEMORY OF ALL THAT HAVE PA SSED Please pass on TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES This from a Canadian newspaper its worth sharing Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair a Canadian television Commentator What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record America The Good Neighbor This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth Germany Japan and to a lesser extent Britain and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts None of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States When France was in danger of collapsing in it was the Americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris I was there I saw it When earthquakes hit distant cities it is the United States that hurries in to help This spring American communities were flattened by tornadoes Nobody helped The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries Now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent war mongering Americans Id like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet the Lockheed TriStar or the Douglas DC If so why dont they fly them Why do all the International lines except Russia fly American Planes Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon not once but several times and safely home again You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at Even their draftdodgers are not pursued and hounded They are here on our streets and most of them unless they are breaking Canadian laws are getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here When the railways of France Germany and India were breaking down through age it was the Americans who rebuilt them When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke nobody loaned them an old caboose Both are still broke I can name you times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble I dont think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake Our neighbors have faced it alone and Im one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around They will come out of this thing with their flag high And when they do they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles I hope Canada is not one of those Stand proud America Wear it proudly This is one of the best editorials that I have ever read regarding the United States It is nice that one man realizes it I only wish that the rest of the world would realize it We are always blamed for everything and never even get a thank you for the things we do To show the terrorists that we Americans stick together FRIDAY SEPTEMBER is Flags Across America All Americans are asked to display the American flag either in their homes or cars Lets keep the meaning of UNITED in United States Pass it on LETS STAND BEHIND OUR COUNTRY AND DRESS IN OUR COLORS TOMORROW in memory of all those who perished this morning the passengers and the pilots on the United Air and AA flights the

<13248082.1075842003870.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,wayne.vinson@enron.com,2001-08-28 13:43:49,Vacation CalendarPST It appears after looking at the calendar that we need to clarify our vacation policy When the calendar says no one off early that also implies that no one should take vacation There are numerous tasks associated with closing out the prior month and setting up the new month which make those days much busier than the rest of the month It does appear that the last day of the month is not quite as busy as the first day so we will be monitoring it to ascertain the need for everyone on that day however until we make that decision we would like everyone to be here That being said we all understand unanticipated events and pre planned trips can sometimes interfere with your work schedule we just ask that you take the groups workload into account when scheduling your much deserved vacations Another issue that needs to be addressed is the last day of the year and the first business day of the year Absolutely no one can miss these two days due to the extreme work load In addition we would like to give everyone the opportunity to have time off around Christmas or Thanksgiving in order to do this we need to see who needs what days off Please let Casey or I know what your plans are around those holidays Until we know from everyone it will be hard to allow someone to be off for both holidays Please let someone know in the future when you are scheduling days off before you enter them in the vacation folder so we can minimize the issues related to too many people being gone at the same time Also be wary of your vacation balance and remember that according to Enron corporate policy you can only carry over hours of vacation time all remaining vacation time will be lost With that in mind try to schedule your remaining vacation time in the next few weeks so the end of the year doesnt sneakup on you Thank you Donnie Vinson Casey Evans Stacey W White
