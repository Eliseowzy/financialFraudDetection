With respect to your question of whether the financial trader services can be charged at cost or must have a markup I received advice from Chris Catt at PWCSydney last summer that there needed to be a markup for these services Given the skills required by the financial trader and the risk associated with the transactions Chris advised that there needed to be a markup over cost based on a recent ruling by the ATO The ATO issued TR in January which provides a safeharbor for de minimis services that are provided by an Australian company and meet certai n monetary limitations Under the de miminis safe harbor where the costs associated with all services provided by Enron Australia Pty Limited to offshore affiliates do not exceed A in a year the safe harbor markup of may be available Paragraph of the ruling sets forth th e requirements as follows As mentioned in paragraph the Commissioner will apply a similar administrative practice in de minimis cases where the total direct and indirect costs of supplying services to Australian or foreign associated enterprises as appropriate is not more than in a year The practice applies to all intragroup services supplied or acquired where the relevant cost limit is not exceeded Therefore in some cases it might be applicable to all intragroups services both supplied and acquired The transfer prices that must be used and the conditions for their use are th e same as those specified in paragraphs to As for the practice in relation to noncore services all taxpayers in a group must use the same markup for incoming and outgoing services in respect of each foreign jurisdiction but the markup may vary from country to country within the limits described above Example An Australian subsidiary of a foreign based

With respect to your question of whether the financial trader services can be charged at cost or must have a markup I received advice from Chris Catt at PWCSydney last summer that there needed to be a markup for these services Given the skills required by the financial trader and the risk associated with the transactions Chris advised that there needed to be a markup over cost based on a recent ruling by the ATO The ATO issued TR in January which provides a safeharbor for de minimis services that are provided by an Australian company and meet certai n monetary limitations Under the de miminis safe harbor where the costs associated with all services provided by Enron Australia Pty Limited to offshore affiliates do not exceed A in a year the safe harbor markup of may be available Paragraph of the ruling sets forth th e requirements as follows As mentioned in paragraph the Commissioner will apply a similar administrative practice in de minimis cases where the total direct and indirect costs of supplying services to Australian or foreign associated enterprises as appropriate is not more than in a year The practice applies to all intragroup services supplied or acquired where the relevant cost limit is not exceeded Therefore in some cases it might be applicable to all intragroups services both supplied and acquired The transfer prices that must be used and the conditions for their use are th e same as those specified in paragraphs to As for the practice in relation to noncore services all taxpayers in a group must use the same markup for incoming and outgoing services in respect of each foreign jurisdiction but the markup may vary from country to country within the limits described above Example An Australian subsidiary of a foreign based multinational group receives marketing and technical assistance from a foreign associate No other services are acquired by any Australian member of the group from its foreig n associated enterprises The total direct and indirect costs of providing t he services to the Australian subsidiary for the year are As long a s the amount actually charged for the services is not more than or in the circumstances outlined in paragraph the Commissioner would not require the taxpayer to establish an arms length price for th e services Based on discussions we had late last summer we thought that the

McKenzie in Tokyo have indicated that they still have a few open issues to followup on Baker McKenzie have concluded that where an Enron nonTokyo trading office receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty that payment should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax Further they have advised that consumption tax Japans VAT should not apply to financial transactions although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the consumption tax Baker McKenzie have advised that they need to do some followup work with respect to payments from options and from physical contracts as well as some further checking on the tax treaties that Japan has with the countries where our nonJapan trading offices are located I expect to have their response shortly One issue that we are currently pursuing is the Japanese tax consequences of the Enron Japan trading office providing services that benefit the other Enron

Jeff CT Stephen H CT Mark CT Alan CT Debbie R CT Subject Re Enron Online Japan Tax Issues So basically were OK for current plans although credit should be aware of A Dave Susan NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Mario Parra NRON cc Jeff NRON Stephen H CT Mark CT Alan CT David CT Subject Enron Online Japan Tax Issues I received advice today from our outside law firm in Tokyo regarding their final conclusions on the Japanese tax issues relating to the nonJapanese trading offices trading with Japanese counterparties The following is a summary of their advice A Cash Settled Derivatives Transactions Swap Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities standard swaps options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment flows should not be subject to withholding tax However to the extent that Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments concern exists that imput ed interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta x Consumption Tax VAT and Excise Taxes Although Japan imposes a consumption tax VAT financial transactions a re generally not subject to the consumption tax so cash settled derivative transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax Japan imposes various excise taxes some of which apply to commodities that are t he subject to Enron Online transactions such as petroleum excise tax Such excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices Collateral for Derivatives Transactions If Enron entities will take collateral from Japanbased customers in connection with derivative transactions depending upon the specific arrangements withholding tax liability might arise For example if an Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japanbased customer and pays interest on it such interest payments could be subject to local withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer B Physically Settled Transactions Consumption Tax Japan imposes consumption tax VAT on the importation of tangible goods an d on domestic transfers of tangible goods Consumption tax should be applicab le to imports of all physical commodities indicated at the Enron Online websit e including natural gas LNG petroleum and derivatives coal and pulp and paper Consequently commodity contracts for physical settlement should provide that ownership of the commodity will pass outside Japan to the Japanbased customer As owner of the products upon import the Japanbase d customer would act as importer for consumption tax purposes and in that capacity would handle formalities upon import pay import consumption tax a nd then credit or seek a refund for the resulting input consumption tax If instead the title to the commodities is transferred after such commodities enter Japan each Enron entity that sells to Japan would be required to register as a taxpayer for consumption tax purposes pay consumption tax upon import and file consumption tax returns While such a n arrangement is feasible in practice other industries have encountered resistance from customs authorities who administer the import consumption tax system to the designation of a nonresident entity as formal importer Excise Tax Japan imposes an excise tax on the importation and transfer of various commodities including natural gas LNG crude oil and refined petroleum products Petrochemicals may also be subject to excise tax depending upon the specific product Other commodities listed at the website including coal plastics except if a specific product were characterized as a petrochemical subject to excise tax and pulp and paper are not subject t o excise tax Again Enron entities should transfer ownership of commodities before they reach Japan so that the Japanbased customer acts as importer a nd has responsibility for payment of excise taxes C Tax Representations The trading offices considered were those located in the US the UK Singapore Australia Canada Spain and Norway Japan has tax treaties in force with all of these countries Consequently with respect to GTCs entered into with these trading offices the tax payor and payee representations may provide that the counterparty agree and represent that withholding tax will not appl y and will not be deducted from payments it makes to Enron entities and with respect to payments the counterparty will receive from Enron entities it is eligible to claim relief under the business profits article of an applicable tax treaty and does not have a permanent establishment in the paying Enron entitys jurisdiction Please let me know if you have any questions need any additional informati on or would like me to forward our outside advisors memo on this subject t o you Best regards Susan

Below is a summary of the tax advice that I received from our outside advisors in Tokyo and Sydney on the Sydney trading office entering into cas h settled weather derivative trades with Japanese counterparties Japanese Tax Advice Swap Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities standard swaps options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment flows should not be subject to withholding tax However to the extent that Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments concern exists that imput ed interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta x Consumption Tax VAT and Excise Taxes Although Japan imposes a consumption tax VAT financial transactions a re generally not subject

might arise For example if an Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japanbased customer and pays interest on it such interest payments could be subject to local withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer Australian Tax Advice Swap Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions Based on the summaries of the products attached to Justin Timothys June th email to Mario Parra Cardoso and Dale Neuner the swap income or deduction should be recognized on a due and payable basis rather than on an accrual basis over the term of the swap and there should not be any interest withholding tax imposed on the swap payments because there does not appear to be any linkage between the swap payment and interest as defined for Australian tax purposes Note that there is an Australian tax proposal to impose withholding tax on other Australian source income Although no details are yet available it is expected that the Australian government will not impose withholding tax whe re the income would constitute business profits of any entity in a treaty country such as Japan which does not have permanent establishment in Australia Thus based on the current proposal it is unlikely that such a withholding tax if enacted would apply to the swap payments However th is could change depending upon the rules actually enacted GST VAT Effective July the Goods and Services Tax GST will tax at a rate the consumption of most goods and services in Australia It does not apply to consumption outside of Australia eg exports A swap payment to a Japanese counterparty will be GSTfree This means that the Australian trading office would be able to claim refunds on a portion o f the GST paid on its rents and other expenses Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information Best regards Susan

McKenzie in Tokyo have indicated that they still have a few open issues to followup on Baker McKenzie have concluded that where an Enron nonTokyo trading office receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty that payment should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax Further they have advised that consumption tax Japans VAT should not apply to financial transactions although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the consumption tax Baker McKenzie have advised that they need to do some followup work with respect to payments from options and from physical contracts as well as some further checking on the tax treaties that Japan has with the countries where our nonJapan trading offices are located I expect to have their response shortly One issue that we are currently pursuing is the Japanese tax consequences of the Enron Japan trading office providing services that benefit the other Enron

Japans overall effort to extend Enrons crude and products business to Japan It will be marketed to customers as one potential means to meet their risk management requirements Pursuant to our previous

Cc Taylor Mark E Legal Aronowitz Alan Minns David Timothy Justin Niesler Stefan Subject RE EOL New Product JPY denominated WTI Swap Importance High Dear Frank Many thanks for helping out on this Should be pretty straight forward I think because it is not a new product so much as a slightly revised version of an existing product US WTI There has also been a development which makes it even simpler At first the product was going to be WTI which is usually in USD and barrels in JPY and kiloliters but apparently EOL have said kiloliters wont actually work so the only twist is that this product will be in yen and not USD I have therefore amended the documents I sent yesterday so I hope you havent looked at them yet to take the barrel KL conversion language out and to remove the glitch from the Business Day definition in the GTCs Accordingly this email is exhaustive and you can ignore the one I sent yesterday which was at the bottom of Alans email to me I am attaching a number of documents i The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark The memo describes the product generally and how it will work and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative This is FYI only ii iii These are the ii draft product descriptions and iii GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval assuming I still need his approval if you have approved can you confirm this I wonder If you have any questions please let me know Both documents have been prepared based on the product descriptions and the GTCs currently used for the USD WTI product Re the Product Descriptions in addition to those changes to the US WTI product description which were needed to reflect the fact that these products are in yen and not in USD we have used upper case for Business Days because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays and I have incorporated a new definition the relevant Scheduled Trading Date so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure the top half of the product description can be the same for both products despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done days after a different date in the case of the two definitions and only the bottom half will need to change I know this is not a great way to include definitions in an agreement but I am just trying to keep my changes consistent with the current WTI Product Description methodology I have made no changes to the current WTI GTCs I have assumed that when NY law applies to foreign products we dont usually amend the arbitration clause despite the fact that the products are likely to be purchased by nonUS counter parties I am less sure however about the events of default clause The language seems pretty short

today your time provided I hear from you by Tuesday next week this would be fine Re Exchange Rate Sara Shackleton suggested recently that a central bank rate would be better then a Bank of Tokyo

McKenzie in Tokyo have indicated that they still have a few open issues to followup on Baker McKenzie have concluded that where an Enron nonTokyo trading office receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty that payment should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax Further they have advised that consumption tax Japans VAT should not apply to financial transactions although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the consumption tax Baker McKenzie have advised that they need to do some followup work with respect to payments from options and from physical contracts as well as some further checking on the tax treaties that Japan has with the countries where our nonJapan trading offices are located I expect to have their response shortly One issue that we are currently pursuing is the Japanese tax consequences of the Enron Japan trading office providing services that benefit the other Enron trading offices In this case it may be appropriate for Enron Japan to receive a service fee for such services I am in the process of determining to what extent Enron Japan would be providing services

Jeff CT Stephen H CT Mark CT Alan CT Debbie R CT Subject Re Enron Online Japan Tax Issues So basically were OK for current plans although credit should be aware of A Dave Susan NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Mario Parra NRON cc Jeff NRON Stephen H CT Mark CT Alan CT David CT Subject Enron Online Japan Tax Issues I received advice today from our outside law firm in Tokyo regarding their final conclusions on the Japanese tax issues relating to the nonJapanese trading offices trading with Japanese counterparties The following is a summary of their advice A Cash Settled Derivatives Transactions Swap Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities standard swaps options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment flows should not be subject to withholding tax However to the extent that Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments concern exists that imput ed interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta x Consumption Tax VAT and Excise Taxes Although Japan imposes a consumption tax VAT financial transactions a re generally not subject to the consumption tax so cash settled derivative transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax Japan imposes various excise taxes some of which apply to commodities that are t he subject to Enron Online transactions such as petroleum excise tax Such excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices Collateral for Derivatives Transactions If Enron entities will take collateral from Japanbased customers in connection with derivative transactions depending upon the specific arrangements withholding tax liability might arise For example if an Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japanbased customer and pays interest on it such interest payments could be subject to local withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer B Physically Settled Transactions Consumption Tax Japan imposes consumption tax VAT on the importation of tangible goods an d on domestic transfers of tangible goods Consumption tax should be applicab le to imports of all physical commodities indicated at the Enron Online websit e including natural gas LNG petroleum and derivatives coal and pulp and paper Consequently commodity contracts for physical settlement should provide that ownership of the commodity will pass outside Japan to the Japanbased customer As owner of the products upon import the Japanbase d customer would act as importer for consumption tax purposes and in that capacity would handle formalities upon import pay import consumption tax a nd then credit or seek a refund for the resulting input consumption tax If instead the title to the commodities is transferred after such commodities enter Japan each Enron entity that sells to Japan would be required to register as a taxpayer for consumption tax purposes pay consumption tax upon import and file consumption tax returns While such a n arrangement is feasible in practice other industries have encountered resistance from customs authorities who administer the import consumption tax system to the designation of a nonresident entity as formal importer Excise Tax Japan imposes an excise tax on the importation and transfer of various commodities including natural gas LNG crude oil and refined petroleum products Petrochemicals may also be subject to excise tax depending upon the specific product Other commodities listed at the website including coal plastics except if a specific product were characterized as a petrochemical subject to excise tax and pulp and paper are not subject t o excise tax Again Enron entities should transfer ownership of commodities before they reach Japan so that the Japanbased customer acts as importer a nd has responsibility for payment of excise taxes C Tax Representations The trading offices considered were those located in the US the UK Singapore Australia Canada Spain and Norway Japan has tax treaties in force with all of these countries Consequently with respect to GTCs entered into with these trading offices the tax payor and payee representations may provide that the counterparty agree and represent that withholding tax will not appl y and will not be deducted from payments it makes to Enron entities and with respect to payments the counterparty will receive from Enron entities it is eligible to claim relief under the business profits article of an applicable tax treaty and does not have a permanent establishment in the paying Enron entitys jurisdiction Please let me know if you have any questions need any additional informati on or would like me to forward our outside advisors memo on this subject t o you Best regards Susan

Below is a summary of the tax advice that I received from our outside advisors in Tokyo and Sydney on the Sydney trading office entering into cas h settled weather derivative trades with Japanese counterparties Japanese Tax Advice Swap Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities standard swaps options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment flows should not be subject to withholding tax However to the extent that Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments concern exists that imput ed interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta x Consumption Tax VAT and Excise Taxes Although Japan imposes a consumption tax VAT financial transactions a re generally not subject

might arise For example if an Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japanbased customer and pays interest on it such interest payments could be subject to local withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer Australian Tax Advice Swap Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions Based on the summaries of the products attached to Justin Timothys June th email to Mario Parra Cardoso and Dale Neuner the swap income or deduction should be recognized on a due and payable basis rather than on an accrual basis over the term of the swap and there should not be any interest withholding tax imposed on the swap payments because there does not appear to be any linkage between the swap payment and interest as defined for Australian tax purposes Note that there is an Australian tax proposal to impose withholding tax on other Australian source income Although no details are yet available it is expected that the Australian government will not impose withholding tax whe re the income would constitute business profits of any entity in a treaty country such as Japan which does not have permanent establishment in Australia Thus based on the current proposal it is unlikely that such a withholding tax if enacted would apply to the swap payments However th is could change depending upon the rules actually enacted GST VAT Effective July the Goods and Services Tax GST will tax at a rate the consumption of most goods and services in Australia It does not apply to consumption outside of Australia eg exports A swap payment to a Japanese counterparty will be GSTfree This means that the Australian trading office would be able to claim refunds on a portion o f the GST paid on its rents and other expenses Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information Best regards Susan
