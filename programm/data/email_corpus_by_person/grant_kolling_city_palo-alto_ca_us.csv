respect to your modifications to ivb v vi the definition of Act the changes to Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated they are acceptable However at the risk of being a nitpicker the word parties in the language added to the Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated paragraph should read Parties Also on or before the Effective Date it would be appreciated if the City could receive a list of the initial contact staff members of Enron who are located on the trade floor For your information the certified copy of the resolution no adopted March by the city council authorizing the city manager to

dispatch to me If the redline and strikeout changes introductory paragraph ivb v and vi Act Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated could be removed that would be great The City has another inquiry The OFO language on page of Appendix suggests that Enron is not responsible for OFOrelated charges if it doesnt receive properly or timely notice of an OFO condition Is this so Further under what conditions would the City be required to give Enron notice of an OFO Finally EFOs are not addressed in this contract Do the words or other order or notice from a Transporter in the Operational Flow

response It would be nice if the California energy crisis would evaporate the away gas vaporizes under normal atmospheric conditions so that my work load could ease dramatically But no such luck With respect to your modifications to ivb v vi the definition of Act the changes to Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated they are acceptable However at the risk of being a nitpicker the word parties in the language added to the Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated paragraph should read Parties Also on or before the Effective Date it would be appreciated if the City could receive a list of the initial contact staff members of Enron who are located on the trade floor For your information the certified copy of the resolution no adopted March by the city council authorizing the city manager to sign the Enfolio contract will be delivered in the very near future I could fax to you as soon as I get a fax number Please omit the draft resolution and the deleted opinion of counsel in the final dispatch to me If the redline and strikeout changes introductory paragraph ivb v and vi Act Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated could be removed that would be great The City has another inquiry The OFO language on page of Appendix suggests that Enron is not responsible for OFOrelated charges if it doesnt receive properly or timely notice of an OFO condition Is this so Further under what conditions would the City be required to give Enron notice of an OFO Finally EFOs are not addressed in this contract Do the words or other order or notice from a Transporter in the Operational Flow Orders paragraph contemplate EFOs Im optimistic that we can wrap this up pretty soon Look forward to your response to this email Thanks Grant Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday March PM To Cc Subject RE Enfolio Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreement Grant Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries Re ivb I would propose the clause to read b file a petition or otherwise commence authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of creditors or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains undismissed for Days provided if a petition is filed against the Affected Party and the Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be dismissed then such Affected Party shall have an additional Days to effectuate such dismissal Re v and vi or more Gas Days is acceptable I will change the definition of Act as you suggest I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by monbinding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the satisfaction of the parties such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration Is this an acceptable resolution We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into transactions under the contract Our position is that whoever answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company However we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is signed however the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list Of course the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact list Will an initial contact list be acceptable Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above Dan Kolling Grant a To ltocaus cc PM Subject RE Enfolio Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreement Dan please accept my apologies for replying so late I was out of town again and am back at trying to complete days of work within days Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests Let me follow up with a couple of additional inquiries Re iv please suggest language as youve indicated in sentence Anything along the lines youve proposed likely will be agreeable Re v and vi How about days Definition of Act I suggest you refer to Article sections and of the California Constitution to be more specific Section is not regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge though I can see how the language could lead one to cite it In California the concept of binding mediation is not recognized if I have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which Ive participated Mediation is nonbinding As a practical matter it can cost almost as much in terms of time money and effort to proceed to mediation but the rules of engagement are not as tight as are found in arbitration We avoid the rigid procedures I believe Enron should consider this approach at times Having gone through a couple I would not recommend to my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a proposal thats acceptable to the parties The cost of arbitration is not worth it Thats why we in California tend to prefer mediation to arbitration I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list Surely Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to engage in authorized transactions We can do the same Weve had an unfavorable experience with another Texasbased energy company regarding the scope of its representatives authority We dont want to litigate the issue of due authority That list would help Its not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the contract because someone arguably didnt have the authority There are a ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim Thanks Grant Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday March PM To Cc Subject RE Enfolio Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreement File ctrdoc File RESO Enrondoc See attached file ctrdoc Grant I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do not require explanation or clarification Those changes are reflected in the above document Let me go over your list of items I have deleted the word DRAFT I have left a blank for the date within the month of March when the contract would be executed by the City I have changed the word may to shall Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency Default it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a particular point I do not think their is an omission I have added the word reasonable The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise the statement then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration At the point that a Termination Payment calculation is necessary a long drawn out period should not be necessary to attain closure We need to limit the duration to days neither party should be required to wait days before it could accelerate the other partys obligations under the Contract We might be able to add language to extend the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure I have kept the days because days is too short a period During a holiday period one scheduling error could cover the entire period Article has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default extends for more than days during any month The reason is because Enron Corp is the rated entity and no separate rating applies to ENA I have changed a to the I have eliminated the day limitation on the duration of an event of Force Majeure This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points and the language would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a particular party may have caused I think the language is clear as written The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were referenced I am still waiting for your language I started filling it in using language that had been provided by the City I added the word reasonable I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the provision should be more than a partys rating as such I have kept the over prime language These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs to be discussed with that group BBB is considered investment grade and I understand that Enron Corps rating is BBB ENA is not a rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron Corps rating The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to have made If the City cannot make these representations then we need to know that before we execute the Contract I have added the word reasonable The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter should have the legal right to obtain the information based on its contract It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated We can agree to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties I am willing to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list Therefore we object to any listing of approved parties who can transact We believe that each party should be responsible for the actions of its employees and should stand behind any transactions that those parties may enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Contract I will be out of the office on Friday but will be in all next week if you care to discuss any of

can cost almost as much in terms of time money and effort to proceed to mediation but the rules of engagement are not as tight as are found in arbitration We avoid the rigid procedures I believe Enron should consider this approach at times Having gone through a couple I would not recommend to my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a proposal thats acceptable to the parties The cost of arbitration is not worth it Thats why we in California tend to prefer mediation to arbitration I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list Surely Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to engage in authorized transactions We can do the same Weve had an unfavorable experience with another Texasbased energy company regarding the scope of its representatives authority We dont want to litigate the issue of due authority That list would help Its not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the contract because

Termination Payment calculation is necessary a long drawn out period should not be necessary to attain closure We need to limit the duration to days neither party should be required to wait days before it could accelerate the other partys obligations under the Contract We might be able to add language to extend the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure I have kept the days because days is too short a period During a holiday period one scheduling error could cover the entire period Article has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default extends for more than days during any month The reason is because Enron Corp is the rated entity and no separate rating applies to ENA I have changed a to the I have eliminated the day limitation on the duration of an event of Force Majeure This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points and the language would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a

amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs to be discussed with that group BBB is considered investment grade and I understand that Enron Corps rating is BBB ENA is not a rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron Corps rating The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to

by the City I added the word reasonable I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the provision should be more than a partys rating as such I have kept the over prime language These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs to be discussed with that group BBB is considered investment grade and I understand that Enron Corps rating is BBB ENA is not a rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron Corps rating The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the requirements relating

DRAFT above the title of the Enfolio agreement which should be deleted The introductory paragraph line should not contain the words st of January It should be left blank until the parties have signed the contract Otherwise the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the contract because Article section requires the City to proffer the tobeapprovedbyCouncil resolution as of Article Section line The City Customer wants Enron Company to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction as defined Therefore the City requests the word may should be changed to shall Article Sections and first sentence Buyers Requested Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ Sellers failure to Schedule the Buyers Requested Quantity shall constitute a Sellers Deficiency Default How does a Maximum Daily Delivery

the determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared Its unclear whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination before a dispute is referred to arbitration The City should be entitled to receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is obligated to pay the Termination Payment Please clarify or permit the City to exercise these rights Section iv specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a bankruptcy petition is undismissed within days Is this under bankruptcy laws the minimum period of time within which one may seek dismissal of a bankruptcy petition Please refer to the USC section that backs up this provision or change to days Section v and vi Please change days to days The City is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron Section ix this language discusses a default by Enron Corp ENAs parent but no mention is made of ENAs default in this regard Please explain Section line Is a Company supposed to refer to the Company Article The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision as drafted It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event earthquake would prevent either or both parties from performing with the day period stated therein There is no such limitation under California law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary Article Section Could Enron translate the last sentence We dont understand it Appendix Act Please explain why Section is referred to Appendix Claims line Please add

response It would be nice if the California energy crisis would evaporate the away gas vaporizes under normal atmospheric conditions so that my work load could ease dramatically But no such luck With respect to your modifications to ivb v vi the definition of Act the changes to Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated they are acceptable However at the risk of being a nitpicker the word parties in the language added to the Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated paragraph should read Parties Also on or before the Effective Date it would be appreciated if the City could receive a list of the initial contact staff members of Enron who are located on the trade floor For your information the certified copy of the resolution no adopted March by the city council authorizing the city manager to sign the Enfolio contract will be delivered in the very near future I could fax to you as soon as I get a fax number Please omit the draft resolution and the deleted opinion of counsel in the final dispatch to me If the redline and strikeout changes introductory paragraph ivb v and vi Act Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated could be removed that would be great The City has another inquiry The OFO language on page of Appendix suggests that Enron is not responsible for OFOrelated charges if it doesnt receive properly or timely notice of an OFO condition Is this so Further under what conditions would the City be required to give Enron notice of an OFO Finally EFOs are not addressed in this contract Do the words or other order or notice from a Transporter in the Operational Flow Orders paragraph contemplate EFOs Im optimistic that we can wrap this up pretty soon Look forward to your response to this email Thanks Grant Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday March PM To Cc Subject RE Enfolio Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreement Grant Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries Re ivb I would propose the clause to read b file a petition or otherwise

the other party with reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be dismissed then such Affected Party shall have an additional Days to effectuate such dismissal Re v and vi or more Gas Days is acceptable I will change the definition of Act as you suggest I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by monbinding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the satisfaction of the parties such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration Is this an acceptable resolution We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into transactions under the contract Our position is that whoever answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company However we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is signed however the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list Of course the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact list Will an initial contact list be acceptable Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above Dan Kolling Grant a To ltocaus cc PM Subject RE Enfolio

our requests Let me follow up with a couple of additional inquiries Re iv please suggest language as youve indicated in sentence Anything along the lines youve proposed likely will be agreeable Re v and vi How about days Definition of Act I suggest you refer to Article sections and of the California Constitution to be more specific Section is not regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge though I can see how the language could lead one to cite it In California the concept of binding mediation is not recognized if I have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which Ive participated Mediation is nonbinding As a practical matter it can cost almost as much in terms of time money and effort to proceed to mediation but the rules of engagement are not as tight as are found in arbitration We avoid the rigid procedures I believe Enron should consider this approach at times Having gone through a couple I would not recommend to my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a proposal thats acceptable to the parties The cost of arbitration is not worth it Thats why we in California tend to prefer mediation to arbitration I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list Surely Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to engage in authorized transactions We can do the same Weve had an unfavorable experience with another Texasbased energy company regarding the scope of its representatives authority We dont want to litigate the issue of due authority That list would help Its not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the contract because someone arguably didnt have the authority There are a ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make

statement then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration At the point that a Termination Payment calculation is necessary a long drawn out period should not be necessary to attain closure We need to limit the duration to days neither party should be required to wait days before it could accelerate the other partys obligations under the Contract We might be able to add language to extend the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure I have kept the days because days is too short a period During a holiday period one scheduling error could cover the entire period Article has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default extends for more than days during any month The reason is because Enron Corp is the rated entity and no separate rating applies to ENA I have changed a to the I have eliminated the day limitation on

response It would be nice if the California energy crisis would evaporate the away gas vaporizes under normal atmospheric conditions so that my work load could ease dramatically But no such luck With respect to your modifications to ivb v vi the definition of Act the changes to Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated they are acceptable However at the risk of being a nitpicker the word parties in the language added to the Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated paragraph should read Parties Also on or before the Effective Date it would be appreciated if the City could receive a list of the initial contact staff members of Enron who are located on the trade floor For your information the certified copy of the resolution no adopted March by the city council authorizing the city manager to sign the Enfolio contract will be delivered in the very near future I could fax to you as soon as I get a fax number Please omit the draft resolution and the deleted opinion of counsel in the final dispatch to me If the redline and strikeout changes introductory paragraph ivb v and vi Act Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated could be removed that would be great The City has another inquiry The OFO language on page of Appendix suggests that Enron is not responsible for OFOrelated charges if it doesnt receive properly or timely notice of an OFO condition Is this so Further under what conditions would the City be required to give Enron notice of an OFO Finally EFOs are not addressed in this contract Do the words or other order or notice from a Transporter in the Operational Flow Orders paragraph contemplate EFOs Im optimistic that we can wrap this up pretty soon Look forward to your response to this email Thanks Grant Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday March PM To Cc Subject RE Enfolio Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreement Grant Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries Re ivb I would propose the clause to read b file a petition or otherwise commence authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of creditors or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains undismissed for Days provided if a petition is filed against the Affected Party and the Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be dismissed then such Affected Party shall have an additional Days to effectuate such dismissal Re v and vi or more Gas Days is acceptable I will change the definition of Act as you suggest I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by monbinding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the satisfaction of the parties such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration Is this an acceptable resolution We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into transactions under the contract Our position is that whoever answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company However we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is signed however the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list Of course the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact list Will an initial contact list be acceptable Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above Dan Kolling Grant a To ltocaus cc PM Subject RE Enfolio Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreement Dan please accept my apologies for replying so late I was out of town again and am back at trying to complete days of work within days Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests Let me follow up with a couple of additional inquiries Re iv please suggest language as youve indicated in sentence Anything along the lines youve proposed likely will be agreeable Re v and vi How about days Definition of Act I suggest you refer to Article sections and of the California Constitution to be more specific Section is not regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge though I can see how the language could lead one to cite it In California the concept of binding mediation is not recognized if I have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which Ive participated Mediation is nonbinding As a practical matter it can cost almost as much in terms of time money and effort to proceed to mediation but the rules of engagement are not as tight as are found in arbitration We avoid the rigid procedures I believe Enron should consider this approach at times Having gone through a couple I would not recommend to my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a proposal thats acceptable to the parties The cost of arbitration is not worth it Thats why we in California tend to prefer mediation to arbitration I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list Surely Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to engage in authorized transactions We can do the same Weve had an unfavorable experience with another Texasbased energy company regarding the scope of its representatives authority We dont want to litigate the issue of due authority That list would help Its not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the contract because someone arguably didnt have the authority There are a ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make

Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency Default it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a particular point I do not think their is an omission I have added the word reasonable The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise the statement then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration At the point that a Termination Payment calculation is necessary a long drawn out period should not be necessary to attain closure We need to limit the duration to days neither party should be required to wait days before it could accelerate the other partys obligations under the Contract We might be able to add language to extend the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure I have kept the days because days is too short a period During a holiday period one scheduling error could cover the entire period Article has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default extends for more than days during any month The reason is because Enron Corp is the rated entity and no separate rating applies to ENA I have changed a to the I have eliminated the day limitation on the duration of an event of Force Majeure This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points and the language would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a particular party may have caused I think the language is clear as written The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were referenced I am still waiting for your language I started filling it in using language that had been provided by the City I added the word reasonable I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the provision should be more than a partys rating as such I have kept the over prime language These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs to be discussed with that group BBB is considered investment grade and I understand that Enron Corps rating is BBB ENA is not a rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron Corps rating The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the requirements relating

exhibits There is the word DRAFT above the title of the Enfolio agreement which should be deleted The introductory paragraph line should not contain the words st of January It should be left blank until the parties have signed the contract Otherwise the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the contract because Article section requires the City to proffer the tobeapprovedbyCouncil resolution as of Article Section line The City Customer wants Enron Company to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction as defined Therefore the City requests the word may should be changed to shall Article Sections and first sentence Buyers Requested Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ Sellers failure to Schedule the Buyers Requested Quantity shall constitute a Sellers Deficiency Default How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Sellers Deficiency Default if the Buyers Requested Quantity does not include a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity What is the reason for the omission Article Section lines and Line refers to reasonable attorneys fees yet line refers to attorneys fees To be internally consistent line should say reasonable attorneys fees Section right hand column lines A statement showing the determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared Its unclear whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination before a dispute is referred to arbitration The City should be entitled to receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is obligated to pay the Termination Payment Please clarify or permit the City to exercise these rights Section iv specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a bankruptcy petition is undismissed within days Is this under bankruptcy laws the minimum period of time within which one may seek dismissal of a bankruptcy petition Please refer to the USC section that backs up this provision or change to days Section v and vi Please change days to days The City is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron Section ix this language discusses a default by Enron Corp ENAs parent but no mention is made of ENAs default in this regard Please explain Section line Is a Company supposed to refer to the Company Article The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision as drafted It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event earthquake would prevent either or both parties from performing with the day period stated therein There is no such limitation under California law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary Article Section Could Enron translate the last sentence We dont understand it Appendix Act Please explain why Section is referred to Appendix Claims line Please add reasonable before attorneys fees Appendix GAAP This should read GAAP means generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied with respect to Company and governmental generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied with respect to Customer Appendix Interest Rate Please delete two percent over The City has a AAA bond rating therefore the City believes the over prime should not apply to it Appendix Material Adverse Change What does Enron believe the Citys Net Worth to be The million threshold is mentioned Also what is ENAs bond rating Is BBB an investment grade rating Representations and Warranties Because we have agreed that the opinion of counsel will not be required the reps and warranties are being deleted But the Representations and Warranties is nevertheless included in the agreement Item i should be deleted because the City has not undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an opinion We would like to delete and vii it is not Party Operational Flow Orders line Please add reasonable before attorneys fees Financial Matters line What is meant by to the extent it has a legal right of access thereto andor etc Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated We do not as a matter of legal policy agree to arbitration but we will mediate disputes Is Enron amenable to mediation This process is less formal and less costly in my opinion Authority for Transactions Staff would like the Agreement to include a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on behalf of their employers Could a statement be added to this section to this effect Then we could attach the lists as an Exhibit C Thank you so much for considering these issues There are others which
