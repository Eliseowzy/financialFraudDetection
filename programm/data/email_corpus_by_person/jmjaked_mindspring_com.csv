little ones on Halloween for sure FYII too am skeptical regarding this kind of stuff My usual reaction is to check out wwwsnopescom for information on the validity of certain claims I checked all over their site and couldnt find anything so I contacted them asking if they had any additional information regarding this LeAnn D Martinson Executive Assistant FabTech Inc Document link Leann Martinson FYI I was very skeptical of this email so I called the telephone number and it really was Laura Katsis at work She said that she did write and send the email in reaction to what her girlfriend told her This could still be a hoax but I am taking it a little more seriously knowing that Laura is a real person who admits writing the email and who stands behind what she wrote Lisa Kent To Fabtech All cc PM Subject FW Malls on Original Message From Behrens Chris mailto oltcom Sent Friday October PM To Behrens Chris Subject FW Malls on Hi All I think you all know that I dont send out hoaxes and dont do the reactionary thing and send out anything that crosses my path This one however is a friend of a friend and Ive given it enough credibility in my mind that Im writing it up and sending it out to all of you My friends friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago She had a date with him around and was stood up She was understandably upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied On she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like that The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any commercial airlines on and to not to go any malls on Halloween As soon as everything happened on the th she called the FBI and has since turned over the letter This is not an email that Ive received and decided to pass on This came from a phone conversation with a longtime friend of mine last night I may be wrong and I hope I am However with one of his warnings being correct and devastating Im not willing to take the chance on the second and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information that I did Laura Katsis Implementation

Cindy Williams from the Laverne and Shirley TV show wrote a piece for the Washington Times denouncing the pay raises coming service members way this year citing that the stated wage gap was bogus A young airman from Hill AFB responds to her article below He ought to get a bonus for this Ms Williams I just had the pleasure of reading your column of Nov Our GIs earn enough and I am a bit confused Frankly Im wondering where this vaunted overpayment is going because as far as I can tell it disappears every month between DFAS The Defense Finance and Accounting Service and my bank account Checking my latest leave and earnings statement LES I see that I make before taxes After taxes I take home When I run that through Windows Calculator I come up with an annual salary of before taxes and after I work in the Air Force Network Control Center AFNCC where I am part of the team responsible for the administration of a host computer network I am involved with infrastructure segments specifically with Cisco Systems equipment A quick check under jobs for Network Technicians in the Washington DC area reveals a position in my career field requiring three years experience with my job Amazingly this job does NOT pay a year nor does it pay less than this No this job is being offered at to per annum Im sure you can draw the obvious conclusions Also you tout increases to Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic Allowance for Subsistence housing and food allowances respectively as being a further boon to an already overcompensated force Again Im curious as to where this money has gone as BAH and BAS were both slashed in the Hill AFB area effective in January Given the tenor of your column I would assume that you have NEVER had the pleasure of serving your country in her armed forces Before you take it upon yourself to once more castigate congressional and DOD leadership for attempting to get the families in the militarys lowest pay brackets off AFDC WIC and food stamps I suggest that you join a group of deploying soldiers headed for AFGHANISTAN I leave the choice of service branch up to you Whatever choice you make though opt for the SIX month rotation it will guarantee you the longest possible time away from your family and friends thus giving you full deployment experience As your group prepares to board the plane make sure to note the spouses and children who are saying goodbye to their loved ones Also take care to note that several families are still unsure of how theyll be able to mak e ends meet while the primary breadwinner is gone obviously theyve been squandering the vast piles of cash the DOD has been giving them Try to deploy over a major holiday Christmas and Thanksgiving are perennial favorites And when youre actually over there sitting in a DFP Defensive Fire Position the modernday foxhole shivering against the cold desert night and the flight sergeant tells you that there arent enough people on shift to relieve you for chow Remember this trade whatever MRE mealreadytoeat you manage to get for the tuna noodle casserole or cheese tortellini and add Tabasco to everything this gives some flavor Talk to your loved ones as often as you are permitted it wont nearly be long enough or often enough but take what you can get and be thankful for it You may have picked up on the fact that I disagree with most of the points you present in your oped piece But tomorrow from KABUL I will defend to the death your right to say it You see I am an American fighting man a guarantor of your First Amendment rights and every other right you cherish On a daily basis my brother and sister soldiers worldwide ensure that you and people like you can thumb your collective nose at us all on a salary that is nothing short of pitiful and under conditions that would make most people cringe We hemorrhage our best and brightest into the private sector because we cant offer the stability and pay of civilian companies And you Ms Williams have the gall to say that we make more than we deserve Rubbish AC Michael Bragg Hill AFB AFNCC IF YOU AGREE PLEASE PASS THIS ALONG TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AND SHOW OUR SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN FIGHTING MEN AND WOMEN THANK YOU THIS LETTER SHOULD BE APPLAUDED BY ANYONE WHOS EVER SERVED OR HAD A FAMILY MEMBER SERVE IN THE ARMED FORCES
