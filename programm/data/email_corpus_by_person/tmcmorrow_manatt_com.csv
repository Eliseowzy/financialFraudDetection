AGREEMENT WITH SDGE SEMPRA ENERGY Per Customer Balloon Payment Eliminated No Additional Rate Increases Required to Pay Off Undercollection SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today announced an agreement with San Diego Gas Electric and the utilitys parent company Sempra Energy that will erase a million balloon payment facing the utilitys three million customers The balloon is burst Governor Davis said Under this agreement the undercollection is eliminated without any increase in rates This is a massive benefit to the San Diegans the first Californians to bear the brunt of our states energy crisis last summer The Memorandum of Understanding MOU signed by the Department of Water Resources for Gov Davis with Sempra Energy and SDGE executives while a group of San Diego ratepayers and State Senators Steve Peace DEl Cajon and Dede Alpert DCoronado looked on includes a number of provisions to eliminate the undercollection that could have cost each customer approximately as much as for each residential customer for each smallcommercial customer and for each mediumsized commercial customer In addition it would settle several regulatory cases before the California Public Utilities Commission PUC gives the State the opportunity to purchase acres of environmentallysensitive lands owned by the company along the Colorado River and provides belowmarket power to the State through December from the San Onofre nuclear power plant The regulatory provisions are subject to PUC approval It also calls for the purchase of SDGEs transmission lines for approximately billion or times book value However the deal is not contingent on that purchase of SDGEs transmission network which includes electric lines exceeding kilovolts in capacity and spans approximately circuit miles from southern Orange County to the Mexican border The system also includes about electric substations and transmission interties with Southern California Edisons system at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station Throughout these long and complex negotiations Governor Davis and we have had the mutual objective of reducing the financial impact of Californias crisis on SDGEs customers and helping the State gain more control over its energy destiny said Stephen L Baum chairman president and chief executive officer of Sempra Energy Todays agreement represents a winning proposition for our customers the State and our company it reduces the future financial burden on our customers protects the States economic future and creates a clear path for future growth and profitability for our company Going forward we are committed to working with Governor Davis and the State to implement his recovery plan The MOU signed today is the second with Californias investorowned utilities An agreement with Southern California Edison is pending approval before the State Legislature Unlike the Edison agreement however the MOU with Sempra Energy does not need legislative approval except for the acquisition of transmission lines This is an example of the good that can come when parties are responsible and remain at the bargaining table Governor Davis said This is a balanced business transaction that benefits ratepayers and provides a stable environment for the States third largest utility Governor Davis said the MOU will not result in any additional electricbaserate increases for SDGE customers to recover the million undercollection Without the MOU future balloon payments to recover this sum could have been as much as per customer The regulatory balancing account for SDGEs undercollected power costs had grown to approximately million since September when the State imposed a retail rate cap of cents per kilowatthour retroactive to May California state law AB signed by Governor Davis last year provided for SDGEs recovery of all its prudently incurred power costs but delegated responsibility to the PUC for determining the method and timeline for recovery The agreement includes a complex package of elements to eliminate the balloon payment such as the settlement of the reasonablenessreview case SDGE had with the PUC To settle that case the utility has agreed to forego collecting million of the balancing account In addition the agreement notes that SDGE agrees to give back percent of the profits on two longterm power contracts earned since the energy crisis flared last June That means SDGE will forego collecting another million in the balancing account The California Department of Water Resources will purchase those contracts as of June SDGE and its sister utility SoCalGas will invest at least billion over six years into capital improvements In addition if the State decides not buy the transmission lines and SDGE builds the Valley Rainbow line the utility backed by Sempra Energy will put another million into transmission line improvements subject to PUC approval Excluding the transmission system improvements this is an increase of million more than the utilities invested in capital improvements in the previous five years and SDGE will drop all legal claims against the State We know that many of our customers are extremely concerned about the potential of large balloon payments looming in the future to address our past undercollections said Edwin A Guiles group president of Sempra Energys regulated business units and chairman of SDGE We are pleased that todays agreement provides the framework to resolve major regulatory issues to the benefit of our customers Many challenges remain but this agreement demonstrates that by working together we can surmount these challenges in a way that benefits all the key stakeholders in Californias energy future The MOU also calls for the Department of Water Resources DWR to continue to buy power for SDGE through the agency until certain conditions are met DWR has been purchasing power for SDGE customers since early February SDGE is a regulated utility operating in San Diego and southern Orange counties Sempra Energy NYSE SRE based in San Diego is a Fortune energy services holding company with annualized revenues of about billion Through its eight principal subsidiaries Southern California Gas Company San Diego Gas Electric Sempra Energy Solutions Sempra Energy Trading Sempra Energy International Sempra Energy Resources Sempra Communications and Sempra Energy Financial the Sempra Energy companies employees serve more than nine million customers in the United States Europe Canada Mexico South America and Asia

for The Utility Reform Network Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association said large business users were offering to pay off the back debt of Southern California Edison estimated at billion in exchange for direct access I thought we were making a lot of progress until the information on the contracts came out Stewart said We really dont have a way of dealing with those contracts Now Stewart is suggesting that direct access be slowly phased in over a period of years and that the longterm power contracts be renegotiated perhaps with some being switched from

to power purchased for utility customers by the state Many large and small California businesses have seen their electric bills double says a newspaper ad being run by the coalition this week These cost increases are a burden that will cause consumer prices to increase some businesses to fail and jobs to be lost A rate increase approved by the state Public Utilities Commission for PGE and Edison customers in May fell heaviest on business users The PUC said that the average residential increase was about percent while the average business increase was about percent Legislation that authorized the state to begin buying power in January for the utilities who were crippled by a failed deregulation plan bars rate increases for residential customers who use up to percent of the baseline the minimal amount deemed necessary for a household Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton DSan Francisco and other legislators have argued that large businesses should bear most of the burden of the failed deregulation plan because it was business not residential consumers who pushed for deregulation Alan Zaremberg president of the California Chamber of Commerce said that forcing businesses to bear a disproportionate rate increase will cost everyone through higher prices for goods and services and possibly a loss of jobs If government didnt allow implementation of deregulation in the right manner Zaremberg said then we all have to find a solution We are all in this together and thats residential and business alike The legislation that authorized the state to buy power also directed the PUC to ban direct access power purchases if the loss of rate revenue from the departing customers would harm the ability to pay off a power bond The state plans to issue a bond of up to billion in September or October to repay the taxpayersupported state general fund for power purchases The bond would be paid off by ratepayers over years Last week the Senate rejected a bill by Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey on a vote that would have allowed businesses to shop for power if they paid an exit fee to protect the bond payments Business groups said the fee was too large and would not result in lower power costs I cannot carry a directaccess bill that makes it harder to sell the bonds or that shifts costs from large users who leave for cheaper power to smaller users and residential ratepayers Bowen said Burton and Bowen have both criticized Gov Gray Davis plan to keep Southern California Edison from joining Pacific Gas and Electric in bankruptcy They say the plan which includes the state purchase of the Edison transmission system is too generous to Edison Both Burton and Bowen have suggested that an Edison bankruptcy may not be a calamity But in the Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg DVan Nuys launched a drive for an alternative Edison rescue plan that was based on gaining business support by offering direct access Hertzberg asked a former Democratic assemblyman Phil Isenberg of Sacramento to try to work out an agreement among the various special interest groups business labor consumers and generators The basic plan considered by the Isenberg group would have left core customers residences and small businesses in a regulated system receiving power at stable prices from the generators and contracts retained by the utilities Businesses and other large users the noncore customers would be free to shop around for lowcost power by if they agreed to help pay off the Edison debt The Edison rate increase for large users would be limited to percent The PUC would create a balancing account to track costs issuing a refund if too much was collected or raising rates if revenue fell short Business and generator groups told Hertzberg last week that they reached agreement on a general framework with the exception of the state purchase of the Edison transmission system and some other issues But the consumer and labor representatives opposed the framework Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network said in a dissenting statement that an acrosstheboard allocation of state power costs would be clearly unfair and cause residential users to subsidize directaccess customers Hertzberg said he is considering some of the ideas in the framework presented by the Isenberg group and may make a proposal in a week or two We are looking at all the possibilities Hertzberg said We are trying to do some form of direct access within the current contract structure
