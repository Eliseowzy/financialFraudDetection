<281646.1075855588319.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,nytdirect@nytimes.com,2001-05-11 21:13:00,Todays Headlines from NYTimescomHEADLINES The New York Times on the Web Saturday May For news updated throughout the day visit wwwnytimescom QUOTE OF THE DAY WASHINGTON May President Bush said today that the surest and swiftest way to help Americans cope with rising gas and oil prices was to enact a sweeping tax cut which he said would give them more money to pay for the increases If I had my way Id have it in place tomorrow so that people would have money in their pockets to deal with high energy prices Mr Bush said at news conference in the White House The Congress needs to act Mr Bushs comments came a day after the Senate like the House approved a budget plan that calls for trillion in tax cuts over the next years and Mr Bush sought to seize that momentum urging both chambers of Congress to pass the tax cut itself before their Memorial Day recess Mr Bush also sought to link his push for a tax cut to the nations energy woes more strongly than ever before He cited those woes as a rationale for a reduction in taxes and he cited a tax cut as an answer to those woes After several weeks in which administration officials had cautioned Americans that there was little if anything that their energy policy to be unveiled on Thursday could do to help consumers in the short term Mr Bush today pitched his tax cut as in fact a readymade remedy And he did so at a time of growing worry among Republicans that rising gas and oil prices could seriously damage his presidency Let me say it again see if I can be more clear the president said in response to one of many questions about other approaches to dealing with energy problems To the Congress who is interested in helping consumers pay high gas prices Pass the tax relief as quickly as possible Weve set aside billion to help consumers with high energy prices Mr Bush continued referring to a part of the suggested tax cut that would be distributed among taxpayers this year Thats the quickest way to help consumers I am deeply concerned about consumers Im deeply concerned about high gas prices To anybody who wants to figure out how to help the consumers pass the tax relief package as quickly as possible Many lowincome people who are least able to afford a steep escalation in the cost of cooling their homes or filling their cars would receive only modest amounts of money from the tax cut Mr Bush has proposed Beyond that the poorest of these people who pay no taxes may not receive any financial relief at all from a tax cut But Mr Bush and his advisers clearly craved an opportunity for the president to appear empathetic and in charge of the situation amid predictions by some analysts that the price of a gallon of gas could reach this summer Todays news conference which was almost minutes long was the third in the White House the president had held since his inauguration nearly four months ago Mr Bush also wanted to claim victory for the Congressional passage of a budget plan with a tax cut only slightly smaller than the one he initially proposed And he expressed support for Attorney General John Ashcrofts decision announced shortly before Mr Bush spoke to delay until June the planned execution of Timothy J McVeigh He is lucky to be an American Mr Bush said of Mr McVeigh This is a country that will bend over backwards to make sure that his constitutional rights are guaranteed as opposed to rushing his fate The president added that the failure of FBI officials to turn over documents to which Mr McVeighs defense lawyers were entitled had neither persuaded him that Mr McVeigh was unjustly convicted nor shaken his faith in the fairness with which the death penalty is meted out As the governor of Texas Mr Bush presided over more than executions in six years Asked about the recent expulsion of the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Commission Mr Bush grew more animated than usual his anger evident The decision was an outrageous decision he said To me it undermines the whole credibility of this commission Like Mr Bushs two previous White House news conferences this one was announced only shortly before it began and Mr Bush for a third time eschewed the formal trappings of the East Room for the less formal press briefing room He seemed determined to maintain a jocular demeanor even about grave subjects smiling and laughing for a moment before answering a question about a monthold Palestinian baby killed by Israeli fire this week The issue he discussed most was energy as he set the stage for his administrations announcement of its policy one that will call for the construction of power plants and more oil and gas exploration on federal lands Many voters are concerned about the environmental repercussions of such measures and Mr Bush sought both to address those concerns and to assert that energy problems were long in the making and would be long in the solving This is a situation thats been developing over the years and its going to take a while to correct Mr Bush said presenting himself as the blunt bearer of mixed tidings and later adding Im going to tell the truth when it comes to energy that we have a serious problem that we need to do a couple of things We need to be more conservation minded in America he said But Im also going to say as plainly as I can we wont conserve our way to energy independence We must also increase supply Mr Bushs discussion of the nations energy problems in some ways mirrored his evaluations of the economy in which he has gone out of his way to document that he inherited a troubling situation He said today that he hoped an economic recovery would be imminent but that theres no question that the minute I got elected the storm clouds on the horizon were getting nearly directly overhead Full Story NATIONAL Ashcroft Delays Death of McVeigh Over FBIs Lapse nationalEXEChtml The West Is Culling Forests That

<17243780.1075855605340.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,nytdirect@nytimes.com,2001-05-11 21:13:00,Todays Headlines from NYTimescomHEADLINES The New York Times on the Web Saturday May For news updated throughout the day visit wwwnytimescom QUOTE OF THE DAY WASHINGTON May President Bush said today that the surest and swiftest way to help Americans cope with rising gas and oil prices was to enact a sweeping tax cut which he said would give them more money to pay for the increases If I had my way Id have it in place tomorrow so that people would have money in their pockets to deal with high energy prices Mr Bush said at news conference in the White House The Congress needs to act Mr Bushs comments came a day after the Senate like the House approved a budget plan that calls for trillion in tax cuts over the next years and Mr Bush sought to seize that momentum urging both chambers of Congress to pass the tax cut itself before their Memorial Day recess Mr Bush also sought to link his push for a tax cut to the nations energy woes more strongly than ever before He cited those woes as a rationale for a reduction in taxes and he cited a tax cut as an answer to those woes After several weeks in which administration officials had cautioned Americans that there was little if anything that their energy policy to be unveiled on Thursday could do to help consumers in the short term Mr Bush today pitched his tax cut as in fact a readymade remedy And he did so at a time of growing worry among Republicans that rising gas and oil prices could seriously damage his presidency Let me say it again see if I can be more clear the president said in response to one of many questions about other approaches to dealing with energy problems To the Congress who is interested in helping consumers pay high gas prices Pass the tax relief as quickly as possible Weve set aside billion to help consumers with high energy prices Mr Bush continued referring to a part of the suggested tax cut that would be distributed among taxpayers this year Thats the quickest way to help consumers I am deeply concerned about consumers Im deeply concerned about high gas prices To anybody who wants to figure out how to help the consumers pass the tax relief package as quickly as possible Many lowincome people who are least able to afford a steep escalation in the cost of cooling their homes or filling their cars would receive only modest amounts of money from the tax cut Mr Bush has proposed Beyond that the poorest of these people who pay no taxes may not receive any financial relief at all from a tax cut But Mr Bush and his advisers clearly craved an opportunity for the president to appear empathetic and in charge of the situation amid predictions by some analysts that the price of a gallon of gas could reach this summer Todays news conference which was almost minutes long was the third in the White House the president had held since his inauguration nearly four months ago Mr Bush also wanted to claim victory for the Congressional passage of a budget plan with a tax cut only slightly smaller than the one he initially proposed And he expressed support for Attorney General John Ashcrofts decision announced shortly before Mr Bush spoke to delay until June the planned execution of Timothy J McVeigh He is lucky to be an American Mr Bush said of Mr McVeigh This is a country that will bend over backwards to make sure that his constitutional rights are guaranteed as opposed to rushing his fate The president added that the failure of FBI officials to turn over documents to which Mr McVeighs defense lawyers were entitled had neither persuaded him that Mr McVeigh was unjustly convicted nor shaken his faith in the fairness with which the death penalty is meted out As the governor of Texas Mr Bush presided over more than executions in six years Asked about the recent expulsion of the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Commission Mr Bush grew more animated than usual his anger evident The decision was an outrageous decision he said To me it undermines the whole credibility of this commission Like Mr Bushs two previous White House news conferences this one was announced only shortly before it began and Mr Bush for a third time eschewed the formal trappings of the East Room for the less formal press briefing room He seemed determined to maintain a jocular demeanor even about grave subjects smiling and laughing for a moment before answering a question about a monthold Palestinian baby killed by Israeli fire this week The issue he discussed most was energy as he set the stage for his administrations announcement of its policy one that will call for the construction of power plants and more oil and gas exploration on federal lands Many voters are concerned about the environmental repercussions of such measures and Mr Bush sought both to address those concerns and to assert that energy problems were long in the making and would be long in the solving This is a situation thats been developing over the years and its going to take a while to correct Mr Bush said presenting himself as the blunt bearer of mixed tidings and later adding Im going to tell the truth when it comes to energy that we have a serious problem that we need to do a couple of things We need to be more conservation minded in America he said But Im also going to say as plainly as I can we wont conserve our way to energy independence We must also increase supply Mr Bushs discussion of the nations energy problems in some ways mirrored his evaluations of the economy in which he has gone out of his way to document that he inherited a troubling situation He said today that he hoped an economic recovery would be imminent but that theres no question that the minute I

to the nations energy woes more strongly than ever before He cited those woes as a rationale for a reduction in taxes and he cited a tax cut as an answer to those woes After several weeks in which administration officials had cautioned Americans that there was little if anything that their energy policy to be unveiled on Thursday could do to help consumers in the short term Mr Bush today pitched his tax cut as in fact a readymade remedy And he did so at a time of growing worry among Republicans that rising gas and oil prices could seriously damage his presidency Let me say it again see if I can be more clear the president said in response to one of many questions about other approaches to dealing with energy problems To the Congress who is interested in helping consumers pay high gas prices Pass the tax relief as quickly as possible Weve set aside billion to help consumers with high energy prices Mr Bush continued referring to a part of the suggested tax cut that would be distributed among taxpayers this year Thats the quickest way to help consumers I am deeply concerned about consumers Im deeply concerned about high gas prices To anybody who wants to figure out how to help the consumers pass the tax relief package as quickly as possible Many lowincome people who are least able to afford a steep escalation in the cost of cooling their homes or filling their cars would receive only modest amounts of money from the tax cut Mr Bush has proposed Beyond that the poorest of these people who pay no taxes may not receive any financial relief at all from a tax cut But Mr Bush and his advisers clearly craved an opportunity for the president to appear empathetic and in charge of the situation amid predictions by some analysts that the price of a gallon of gas could reach this summer Todays news conference which was almost minutes long was the third in the White House the president had held since his inauguration nearly four months ago Mr Bush also wanted to claim victory for the Congressional passage of a budget plan with a tax cut only slightly smaller than the one he initially proposed And he expressed support for Attorney General John Ashcrofts decision announced shortly before Mr Bush spoke to delay until June the planned execution of Timothy J McVeigh He is lucky to be an American Mr Bush said of Mr McVeigh This is a country that will bend over backwards to make sure that his constitutional rights are guaranteed as opposed to rushing his fate The president added that the failure of FBI officials to turn over documents to which Mr McVeighs defense lawyers were entitled had neither persuaded him that Mr McVeigh was unjustly convicted nor shaken his faith in the fairness with which the death penalty is meted out As the governor of Texas Mr Bush presided over more than executions in six years Asked about the recent expulsion of the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Commission Mr Bush grew more animated than usual his anger evident The decision was an outrageous decision he said To me it undermines the whole credibility of this commission Like Mr Bushs two previous White House news conferences this one was announced only shortly before it began and Mr Bush for a third time eschewed the formal trappings of the East Room for the less formal press briefing room He seemed determined to maintain a jocular demeanor even about grave subjects smiling and laughing for a moment before answering a question about a monthold Palestinian baby killed by Israeli fire this week The issue he discussed most was energy as he set the stage for his administrations announcement of its policy one that will call for the construction of power plants and more oil and gas exploration on federal lands Many voters are concerned about the environmental repercussions of such measures and Mr Bush sought both to address those concerns and to assert that energy problems were long in the making and would be long in the solving This is a situation thats been developing over the years and its going to take a while to correct Mr Bush said presenting himself as the blunt bearer of mixed tidings and later adding Im going to tell the truth when it comes to energy that we have a serious problem that we need to do a couple of things We need to be more conservation minded in America he said But Im also going to say as plainly as I can we wont conserve our way to energy independence We must also increase supply Mr Bushs discussion of the nations energy problems in some ways mirrored his evaluations of the economy in which he has gone out of his way to document that he inherited a troubling situation He said today that he hoped an economic recovery would be imminent but that theres no question that the minute I
