<4228462.1075859662076.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,peter.keohane@enron.com,2000-11-10 07:33:00,Re Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process Cc with Millys comments and concerns in his attached email A few points I would send a clarifying memo and would speak specifically to Diane Seib and Peggy Hedstom to ensure for the time being that all physical and financial power transactions receive legal review This does not mean that LindaSharon have to document all of them rather we can still leave it up to documentation where appropriate But a lawyer needs to review all power confirms for the time being physical and financial to make sure that the product is being properly defined In terms of power product definition Milly has raised valid concerns which warrant legal review which are market opening risk change in market rules between now and market opening and the size of the transactions being entered into There is also the inherent risks of the PPA in essence interrutible risk All these risks need to managed at the front end ie Once a deal is executed by the trader the lawyer cannot fix it after the fact Although the power traders or originators should already understand these risks for the product when they are transacting please meet with Davies and Zufferli ASAP to ensure that they are cognizant of these risks when they are transacting Please check our corporate resolutions to make sure that they cover off execution of confirms for power transactions in a similar fashion to gas transactions ie anything over a year must be signed by Milly if it is less than a year it can be signed by Zufferli as the responsible trader or Davies as the responsible originator I note however for the time being at least until the market opens Milly wants to see all power trades regardless of tenor Peter Forwarded by Peter KeohaneCALECT on PM Rob Milnthorp AM To Greg CT cc Peter CT Subject Re Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process Greg ok with your process for the most part Would like to see all power swaps route through legal until the market is open operating and we have a complete understandingcomfort with the Alberta Market Frankly the size and magnitude of these swaps ie MW MW warrant legal looking at and me for that matter I think we dropped the ball when we sent out power swap confirms with little thought given to market opening risk change in rules rate caps etc These issues should have been thought through between commercial and legal before any swaps were executed In some respects we have now doubled down on our PPA exposure by entering into unconditional swaps Regards Milnthorp Greg Johnston AM To Mary CT Sharon CT Chris CT Mark E CT Peggy CT Tana CT Peter CT Jonathan CT Rob CT Mark CT Dianne CT Linda CT Mark CT John CT cc Subject Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process Further to a discussion with Mark Taylor I wanted to confirm our collective understandingproposal regarding the legal procedures associated with the financial trading process in Canada As you are all aware all financial confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm desk in Calgary However it seems that there has been some confusion relating to the legal procedures associated with this process In short I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for Canadian physical confirms That is as is currently the process for physical deals the commercial people will generate all deal tickets and to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward the Calgary confirm desk will generate have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation letters based upon those deal tickets with no involvement of the legal department However for any financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms as well as amendments just as with physical transactions the confirm desk will provide the deal ticket to Linda or Sharon in Calgary Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the deal tickets which will be reviewed and approved by either myself or Mark Powell Once approved the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing lawyer checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review approve and have executed by McKay Milnthorp or Zufferli as appropriate The executed confirm will then be returned to either Linda or Sharon who will attend to distributing it to the counterparty Again this will only be required for transactions which are out of the ordinary With respect to negotiating and implementing and addressing ongoing legal concerns with respect to ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada Mark Taylors group and I understand specifically Mary Cook will continue to have responsibility for such matters Therefore to the extent that we need to put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal concerns about the implementation of the ISDA the process will be the same as it has been in the past meaning that those matters will be dealt with in Houston Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations I think it is essential that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run each of Sharon and Linda as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggys group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters through her ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our legal group to deal with these matters As well we will need to ensure that Linda and Sharon receive either from Houston or Dianne electronic versions of all confirmation precedents ie confirm forms amendment forms etc necessary for them to properly undertake these activities If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above please do not hesitate to contact me Otherwise I think we should implement these procedures as soon as possible including having Tana join us for a few crisp winter days in Calgary Thanks Greg

it a as result of the politaical risk associated with the government changing the market rules or legislation As time has passed since the first auction the Government has showm a much greater inclination to do some not well thought out initiatives geared toward keeping prices down From Mark E Haedicke on AM CST To Peter CT cc Subject Re Plan B Auction Need for Approvals Peter I think your collective emails constitute the legal risk memo What do you think the legal risk rating ought to be Regards Mark Peter Keohane AM To Mark E CT cc John J nron Greg CT Derek CT Rob CT Subject Plan B Auction Need for Approvals Mark thanks for the voice mail In terms of a risk memo I agree that one should not be necessary as in many respects this can be characterized as normal course trading within position limits under a standardized Master Agreement and without an outlay of capital but hopefully the following together with my memo from last night copy attached suffices to the extent a risk memo is required In terms of unusual risks We do not have any rights to collateral under the proposed Master However the counterparty is the Balancing Pool which is essentially Government of Alberta credit risk Derek Davies is I believe dealing with Credit to resolve credit issues In fact I believe the Balancing Pool is taking significant risk as it is selling the power firm under a Master which does not match up to the interruptible nature of the PPAs it holds The Balancing Pool will be secured under the Master by a parental guarantee of Enron Corp and has a somewhat discretionary right to call for collateral from us under the Master if there is a material change in Enron Corps creditworthiness It is a requirement of the auction that we will have entered into backtoback physical hedges for of the volume we acquire and we are currently working at putting those deals in place conditional on us bidding and being successful in the auction Penalties can be imposed if of the volume purchased is not properly hedged As we are dealing with the Government of Alberta we always run the risk as we are somewhat seeing now with respect to the Sundance PPA we acquired in the first auction that they can change the auction rules the market rules or the legislation in ways that are adverse to us In terms of the auction rules as with the first auction they could be better drafted but our fundamental concern will be to make sure that it is clear that if we post a bid deposit and do not bid that we get the deposit back and to ensure that the rules are clear enough that we are comfortable that we are in complete control of whether or not we can comply with the rules Peter Milly sorry for not copying you on my first memo see below Forwarded by Peter KeohaneCALECT on AM Enron Capital Trade Resources Canada Corp From Peter Keohane PM To Mark E CT cc John J nron Derek CT Greg CT Subject Plan B Auction Need for Approvals Mark as I have mentioned to you the Plan B Alberta Power Auction is scheduled for Nov under which Enron Canada can purchase for oneyear terms in each of three successive years up to approximately MWyear MWyear and MWyear of the unsold PPA capacity that reverted back to the Balancing Pool of Alberta following the first auction last August The bid qualification documentation needs to be in Friday and US Thanksgiving is ThursdayFriday I wanted you to be aware of this and determine from you if any corporate approvals need to be obtained Firstly Derek DaviesJohn Zufferli will only be bidding to the extent authorized by Lavo Secondly bid qualification commits us to the rules of the auction the forms of documentation to govern both the auction and the purchase if we are successful and requires a bid deposit approximately CMM but does not obligate us to bid and provided we comply with the auction rules the Bid Deposit will be returned after the auction Thirdly unlike the PPA auction the risks are much less significant in terms of volume and term In terms of documentation if we are the successful bidder we will be buying power from the Balancing Pool under a physical Master which seems to be a Canadianized version of the EEI Master and which although not entirely to our liking is generally satisfactory Fourthly the position will I understand be managed in the power trading book within approved position limits Note The nominal amounts owing ie no up front payment is required on an unhedged basis for the entire MWs in year would be something like CMM assuming a CMW purchase price Year would be CMM and year would be CMM Given the nature of the transaction the short time that we have with US Thanksgiving intervening and numerous other demands I do not believe that a DASH Risk Memo andor Board Approval is necessary

A few points I would send a clarifying memo and would speak specifically to Diane Seib and Peggy Hedstom to ensure for the time being that all physical and financial power transactions receive legal review This does not mean that LindaSharon have to document all of them rather we can still leave it up to documentation where appropriate But a lawyer needs to review all power confirms for the time being physical and financial to make sure that the product is being properly defined In terms of power product definition Milly has raised valid concerns which warrant legal review which are market opening risk change in market rules between now and market opening and the size of the transactions being entered into There is also the inherent risks of the PPA in essence interrutible risk All these risks need to managed at the front end ie Once a deal is executed by the trader the lawyer cannot fix it after the fact Although the power traders or originators should already understand these risks for the product when they are transacting please meet with Davies and Zufferli ASAP to ensure that they are cognizant of these risks when they are transacting Please check our corporate resolutions to make sure that they cover off execution of confirms for power transactions in a similar fashion to gas transactions ie anything over a year must be signed by Milly if it is less than a year it can be signed by Zufferli as the responsible trader or Davies as the responsible originator I note however for the time being at least until the market opens Milly wants to see all power trades regardless of tenor Peter Forwarded by Peter KeohaneCALECT on PM Rob Milnthorp AM To Greg CT cc Peter CT Subject Re Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process Greg ok with your process for the most part Would like to see all power swaps route through legal until the market is open operating and we have a complete understandingcomfort with the Alberta Market Frankly the size and magnitude of these swaps ie MW MW warrant legal looking at and me for that matter I think we dropped the ball when we sent out power swap confirms with little thought given to market opening risk change in rules rate caps etc These issues should have been thought through between commercial and legal before any swaps were executed In some respects we have now doubled down on our PPA exposure by entering into unconditional swaps Regards Milnthorp Greg Johnston AM To Mary CT Sharon CT Chris CT Mark E CT Peggy CT Tana CT Peter CT Jonathan CT Rob CT Mark CT Dianne CT Linda CT Mark CT John CT cc Subject Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process Further to a discussion with Mark Taylor I wanted to confirm our collective understandingproposal regarding the legal procedures associated with the financial trading process in Canada As you are all aware all financial confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm desk in Calgary However it seems that there has been some confusion relating to the legal procedures associated with this process In short I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for Canadian physical confirms That is as is currently the process for physical deals the commercial people will generate all deal tickets and to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward the Calgary confirm desk will generate have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation letters based upon those deal tickets with no involvement of the legal department However for any financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms as well as amendments just as with physical transactions the confirm desk will provide the deal ticket to Linda or Sharon in Calgary Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the deal tickets which will be reviewed and approved by either myself or Mark Powell Once approved the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing lawyer checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review approve and have executed by McKay Milnthorp or Zufferli as appropriate The executed confirm will then be returned to either Linda or Sharon who will attend to distributing it to the counterparty Again this will only be required for transactions which are out of the ordinary With respect to negotiating and implementing and addressing ongoing legal concerns with respect to ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada Mark Taylors group and I understand specifically Mary Cook will continue to have responsibility for such matters Therefore to the extent that we need to put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal concerns about the implementation of the ISDA the process will be the same as it has been in the past meaning that those matters will be dealt with in Houston Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations I think it is essential that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run each of Sharon and Linda as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggys group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters through her ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our legal group to deal with these matters As well we will need to ensure that Linda and Sharon receive either from Houston or Dianne electronic versions of all confirmation precedents ie confirm forms amendment forms etc necessary for them to properly undertake these activities If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above please do not hesitate to contact me Otherwise I think we should implement these procedures as soon as possible including having Tana join us for a few crisp winter days in Calgary Thanks Greg

it a as result of the politaical risk associated with the government changing the market rules or legislation As time has passed since the first auction the Government has showm a much greater inclination to do some not well thought out initiatives geared toward keeping prices down From Mark E Haedicke on AM CST To Peter CT cc Subject Re Plan B Auction Need for Approvals Peter I think your collective emails constitute the legal risk memo What do you think the legal risk rating ought to be Regards Mark Peter Keohane AM To Mark E CT cc John J nron Greg CT Derek CT Rob CT Subject Plan B Auction Need for Approvals Mark thanks for the voice mail In terms of a risk memo I agree that one should not be necessary as in many respects this can be characterized as normal course trading within position limits under a standardized Master Agreement and without an outlay of capital but hopefully the following together with my memo from last night copy attached suffices to the extent a risk memo is required In terms of unusual risks We do not have any rights to collateral under the proposed Master However the counterparty is the Balancing Pool which is essentially Government of Alberta credit risk Derek Davies is I believe dealing with Credit to resolve credit issues In fact I believe the Balancing Pool is taking significant risk as it is selling the power firm under a Master which does not match up to the interruptible nature of the PPAs it holds The Balancing Pool will be secured under the Master by a parental guarantee of Enron Corp and has a somewhat discretionary right to call for collateral from us under the Master if there is a material change in Enron Corps creditworthiness It is a requirement of the auction that we will have entered into backtoback physical hedges for of the volume we acquire and we are currently working at putting those deals in place conditional on us bidding and being successful in the auction Penalties can be imposed if of the volume purchased is not properly hedged As we are dealing with the Government of Alberta we always run the risk as we are somewhat seeing now with respect to the Sundance PPA we acquired in the first auction that they can change the auction rules the market rules or the legislation in ways that are adverse to us In terms of the auction rules as with the first auction they could be better drafted but our fundamental concern will be to make sure that it is clear that if we post a bid deposit and do not bid that we get the deposit back and to ensure that the rules are clear enough that we are comfortable that we are in complete control of whether or not we can comply with the rules Peter Milly sorry for not copying you on my first memo see below Forwarded by Peter KeohaneCALECT on AM Enron Capital Trade Resources Canada Corp From Peter Keohane PM To Mark E CT cc John J nron Derek CT Greg CT Subject Plan B Auction Need for Approvals Mark as I have mentioned to you the Plan B Alberta Power Auction is scheduled for Nov under which Enron Canada can purchase for oneyear terms in each of three successive years up to approximately MWyear MWyear and MWyear of the unsold PPA capacity that reverted back to the Balancing Pool of Alberta following the first auction last August The bid qualification documentation needs to be in Friday and US Thanksgiving is ThursdayFriday I wanted you to be aware of this and determine from you if any corporate approvals need to be obtained Firstly Derek DaviesJohn Zufferli will only be bidding to the extent authorized by Lavo Secondly bid qualification commits us to the rules of the auction the forms of documentation to govern both the auction and the purchase if we are successful and requires a bid deposit approximately CMM but does not obligate us to bid and provided we comply with the auction rules the Bid Deposit will be returned after the auction Thirdly unlike the PPA auction the risks are much less significant in terms of volume and term In terms of documentation if we are the successful bidder we will be buying power from the Balancing Pool under a physical Master which seems to be a Canadianized version of the EEI Master and which although not entirely to our liking is generally satisfactory Fourthly the position will I understand be managed in the power trading book within approved position limits Note The nominal amounts owing ie no up front payment is required on an unhedged basis for the entire MWs in year would be something like CMM assuming a CMW purchase price Year would be CMM and year would be CMM Given the nature of the transaction the short time that we have with US Thanksgiving intervening and numerous other demands I do not believe that a DASH Risk Memo andor Board Approval is necessary but please let me know I will leave you a brief voice mail to followup Peter

outstanding matters respecting the Canadian business which may not be exhaustive Further at the outset and to manage expectations I want to emphasize that the preparation of the Canadian business for commercial startup needs to be considered within the framework of human resource constraints attending to finalization of acquisition agreements and arrangements with Enron Canada for the acquisition of the Canadian business interest and as yet unclear understanding with respect to various matters of detail that are required with respect to the commencement of the Canadian business within UBSW At the same time I understand that there is an extraordinary amount of work that needs to be done to address the US side of the North American power business and that the detail required to be considered with respect to the Canadian gas and power business may have to take a back seat to those matters for the time being With that the following is my list of issues that need to be considered Trading Forms a Gas GTC I have circulated my blackline comments to the form prepared in Houston noting certain of my comments are jurisdictional to Canada but others are generic to the form in general The blackline is attached b Financial GTC Again I have circulated my blackline comments to the form prepared in Houston noting certain of my comments are jurisdictional to Canada and others are more generic to the form in general The blackline is attached c Power GTC I have not yet had the opportunity to review or consider the proposed forms prepared in Houston and d Master Agreements gas power and financial I have not yet had the opportunity to review or consider the proposed forms prepared in Houston Subject to the other matters referred to below the priority for first trading in our market is finalizing the Gas GTC and the Financial GTC Guarantees I attach a blacklined revision to the UBS AG form as revised by Carol with my revisions reflecting comments to the form as commented on by Carol Structurally I have the following concerns a I believe we should consider a more flexible description of all potential gas power and financial transactions in the recitals to the guarantee to facilitate a broadbased guarantee from the counterparty b I do not believe that the guarantee should be limited to an aggregate financial limit This requires credit monitoring and in my experience can result in the risk of underguaranteed amounts with the counterparty Further where UBS AG has a direct covenant it seems to me that there would be no corresponding limit on its exposure c I have other comments some of which again are jurisdictional to Canada and others of which are more generic to the form in general d as I have mentioned we need to have an approved form of guarantee to be provided from UBS AG in support of UBS Warburg Energy Canada Ltd UBSWC which I assume will be in the same form merely reversed to be in favour of the trading counterparty We will also need to understand the specific internal process we must follow to obtain the UBS AG guarantee of UBS Warburg Energy Canada Ltd e where UBS AG is providing guarantee support for UBSWC we expect that some market participants or institutions will require guarantee support in forms which are different from UBS AGs customary guarantee form In other words various market participants such as transportation providers NOVA TCPL Westcoast Foothills ANG etc transmission administrators EAL IMO gas inventory administrators NOVA gas storage providers exchange operators Natural Gas Exchange Intercontinental Exchange WattExchange power pool administrators PPoA IMO etc some of which are regulated and others of which only deal on their own terms may require guarantee support in their own forms Again in these instances we will have to understand the specific internal process through which we can obtain the customized guarantee from UBS AG and f we need to resolve the mechanism for providing a UBS AG guarantee for online trades entered into prior to negotiating a fully guaranteed Master Agreement Transaction Procedures With respect to UBSWC we need to understand the following a for trading counterparties we need a detailed understanding of the proposed execution guarantee and daily novation procedures back to the London branch b who will be the authorized signing officers and what will be the execution procedures for UBSWC for GTCs Masters Confirms etc c for nontradingmarket participation counterparties ie transportation providers transmission administrators gas inventory providers gas storage providers exchange operators power pool administrators etc are the same transaction procedures intended ie is UBSWC the executing counterparty guaranteed by UBS AG and do the novation procedures back to the London branch apply d are the trading confirms being updated and e is consideration being given to procedures whereby trading confirms can be eliminated ie the volume of confirms for Enron Online had become somewhat overwhelming for the Operations Group and they have indicated to me that there are proposals to remove the need for trading confirms at least for online transactions RegulatoryMarket Participation a I understand that Rob Hemstock has provided detailed documentation with respect to the permittingmarket participation requirements and has partially drafted the required forms Finalizing most of these applications requires some of the more detailed understandings I have referred to above b I have not been involved in the creation of UBSWC which I understand has been done by Stikeman Elliott but we need to ensure that it is corporately registered to carry on business as an extraprovincial corporation in all key jurisdictions Alberta Ontario and British Columbia and c We will require for various purposes including obtaining regulatory and permitting approvals and authorizations copies of the incorporation and organization documentation for UBSWC including list of directors and officers d In some instances eg NEB gas and power export permits the Canadian permit will be held by UBS Warburg Energy Ltd and therefore we need copies of the incorporation and organization documentation for UBS Warburg Energy Ltd We will also need to ensure UBS Warburg Energy Ltd it is corporately registered to carry on business in Canada and that we are provided with Canadian organization documentation for UBS Warburg Energy Ltd that we can use to satisfy the NEB of its corporate status

Brunswick Power In summary ECC pays the bank West LB directly in three installments under an offbalance sheet lease financing arrangement The first installment of US MM was made Dec The next installment is due Feb of US MM and the third installment is due roughly March of US MM The drag on the financing is that West LB through whom ENA structures its offbalance sheet turbine financings is not a Canadian resident for tax purposes and therefore is not tax efficient to ECC in that there is a withholding tax payment on the interest not principal component of each leasefinancing payment An offbalance sheet financing with a Canadian resident financial institution would eliminate this tax inefficiency and this is what I was referring to when I indicated some work may still be required to restructure the turbine financing The withholding tax if we keep this structure will total roughly C over all of the leasefinancing payments Chris Calger has the exact figure Any decision to change the structure should have regard to these costs and the transaction costs and fees associated with finding a new Canadian resident offbalance sheet lender In addition if we decide to keep the turbines or sell or transfer the turbines to ENA or a third party depending on commercially what it is we decide to do with them additional work may be required to take title to the turbines or to assignrestructure the West LB financing and the New Brunswick Power purchase agreement I am confident that the bulk of commercial legal work for any of these transactions can be handled internally but that the tax legal work may require the input of outside counsel We are also obligated to pay GST but this is ultimately reimbursed through the lease financing althoguh there is a time value of money component that is not recovered from the time GST is paid and when the GST rebate is made Forwarded by Peter KeohaneCALECT on AM Greg Johnston PM To Peter CT cc Eric CT Subject WestLB Transaction Peter referring to your request for an update as to the status and mechanics of the West LB transaction relating to our acquisition of the NB Power turbines please be advised as follows Although ENA executed the Acquisition and Development Agreement the Agreement with WestLB all of ENAs interest in that Agreement was immediately assigned to Enron Canada meaning that we are directly responsible for making all funding requests and all cost of borrowing payments to WestLB The initial payment on the turbines was made through WestLB for an amount of US on December GST was payable on US of that amount The next installment is due to NB Power on February and is for an amount of US Laura Scott will be initiating the funding request in the next day or so to allow the advance to be a LIBOR advance WestLB will then attend to paying the installment payment plus GST to NB Power on Feb The final installment payment is for an amount of US and is due on the earlier of the date on which we commence disassembling the turbines and March The cost to Enron Canada for utilizing WestLB who is not registered in Canada to carry on business is that we are required to pay withholding tax of on all costs of borrowing ie interest payments The interest is calculated at a LIBOR rate WestLB has now registered themselves in Canada for GST purposes and will be making the required GST payments to NB Power and then applying for the GST rebate which rebate amount is for our account under the Agreement WestLB is aware that depending on how we proceed with our required use of the turbines they will be taken out either with respect to i the interim financing or if the interim financing period is short ie if we were going to proceed immediately to finish paying for the turbines and commence moving them ii when we put the SPV in place to build the project If we determine that the turbines are to go to Houston and be moved into the US the withholding tax issue obviously disappears If we determine to proceed with the project in some fashion but the interim financing period will be more than a month or so it probably makes sense to remove WestLB from the interim financing thereby saving ourselves the cost of the withholding tax One potential fix is to bring in a Canadian bank to act as funding agent with WestLB continuing to bear the transactional risk which could reduce the cost to us of getting a new bank comfortable with the financing arrangement We have not yet canvassed all the possible solutions so I have not thought through to the full extent whether this proposal is viable I think that you are aware of the reasons that the determination was made to proceed with WestLB despite the withholding tax issue but if you would like to discuss this any further or if there is anything else you would like to discuss I am happy to do so Greg

Brunswick Power In summary ECC pays the bank West LB directly in three installments under an offbalance sheet lease financing arrangement The first installment of US MM was made Dec The next installment is due Feb of US MM and the third installment is due roughly March of US MM The drag on the financing is that West LB through whom ENA structures its offbalance sheet turbine financings is not a Canadian resident for tax purposes and therefore is not tax efficient to ECC in that there is a withholding tax payment on the interest not principal component of each leasefinancing payment An offbalance sheet financing with a Canadian resident financial institution would eliminate this tax inefficiency and this is what I was referring to when I indicated some work may still be required to restructure the turbine financing The withholding tax if we keep this structure will total roughly C over all of the leasefinancing payments Chris Calger has the exact figure Any decision to change the structure should have regard to these costs and the transaction costs and fees associated with finding a new Canadian resident offbalance sheet lender In addition if we decide to keep the turbines or sell or transfer the turbines to ENA or a third party depending on commercially what it is we decide to do with them additional work may be required to take title to the turbines or to assignrestructure the West LB financing and the New Brunswick Power purchase agreement I am confident that the bulk of commercial legal work for any of these transactions can be handled internally but that the tax legal work may require the input of outside counsel We are also obligated to pay GST but this is ultimately reimbursed through the lease financing althoguh there is a time value of money component that is not recovered from the time GST is paid and when the GST rebate is made Forwarded by Peter KeohaneCALECT on AM Greg Johnston PM To Peter CT cc Eric CT Subject WestLB Transaction Peter referring to your request for an update as to the status and mechanics of the West LB transaction relating to our acquisition of the NB Power turbines please be advised as follows Although ENA executed the Acquisition and Development Agreement the Agreement with WestLB all of ENAs interest in that Agreement was immediately assigned to Enron Canada meaning that we are directly responsible for making all funding requests and all cost of borrowing payments to WestLB The initial payment on the turbines was made through WestLB for an amount of US on December GST was payable on US of that amount The next installment is due to NB Power on February and is for an amount of US Laura Scott will be initiating the funding request in the next day or so to allow the advance to be a LIBOR advance WestLB will then attend to paying the installment payment plus GST to NB Power on Feb The final installment payment is for an amount of US and is due on the earlier of the date on which we commence disassembling the turbines and March The cost to Enron Canada for utilizing WestLB who is not registered in Canada to carry on business is that we are required to pay withholding tax of on all costs of borrowing ie interest payments The interest is calculated at a LIBOR rate WestLB has now registered themselves in Canada for GST purposes and will be making the required GST payments to NB Power and then applying for the GST rebate which rebate amount is for our account under the Agreement WestLB is aware that depending on how we proceed with our required use of the turbines they will be taken out either with respect to i the interim financing or if the interim financing period is short ie if we were going to proceed immediately to finish paying for the turbines and commence moving them ii when we put the SPV in place to build the project If we determine that the turbines are to go to Houston and be moved into the US the withholding tax issue obviously disappears If we

Canada Corp Comments on the PGE Form of Master Forwarded by Mark PowellCALECT on PM Embedded image moved to file From Mark Powell picpcx PM To gecom cc Peter CT Subject Enron Canada Corp Comments on the PGE Form of Master Pursuant to your meeting at our office yesterday Peter Keohane asked me to provide you with a brief list of key issuesamendments relating to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company form of Master Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement the Master In this regard we have tried to restrict our comments to those of our concerns which are most important to us Please be aware that these comments are subject to Enron Canada Corp Enron Canada being satisfied with all other matters which were discussed during the meeting ie setoff issues credit issues issues relating to the Confirmation and Amendment to Gas Supply Agreement the security and intercreditor agreement and the side letter agreement currently being negotiated with Travis McCullough of Enron North America Corp etc Our concerns in the order of the Master are as follows Verbal Agreements We need to ensure that the agreement contemplates the fact that agreements whether they be for Baseload Gas Multimonth Gas or Swing Gas will be binding upon the parties agreeing to the terms of the transaction ie determination of the buyerseller the DCQ the period of delivery the delivery point etc regardless of whether the transaction has been reduced to writing This should be a relatively easy fix to a s of the Transaction Procedures b modifying a number of definitions in Article so that they do not refer to as agreed upon in Exhibit A or as set forth in Exhibit A but refer to as agreed upon by the Parties c modifying the definitions of Baseload Gas Multimonth Gas and Swing Gas d modifying sections such s s s etc accordingly Confirmation by Seller In connection with the issue above the confirmation procedure should be amended such that Enron Canada as opposed to Buyer in s and and as opposed to PGE Core in s may confirm the transactions This change is in line with issue number above and allows for the potential for Enron Online transactions Please note the Exhibit A will need to be slightly modified to account for this change Canadian Delivery Points Enron Canada requires s to be amended such that transactions with at the border delivery points will be deemed to occur on the Canadian side of the border The section should state The Delivery Point for any Gas sold and purchased at Easport Idaho or Sumas Washington by Seller or Sellers Transporter to Buyer or Buyers Transporter shall be on the Canadian side of the international border at the interconnection of Kingsgate British Columbia and Huntington British Columbia respectively where Buyer will take title of the Gas unless otherwise agreed Invoicing Enron Canada requires that the clause subject to receiving a confirming statement from Buyers Transporter for the quantity of gas actually delivered be deleted from the second sentence of s Further the second to last sentence of s should be replaced with the following If actual quantities are not available by the billing date billing and payment will be prepared based upon the scheduled contract quantities In this regard s should also be deleted Enron Canada Credit Support In s any guarantee provided by Enron Corp must be construed and enforced under the laws of Texas Secondly Enron Canada requires the following clause to be inserted at the end of the first sentence of s provided that Enron Canada shall only be required to provide assurances of payment in the event that PGE Cores net exposure to Enron Canada under all Transactions under this Agreement exceeds US to be determined upon completion of credit analysis Force Majeure Enron Canada requires the removal of s s and s relating to Force Majeure These sections are to be replaced with the following Suspension for Force Majeure This Article entitled NonPerformance is the sole and exclusive excuse for nonperformance permitted under this Agreement and all other excuses at law or in equity are waived Except with regard to payment obligations in the event either Party is rendered unable wholly or in part by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations under this Agreement it is agreed that upon such Partys giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the other Party as soon as reasonably possible such notice to be confirmed in writing then the obligations of the Party giving such notice to the extent that they are affected by such Force Majeure shall be suspended from its inception during the continuance of the Force Majeure for a period of sixty Days in the aggregate during any twelveMonth period but for no longer period After the sixtieth Day the Parties shall be obligated to perform Force Majeure for Transactions with a Delivery Point at NOVA Inventory Transfer NIT If the Delivery Point is NIT this Article shall apply Force Majeure means only an interruption curtailment or prorationing by NOVA of NIT service which affects all NOVA shippers who had nominated for deliveries or receipts to take place by NIT on that Gas day On any Gas day or any portion of a Gas day that there is a Force Majeure and either Party provides notice of the Force Majeure to the other Seller shall deliver to Buyer and Buyer shall receive from Seller that percentage of the DCQ which is equal to the percentage amount of Gas which according to NOVA had been nominated by all NOVA shippers for NIT and which NOVA is not interrupting curtailing or prorationing on that Gas day or that portion of a Gas day Force Majeure for Transactions with a Delivery Point other than NIT If the Delivery Point is other than NIT this Article shall apply Force Majeure means only interruptions or curtailments of firm service at the Delivery Points by Sellers Transporter or Buyers Transporter regardless of whether Buyers Transporter or Sellers Transporter is declaring any event of force majeure On any Gas day that Force Majeure applies both Parties obligations to deliver and receive Gas shall be reduced by the same percentage that Buyers Transporter or Sellers Transporter interrupts or curtails firm service at the Delivery Points on such Gas day Please note the reference to Article in s should be amended to a reference to Article once the changes indicated above are made Liquidated Damages Calculation The calculation of liquidated damages in s uses the highest daily price and lowest daily price in the index below However I could locate no reference to an index below to make the calculation As are result we need to specify an index We should probably insert a provision to deal with circumstances in which the index ceases to be reported or there is a material change in the formula for or method of calculation is changed as per the recent CPGR AECO C Daily Index changes Eligible Financial Contract Representation As a supplement to the provisions of s Enron Canada requires the following provisions to be added to the Master Eligible Financial Contract This Agreement all Transactions under this Agreement and any guarantee thereof as applicable each and together constitute an eligible financial contract under and in all proceedings related to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act Canada the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act Canada or the Windingup and

withheld or given entirely at the option of such Party provided however either Party may transfer or assign its interest hereunder to an affiliate subsidiary or to any person or entity succeeding to all or substantially all of the assets of such Party all without the prior written approval of the other Party but no such assignment will relieve the assigning Party of its obligations hereunder Further a new s should be inserted stating Enurement This Agreement shall enure to and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties hereto Canadian Law Issues Enron Canada

think you will se that absent a perfect world Robert is sugge sting only minor changes to the setoff clause previuosly circulated by Mar k for EWS trading contracts Roberts has also attached more fully develope d provisions for both triangular setoff and for square setoff which woul d be applicable under the Master Netting and Collateral Contract which add ress the issues of mutuality privity and consideration in greater detail Original Message From ROBERT ANDERSON ENRON mailtoIMCEA NOTESROBERTANDERSONCrobertEandersonblakesEcomEEN NRONcom SentWednesday August PM ToKeohane Peter SubjectSetOff Language Further to our conversations yesterday and today I attach the following Memorandum of Square SetOff Combinations Memorandum of Triangular SetOff Combinations Mandatory SetOff Language for EWS Trading Contracts Revision bl acklined to the version forwarded by Mark Haedicke Clean copy of attachment Revised Triangular Set Off Provisions and Square SetOff Provision This is a very interesting although somewhat complex assignment At your r equest I have reviewed the draft Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts as well as the setoff language in the draft Master Netting SetO ff and Security Agreement with a view to developing terms of setoff that w ill be enforceable in Canada For the moment I have considered the laws applicable in Alberta and have received input from my Ontario partner Kevi n McElcheran Unlike certain jurisdictions including for example Great Britain in Ca nada a creditors setoff rights are generally preserved in an insolvency Section of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act RSC c B a s amended and section of the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act SC c C as amended both expressly reserve application of the law of setoff in the context of an insolvency to which those acts apply Contra ctual setoff provisions are ordinarily enforceable in an insolvency provid ed the contract of which the setoff provision is part is itself enforceabl e ie has all of the elements of an enforceable contract including privit y and consideration Setoff is a powerful tool in insolvency because it permits a creditor with an otherwise unsecured claim to effectively satisfy that claim on a dollar fordollar basis out of amounts the creditor in turn owes to the insolvent company This is done at the expense of other unsecured creditors who wou ld otherwise receive the benefit of the debt owed by the settingoff credit or to the insolvent company The essence of setoff is mutuality the settingoff of a claim and crossc laim between the same parties The difficulty with the expansive setoff t erms sought by Enron is that they would permit setoff as between Enron a nd its counterparty of debts owed by or to a third party My concern is th at such purported setoff is so different in substance from the common no tion of setoff which requires mutuality as to be setoff in name only W ithout mutuality I am concerned that a court may not recognize such seto ff of obligations relating to third parties as setoff within the meanin g of Canadian insolvency legislation The concern is not only that a court may be reticent to allow receivables owed by third parties to the insolven t state to be used to satisfy the insolvent estates indebtedness to a cred itor The court may be view any contractual arrangement that baldly purpor ts to do that as something other than setoff known under the laws of Canad a I am not however aware of any case law on point With a view to solving the perceived problem with lack of mutuality I have incorporated language referred to in the materials as an aggregate liabi lity clause to try and ensure that in each instance the claim and crossc laim will be between the same parties The first two attachments analyse the various combinations involved in squa re and triangular setoff These memoranda serve as a check list to ensure that the proposed language will cover every possible combination of claim and crossclaim Turning now to the Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts att achment I have the following comments I have included wording to clarify that the option to setoff is to b e exercised jointly by X and its affiliates The reason for this is to avo id the uncertainty associated with multiple parties having the ability to e xercise inconsistent setoff options We must assume that this setoff pro vision will be included in separate contracts between a counterparty and va rious Enron affiliates If the counterparty defaults on more than one of t hese contracts or if they contain crossdefault provisions the Enron af filiate that is a party to each separate contract would be X under that c ontract and would have the option to exercise the setoff rights thereunder including the right to setoff against amounts it owes amounts that are o wed to any of its affiliates Those affiliates may each in turn be X und er their respective contracts and similarly entitled to exercise setoff ri ghts While it is unlikely that Enron and its affiliates would act inconsi stently in exercising setoff rights making it clear that the option to se toff must be exercised jointly by X and its affiliates minimizes any atta ck of the setoff provision on the basis of uncertainty associated with the potential for inconsistent exercise of the option to setoff With respect to the requirement that the setoff contract must have con sideration I have included an acknowledgement by the parties including af filiates that each has received valuable consideration for the covenants i nvolved This provision is not a complete answer to the requirement of con sideration but is helpful Paragraph B is included to address the mutuality requirement by inclu ding an aggregate liability clause as discussed above In the second paragraph of Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Co ntracts the changes to the sentence including limitation to have been ma de to clarify that the setoff provision is without limitation to any other rights which X or its affiliates may have I was concerned that the with out prejudice language in the prior draft would leave it open to the defa ulting party to argue that the setoff provision cannot work to its prejudi ce The balance of the revisions are simply drafting changes made in an att empt to improve the clarity and certainty of the terms involved In attach ment I have attempted to minimize the changes with the result that it is not as clear and certain as it might be I have also attached a revised tr iangular setoff provision attachment which is clearer more certain an d about one page longer Finally I have included a square setoff provision attachment which af fords Enron and any nondefaulting counterparty even better setoff prote ction As discussed I will include this provision in the Master Netting Setoff and Security Agreement form I would be pleased to discuss the attachments with you at your convenience Best

the PGE Form of Master Pursuant to your meeting at our office yesterday Peter Keohane asked me to provide you with a brief list of key issuesamendments relating to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company form of Master Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement the Master In this regard we have tried to restrict our comments to those of our concerns which are most important to us Please be aware that these comments are subject to Enron Canada Corp Enron Canada being satisfied with all other matters which were discussed during the meeting ie setoff issues credit issues issues relating to the Confirmation and Amendment to Gas Supply Agreement the security and intercreditor agreement and the side letter agreement currently being negotiated with Travis McCullough of Enron North America Corp etc Our concerns in the order of the Master are as follows Verbal Agreements We need to ensure that the agreement contemplates the fact that agreements whether they be for Baseload Gas Multimonth Gas or Swing Gas will be binding upon the parties agreeing to the terms of the transaction ie determination of the buyerseller the DCQ the period of delivery the delivery point etc regardless of whether the transaction has been reduced to writing This should be a relatively easy fix to a s of the Transaction Procedures b modifying a number of definitions in Article so that they do not refer to as agreed upon in Exhibit A or as set forth in Exhibit A but refer to as agreed upon by the Parties c modifying the definitions of Baseload Gas Multimonth Gas and Swing Gas d modifying sections such s s s etc accordingly Confirmation by Seller In connection with the issue above the confirmation procedure should be amended such that Enron Canada as opposed to Buyer in s and and as opposed to PGE Core in s may confirm the transactions This change is in line with issue number above and allows for the potential for Enron Online transactions Please note the Exhibit A will need to be slightly modified to account for this change Canadian Delivery Points Enron Canada requires s to be amended such that transactions with at the border delivery points will be deemed to occur on the Canadian side of the border The section should state The Delivery Point for any Gas sold and purchased at Easport Idaho or Sumas Washington by Seller or Sellers Transporter to Buyer or Buyers Transporter shall be on the Canadian side of the international border at the interconnection of Kingsgate British Columbia and Huntington British Columbia respectively where Buyer will take title of the Gas unless otherwise agreed Invoicing Enron Canada requires that the clause subject to receiving a confirming statement from Buyers Transporter for the quantity of gas actually delivered be deleted from the second sentence of s Further the second to last sentence of s should be replaced with the following If actual quantities are not available by the billing date billing and payment will be prepared based upon the scheduled contract quantities In this regard s should also be deleted Enron Canada Credit Support In s any guarantee provided by Enron Corp must be construed and enforced under the laws of Texas Secondly Enron Canada requires the following clause to be inserted at the end of the first sentence of s provided that Enron Canada shall only be required to provide assurances of payment in the event that PGE Cores net exposure to Enron Canada under all Transactions under this Agreement exceeds US to be determined upon completion of credit analysis Force Majeure Enron Canada requires the removal of s s and s relating to Force Majeure These sections are to be replaced with the following Suspension for Force Majeure This Article entitled NonPerformance is the sole and exclusive excuse for nonperformance permitted under this Agreement and all other excuses at law or in equity are waived Except with regard to payment obligations in the event either Party is rendered unable wholly or in part by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations under this Agreement it is agreed that upon such Partys giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the other Party as soon as reasonably possible such notice to be confirmed in writing then the obligations of the Party giving such notice to the extent that they are affected by such Force Majeure shall be suspended from its inception during the continuance of the Force Majeure for a period of sixty Days in the aggregate during any twelveMonth period but for no longer period After the sixtieth Day the Parties shall be obligated to perform Force Majeure for Transactions with a Delivery Point at NOVA Inventory Transfer NIT If the Delivery Point is NIT this Article shall apply Force Majeure means only an interruption curtailment or prorationing by NOVA of NIT service which affects all NOVA shippers who had nominated for deliveries or receipts to take place by NIT on that Gas day On any Gas day or any portion of a Gas day that there is a Force Majeure and either Party provides notice of the Force Majeure to the other Seller shall deliver to Buyer and Buyer shall receive from Seller that percentage of the DCQ which is equal to the percentage amount of Gas which according to NOVA had been nominated by all NOVA shippers for NIT and which NOVA is not interrupting curtailing or prorationing on that Gas day or that portion of a Gas day Force Majeure for Transactions with a Delivery Point other than NIT If the Delivery Point is other than NIT this Article shall apply Force Majeure means only interruptions or curtailments of firm service at the Delivery Points by Sellers Transporter or Buyers Transporter regardless of whether Buyers Transporter or Sellers Transporter is declaring any event of force majeure On any Gas day that Force Majeure applies both Parties obligations to deliver and receive Gas shall be reduced by the same percentage that Buyers Transporter or Sellers Transporter interrupts or curtails firm service at the Delivery Points on such Gas day Please note the reference to Article in s should be amended to a reference to Article once the changes indicated above are made Liquidated Damages Calculation The calculation of liquidated damages in s uses the highest daily price and lowest daily price in the index below However I could locate no reference to an index below to make the calculation As are result we need to specify an index We should probably insert a provision to deal with circumstances in which the index ceases to be reported or there is a material change in the formula for or method of calculation is changed as per the recent CPGR AECO C Daily Index changes Eligible Financial Contract Representation As a supplement to the provisions of s Enron Canada requires the following provisions to be added to the Master Eligible Financial Contract This Agreement all Transactions under this Agreement and any guarantee thereof as applicable each and together constitute an eligible financial contract under and in all proceedings related to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act Canada the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act Canada or the Windingup and Restructuring Act Canada as the same may be amended restated replaced or reenacted from time to time and will be treated similarly under and in all proceedings related to any bankruptcy insolvency or similar law regardless of the jurisdiction of application or competence of such law or any ruling order directive or pronouncement made pursuant thereto Assignment Enron Canada requires the assignment provisions of s be replaced with the following Transfer or Assignment Neither Party shall transfer or assign this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other Party which approval may be withheld or given entirely at the option of such Party provided however either Party may transfer or assign its interest hereunder to an affiliate subsidiary or to any person or entity succeeding to all or substantially all of the assets of such Party all without the prior written approval of the other Party but no such assignment will relieve the assigning Party of its obligations hereunder Further a new s should be inserted stating Enurement This Agreement shall enure to and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties hereto Canadian Law Issues Enron Canada requires the first two sentences of s to be replaced with the following This Agreement shall be governed by and construed enforced and performed in accordance with the laws in force in the Province of Alberta without regard to principles of conflicts of law and each Party hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta For the purposes of this Agreement and all Transactions hereunder unless otherwise specified dollars and the symbol means dollars in the lawful currency of Canada Representations Enron Canada requires the following section to be inserted

A few points I would send a clarifying memo and would speak specifically to Diane Seib and Peggy Hedstom to ensure for the time being that all physical and financial power transactions receive legal review This does not mean that LindaSharon have to document all of them rather we can still leave it up to documentation where appropriate But a lawyer needs to review all power confirms for the time being physical and financial to make sure that the product is being properly defined In terms of power product definition Milly has raised valid concerns which warrant legal review which are market opening risk change in market rules between now and market opening and the size of the transactions being entered into There is also the inherent risks of the PPA in essence interrutible risk All these risks need to managed at the front end ie Once a deal is executed by the trader the lawyer cannot fix it after the fact Although the power traders or originators should already understand these risks for the product when they are transacting please meet with Davies and Zufferli ASAP to ensure that they are cognizant of these risks when they are transacting Please check our corporate resolutions to make sure that they cover off execution of confirms for power transactions in a similar fashion to gas transactions ie anything over a year must be signed by Milly if it is less than a year it can be signed by Zufferli as the responsible trader or Davies as the responsible originator I note however for the time being at least until the market opens Milly wants to see all power trades regardless of tenor Peter Forwarded by Peter KeohaneCALECT on PM Rob Milnthorp AM To Greg CT cc Peter CT Subject Re Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process Greg ok with your process for the most part Would like to see all power swaps route through legal until the market is open operating and we have a complete understandingcomfort with the Alberta Market Frankly the size and magnitude of these swaps ie MW MW warrant legal looking at and me for that matter I think we dropped the ball when we sent out power swap confirms with little thought given to market opening risk change in rules rate caps etc These issues should have been thought through between commercial and legal before any swaps were executed In some respects we have now doubled down on our PPA exposure by entering into unconditional swaps Regards Milnthorp Greg Johnston AM To Mary CT Sharon CT Chris CT Mark E CT Peggy CT Tana CT Peter CT Jonathan CT Rob CT Mark CT Dianne CT Linda CT Mark CT John CT cc Subject Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process Further to a discussion with Mark Taylor I wanted to confirm our collective understandingproposal regarding the legal procedures associated with the financial trading process in Canada As you are all aware all financial confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm desk in Calgary However it seems that there has been some confusion relating to the legal procedures associated with this process In short I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for Canadian physical confirms That is as is currently the process for physical deals the commercial people will generate all deal tickets and to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward the Calgary confirm desk will generate have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation letters based upon those deal tickets with no involvement of the legal department However for any financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms as well as amendments just as with physical transactions the confirm desk will provide the deal ticket to Linda or Sharon in Calgary Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the deal tickets which will be reviewed and approved by either myself or Mark Powell Once approved the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing lawyer checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review approve and have executed by McKay Milnthorp or Zufferli as appropriate The executed confirm will then be returned to either Linda or Sharon who will attend to distributing it to the counterparty Again this will only be required for transactions which are out of the ordinary With respect to negotiating and implementing and addressing ongoing legal concerns with respect to ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada Mark Taylors group and I understand specifically Mary Cook will continue to have responsibility for such matters Therefore to the extent that we need to put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal concerns about the implementation of the ISDA the process will be the same as it has been in the past meaning that those matters will be dealt with in Houston Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations I think it is essential that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run each of Sharon and Linda as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggys group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters through her ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our legal group to deal with these matters As well we will need to ensure that Linda and Sharon receive either from Houston or Dianne electronic versions of all confirmation precedents ie confirm forms amendment forms etc necessary for them to properly undertake these activities If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above please do not hesitate to contact me Otherwise I think we should implement these procedures as soon as possible including having Tana join us for a few crisp winter days in Calgary Thanks Greg

<1629334.1075860187077.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,peter.keohane@enron.com,2001-01-25 08:25:00,Re Swap Question Cc I have a few comments To the extent that we are dealing with a BCA jurisduction I am not sure the issue is so much the common lawindoor management rule as the natural person powers of a BCA corporation In other words the doctrine of ultra vires does not apply to a BCA corpoartion which can do anything that is not specifically restricted by the BCA and generally speaking entering into physical or financial derivatives is not resticted The indoor management rule is also more relevant and generally incorporated in the applicable BCA Section of the ABCA for example and is subject to a qualification that we knew or by virtue of our position or relationship ought to have known that there was not proper corporate procedure followed by the counterparty Our general practice has been however that for an ordinary course BCA as we do not have such actual or imputed knowledge we can reasonably rely on the natural person powers and assumed corporate authority We also want to facilitate deal flow and avoid ourselves having to give numerous legal opinions Accordingly for a BCA we do not generally require legal opinions and this would be a fundamental change to prctices and procedures If the entity is a nonBCA jurisdiction corporation a statutory corporation including a municipality or Crown corporation a noncorporate entity a regulated entity etc we have cause to be more concerned not so much because of reasonableness defences to the common law indoor management rule but because of the the ultra vires doctrine or similartype defences ie These types of entities generally do not have natural person person powers and may only do that which is specifically authorized by the governing document statute agreement etc In other words even if the transactions have been properly approved or we are entitled to assume this is the case by the indoor management rule that does not save a transaction that is void for being ultra vires It is in these circumstances that we should be obtaining legal opinions As to enforceability I think we are generally comfortable that with proper corporate authority the Masters and the Transactions are enforceable and obtain reps in the agreements to that effect Accordingly for similar reasons we avoid giving and do not ask for enforceability opinions for ordinary course trading transactions I am copying Mark Taylor and Jeff Hodge to make sure that I am current on our polidy for legal opinions From Chris Gaffney on PM EST To Mary CT cc Peter CT Mark CT Subject Swap Question Mary If you would like any further research on the matter please let me know Regards CJG Forwarded by Chris GaffneyTORECT on PM Sellers Ward PM To cc Ponder Dale Subject Swap Question Chris I understand that Enron is contemplating entering into an ISDA agreement with a Canadian corporation that is whollyowned by an Ontario pension plan You have asked whether you need to get legal opinion as to authorization execution delivery and enforceability or can rely on the indoor management rule While you have not asked for a formal legal opinion on this matter I understand that you would like me to confirm the discussion you and I had on January on this matter The information set forth below is essentially what you and I discussed however since we talked I have received further input from on of my pensions partners and which has led me to be slightly more conservative on the enforceability opinion point In brief Even when dealing with an ordinary Canadian corporation it we generally recommend that our clients obtain a legal opinion from the counterparty as to capacity authority execution delivery and enforceability as a matter of prudence and in order to minimize legal risk Without the opinion you must rely on the indoor management rule as enshrined in most of our corporate statutes which is not bulletproof you would not be able to rely on the indoor management rule if you knew or ought to reasonably have known that the company or person did not have the purported authority to act While it may be difficult for a counterparty to establish that the indoor management rule is not available in a given circumstance it does reduce a companys legal risk to take this argument out of a plaintiff lawyers hands by getting the opinion You have informed me that on the basis of the foregoing while a legal opinion may be desirable you would not view it as strictly necessary and while this is ultimately a decision based upon risk tolerance as you are aware it is not unusual for those entering into swaps with ordinary corporations to conclude that the risk in this area is more theoretical than practical and to not go to the extent of requiring a legal opinion to protect themselves An additional issue however is whether the ownership of the corporation by a pension fund raises any additional reasons to obtain a legal opinion I am not aware of any cases on this point and our pension rules have recently been amended to regulate indirect and direct investments accordingly this is a case which is to a great degree an issue of first instance However my views are as to capacity authority execution and delivery the principles relating to the sanctity of the corporate veil should prevail and it would be an unusual result if the fact that the shares of the corporate entity are owned by a pension fund adversely affected the indoor management rule accordingly obtaining a legal opinion on these matters should not be more desirable when entering into a swap agreement with a company which is owned by a pension plan than when entering into such a contract with a company which

the rules governing the pension fund would taint the enforceability of a contract entered into by a whollyowned subsidiary thereof I can not tell you that enforceability would not be adversely affected accordingly an opinion as to enforceability may be more desirable when entering into a swap agreement with a company which is owned by a pension plan than when entering into such a contract

Morris SentTuesday June PM ToKeohane Peter Hedstrom Peggy Seib Dianne Scott Laura SubjectRE Financial Confirms Peter The usage of RMT is driven by a state tax planning structure that was imple mented in Simply put by intermediating intercompany trades thr ough RMT we are able to lower Enrons Texas Franchise Tax significantly in fact since rolling out the RMT structure we were able to reverse state in come tax reserves of approximately MM The Texas Franchise Tax is essentially a pseudo income tax that applies t o all companies doing business in the state of Texas Under the tax Texas sourced receipts are taxed at a rate of Income from intangible pro perty ie income from trading contracts is sourced based on the location of the payor In the case of corporations the location of the payor or legal domicile is where the mind and management of the company is located Obviously for ENA and most of the domestic Enron affiliates the legal do micile is Texas Thus prior to RMT all trades between ENA and the domes tic affiliates were sourced to Texas for franchise tax purposes which trad es were numerous as ENA was the risk management center for the Enron family RMT was established as a Delaware corporation with absolutely NO contac ts with Texas ie mind and management in Delaware with a business purpose of consolidating all of Enrons risk management activities By utilizing RMT as the counterparty on affiliate trades we are able to source a signifi cant portion of ENAs income away from Texas and suprisingly enough into Delaware which does not have an income based Franchise Tax The tension with the RMT structure is on the business purpose In other words we need to be very careful that we can show that RMT is acting as a true risk consolidating entity for Enron thus the reason for using RMT fo r international affiliatesincluding ECC With this in mind we need to document the trades with RMT meticulously must show that we document simil arly to what we do with third parties including confirming all of the tra des While I can appreciate that this causes quite a bit of administrative burden I think we should continue to confirm with RMT until we can show t hat it is no longer Enrons business practice to send out confirms Just FYI we just successfully completed a Texas franchise tax audit which uph eld the integrity of RMT but only after providing details as to how RMT pr operly documented the intercompany transactions Sorry to be so long winded but I thought you could appreciate some of the background Please give me a call so that we can discuss further

approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis We havent actually gotten there with anyone yet h aving just started the actual discussions this week Our plan was to negot iate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the mast er agreements where appropriate Initially we are only working on physical power physical natural gas and derivatives transactions other than weath er The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered This will obviously be a very timeconsuming and laborious process The initial list of or counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people Our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New

A few points I would send a clarifying memo and would speak specifically to Diane Seib and Peggy Hedstom to ensure for the time being that all physical and financial power transactions receive legal review This does not mean that LindaSharon have to document all of them rather we can still leave it up to documentation where appropriate But a lawyer needs to review all power confirms for the time being physical and financial to make sure that the product is being properly defined In terms of power product definition Milly has raised valid concerns which warrant legal review which are market opening risk change in market rules between now and market opening and the size of the transactions being entered into There is also the inherent risks of the PPA in essence interrutible risk All these risks need to managed at the front end ie Once a deal is executed by the trader the lawyer cannot fix it after the fact Although the power traders or originators should already understand these risks for the product when they are transacting please meet with Davies and Zufferli ASAP to ensure that they are cognizant of these risks when they are transacting Please check our corporate resolutions to make sure that they cover off execution of confirms for power transactions in a similar fashion to gas transactions ie anything over a year must be signed by Milly if it is less than a year it can be signed by Zufferli as the responsible trader or Davies as the responsible originator I note however for the time being at least until the market opens Milly wants to see all power trades regardless of tenor Peter Forwarded by Peter KeohaneCALECT on PM Rob Milnthorp AM To Greg CT cc Peter CT Subject Re Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process Greg ok with your process for the most part Would like to see all power swaps route through legal until the market is open operating and we have a complete understandingcomfort with the Alberta Market Frankly the size and magnitude of these swaps ie MW MW warrant legal looking at and me for that matter I think we dropped the ball when we sent out power swap confirms with little thought given to market opening risk change in rules rate caps etc These issues should have been thought through between commercial and legal before any swaps were executed In some respects we have now doubled down on our PPA exposure by entering into unconditional swaps Regards Milnthorp Greg Johnston AM To Mary CT Sharon CT Chris CT Mark E CT Peggy CT Tana CT Peter CT Jonathan CT Rob CT Mark CT Dianne CT Linda CT Mark CT John CT cc Subject Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process Further to a discussion with Mark Taylor I wanted to confirm our collective understandingproposal regarding the legal procedures associated with the financial trading process in Canada As you are all aware all financial confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm desk in Calgary However it seems that there has been some confusion relating to the legal procedures associated with this process In short I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for Canadian physical confirms That is as is currently the process for physical deals the commercial people will generate all deal tickets and to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward the Calgary confirm desk will generate have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation letters based upon those deal tickets with no involvement of the legal department However for any financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms as well as amendments just as with physical transactions the confirm desk will provide the deal ticket to Linda or Sharon in Calgary Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the deal tickets which will be reviewed and approved by either myself or Mark Powell Once approved the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing lawyer checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review approve and have executed by McKay Milnthorp or Zufferli as appropriate The executed confirm will then be returned to either Linda or Sharon who will attend to distributing it to the counterparty Again this will only be required for transactions which are out of the ordinary With respect to negotiating and implementing and addressing ongoing legal concerns with respect to ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada Mark Taylors group and I understand specifically Mary Cook will continue to have responsibility for such matters Therefore to the extent that we need to put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal concerns about the implementation of the ISDA the process will be the same as it has been in the past meaning that those matters will be dealt with in Houston Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations I think it is essential that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run each of Sharon and Linda as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggys group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters through her ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our legal group to deal with these matters As well we will need to ensure that Linda and Sharon receive either from Houston or Dianne electronic versions of all confirmation precedents ie confirm forms amendment forms etc necessary for them to properly undertake these activities If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above please do not hesitate to contact me Otherwise I think we should implement these procedures as soon as possible including having Tana join us for a few crisp winter days in Calgary Thanks Greg

<20221151.1075860254847.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,peter.keohane@enron.com,2001-01-25 08:25:00,Re Swap Question Cc I have a few comments To the extent that we are dealing with a BCA jurisduction I am not sure the issue is so much the common lawindoor management rule as the natural person powers of a BCA corporation In other words the doctrine of ultra vires does not apply to a BCA corpoartion which can do anything that is not specifically restricted by the BCA and generally speaking entering into physical or financial derivatives is not resticted The indoor management rule is also more relevant and generally incorporated in the applicable BCA Section of the ABCA for example and is subject to a qualification that we knew or by virtue of our position or relationship ought to have known that there was not proper corporate procedure followed by the counterparty Our general practice has been however that for an ordinary course BCA as we do not have such actual or imputed knowledge we can reasonably rely on the natural person powers and assumed corporate authority We also want to facilitate deal flow and avoid ourselves having to give numerous legal opinions Accordingly for a BCA we do not generally require legal opinions and this would be a fundamental change to prctices and procedures If the entity is a nonBCA jurisdiction corporation a statutory corporation including a municipality or Crown corporation a noncorporate entity a regulated entity etc we have cause to be more concerned not so much because of reasonableness defences to the common law indoor management rule but because of the the ultra vires doctrine or similartype defences ie These types of entities generally do not have natural person person powers and may only do that which is specifically authorized by the governing document statute agreement etc In other words even if the transactions have been properly approved or we are entitled to assume this is the case by the indoor management rule that does not save a transaction that is void for being ultra vires It is in these circumstances that we should be obtaining legal opinions As to enforceability I think we are generally comfortable that with proper corporate authority the Masters and the Transactions are enforceable and obtain reps in the agreements to that effect Accordingly for similar reasons we avoid giving and do not ask for enforceability opinions for ordinary course trading transactions I am copying Mark Taylor and Jeff Hodge to make sure that I am current on our polidy for legal opinions From Chris Gaffney on PM EST To Mary CT cc Peter CT Mark CT Subject Swap Question Mary If you would like any further research on the matter please let me know Regards CJG Forwarded by Chris GaffneyTORECT on PM Sellers Ward PM To cc Ponder Dale Subject Swap Question Chris I understand that Enron is contemplating entering into an ISDA agreement with a Canadian corporation that is whollyowned by an Ontario pension plan You have asked whether you need to get legal opinion as to authorization execution delivery and enforceability or can rely on the indoor management rule While you have not asked for a formal legal opinion on this matter I understand that you would like me to confirm the discussion you and I had on January on this matter The information set forth below is essentially what you and I discussed however since we talked I have received further input from on of my pensions partners and which has led me to be slightly more conservative on the enforceability opinion point In brief Even when dealing with an ordinary Canadian corporation it we generally recommend that our clients obtain a legal opinion from the counterparty as to capacity authority execution delivery and enforceability as a matter of prudence and in order to minimize legal risk Without the opinion you must rely on the indoor management rule as enshrined in most of our corporate statutes which is not bulletproof you would not be able to rely on the indoor management rule if you knew or ought to reasonably have known that the company or person did not have the purported authority to act While it may be difficult for a counterparty to establish that the indoor management rule is not available in a given circumstance it does reduce a companys legal risk to take this argument out of a plaintiff lawyers hands by getting the opinion You have informed me that on the basis of the foregoing while a legal opinion may be desirable you would not view it as strictly necessary and while this is ultimately a decision based upon risk tolerance as you are aware it is not unusual for those entering into swaps with ordinary corporations to conclude that the risk in this area is more theoretical than practical and to not go to the extent of requiring a legal opinion to protect themselves An additional issue however is whether the ownership of the corporation by a pension fund raises any additional reasons to obtain a legal opinion I am not aware of any cases on this point and our pension rules have recently been amended to regulate indirect and direct investments accordingly this is a case which is to a great degree an issue of first instance However my views are as to capacity authority execution and delivery the principles relating to the sanctity of the corporate veil should prevail and it would be an unusual result if the fact that the shares of the corporate entity are owned by a pension fund adversely affected the indoor management rule accordingly obtaining a legal opinion on these matters should not be more desirable when entering into a swap agreement with a company which is owned by a pension plan than when entering into such a contract with a company which is not the status of enforceability is less certain since there may be a number of additional factors which become relevant in assessing enforceability and while it would be somewhat of a surprise if the rules governing the pension fund would taint the enforceability of a contract entered into by a whollyowned subsidiary thereof I can not tell you that enforceability would not be adversely affected accordingly an opinion as to enforceability may be more desirable when entering into a swap agreement with a company which is owned by a pension plan than when entering into such a contract with a company which is not Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions on the foregoing or if you require any further information EA Ward Sellers Osler Hoskin Harcourt LLP tel fax
