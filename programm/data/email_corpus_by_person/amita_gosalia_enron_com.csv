NaturalGas Prices May Be Good For Consumers but Hinder New Production By Alexei Barrionuevo Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc In the wake of last months terrorist attacks naturalgas prices have slid below per million British thermal units frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in naturalgas projects Analysts predict that with prices at current levels projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the US could be shelved or canceled Naturalgas prices which reached highs of nearly per million BTUs last December had held to around to per million BTUs for much of the year At per million BTUs and below producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production Analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electricutility demand Nearby November futures fell cents yesterday to on the New York Mercantile Exchange In the Boston area however different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region Last week the US Coast Guard under pressure from local lawmakers indefinitely banned LNG tankers from entering Boston Harbor LNG makes up of New Englands gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days The Coast Guard and Department of Transportation are studying concerns that a LNG tanker could become a bomb for terrorists Already relative to other areas naturalgas prices have inched higher in New England where naturalgas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market The spread between prices in New England and the Gulf Coast widened last week by cents to per million BTUs said a spokeswoman for Distrigas a unit of Belgiums Tractebel SA But the lack of LNG isnt likely to become a big issue until winter hits and naturalgas storage is used up Richard Grant CEO of Distrigas says LNG has a year safety record at the companys Everett Mass terminal While LNG is flammable he says it is unlikely to explode He adds that there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual But until we answer the concerns we wont be able to bring a ship in here Deutsche Banc Alex Brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourthquarter projections for naturalgas prices last week Prior to Sept we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back said Jay Saunders a Deutsche Banc analyst But all that is out the window now Deutsche Banc is now estimating a drop in winter demand in the industrial sector which accounts for more than a quarter of total US naturalgas consumption The slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage which is on pace to be full by the end of October While prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future naturalgas demand is met Lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms such as EOG Resources Inc plan to moderate production in the next two months Gas drillingrig counts fell to last week from at the end of August Even with the increased naturalgas drilling of earlier this year overall naturalgas supply is expected to increase just this year as the countrys mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them The tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence Still the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form With prices high last winter El Paso Corp and Enron Corp among others said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas which is gas compressed and frozen to minus degrees Fahrenheit You will see some cancellations and some delays predicts Marshall Adkins an analyst with Raymond James Associates in Houston Naturalgas prices need to average per million BTUs on the East Coast and on the West Coast to justify bringing in LNG to those areas said Ronald Barone an analyst with UBS Warburg A spokeswoman for El Paso Houston says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the US market Enron said it

floor to Citibank The deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant Cushman Wakefield at a monthly rental of Rs per square foot With property prices in Mumbai having slumped and with

consultants to sell the premises at around Rs per square foot This is despite the fact that real estate at Bandra Kurla currently fetches Rs to Rs per square feet In June the US energy giant had

NaturalGas Prices May Be Good For Consumers but Hinder New Production By Alexei Barrionuevo Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc In the wake of last months terrorist attacks naturalgas prices have slid below per million British thermal units frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in naturalgas projects Analysts predict that with prices at current levels projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the US could be shelved or canceled Naturalgas prices which reached highs of nearly per million BTUs last December had held to around to per million BTUs for much of the year At per million BTUs and below producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production Analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electricutility demand Nearby November futures fell cents yesterday to on the New York Mercantile Exchange In the Boston area however different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region Last week the US Coast Guard under pressure from local lawmakers indefinitely banned LNG tankers from entering Boston Harbor LNG makes up of New Englands gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days The Coast Guard and Department of Transportation are studying concerns that a LNG tanker could become a bomb for terrorists Already relative to other areas naturalgas prices have inched higher in New England where naturalgas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market The spread between prices in New England and the Gulf Coast widened last week by cents to per million BTUs said a spokeswoman for Distrigas a unit of Belgiums Tractebel SA But the lack of LNG isnt likely to become a big issue until winter hits and naturalgas storage is used up Richard Grant CEO of Distrigas says LNG has a year safety record at the companys Everett Mass terminal While LNG is flammable he says it is unlikely to explode He adds that there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual But until we answer the concerns we wont be able to bring a ship in here Deutsche Banc Alex Brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourthquarter projections for naturalgas prices last week Prior to Sept we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back said Jay Saunders a Deutsche Banc analyst But all that is out the window now Deutsche Banc is now estimating a drop in winter demand in the industrial sector which accounts for more than a quarter of total US naturalgas consumption The slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage which is on pace to be full by the end of October While prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future naturalgas demand is met Lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms such as EOG Resources Inc plan to moderate production in the next two months Gas drillingrig counts fell to last week from at the end of August Even with the increased naturalgas drilling of earlier this year overall naturalgas supply is expected to increase just this year as the countrys mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them The tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence Still the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form With prices high last winter El Paso Corp and Enron Corp among others said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas which is gas compressed and frozen to minus degrees Fahrenheit You will see some cancellations and some delays predicts Marshall Adkins an analyst with Raymond James Associates in Houston Naturalgas prices need to average per million BTUs on the East Coast and on the West Coast to justify bringing in LNG to those areas said Ronald Barone an analyst with UBS Warburg A spokeswoman for El Paso Houston says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the US market Enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the Bahamas that would pipe the gas to Florida starting in Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Enron leases part of Mumbai estate to Citibank Freny Patel MUMBAI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard After months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at Wockhardt Towers in BandraKurla Complex Enron has been able lease out square feet of it to Citibank NA Against an expected realisation from Rs crore for the outright sale of its four floors Enron will get around Rs crore a year by leasing out one floor to Citibank The deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant Cushman Wakefield at a monthly rental of Rs per square foot With property prices in Mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the short run companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets Property consultants say that if Enron manages to lease out the entire four floors it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income Enron had eyed a deal of Rs crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around Rs per square foot This is despite the fact that real estate at Bandra Kurla currently fetches Rs to Rs per square feet In June the US energy giant had shelled out Rs crore when it acquired the four floors plus car park space from Wockhardt the pharmaceutical company The deal was struck at Rs per sq ft and included parking space for cars Industry sources said that Enron had spent a sum close to Rs crore to acquire the property and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired In order for it to break even it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of Rs per square foot Four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by Enron for the sale of its premises A leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property Most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase he added Moreover the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super builtup area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises and Enrons proposition continues to go abegging said the consultant

LowerProfile Women Topple More Wellknown Names From Tech and Internet Sector Ranking Includes Newcomers Though HewlettPackard lost billion in market value in a year CEO Carly Fiorina hasnt lost her nerve and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No position on FORTUNEs ranking of the Most Powerful Women in Business The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October issue of FORTUNE available on newsstands October and at wwwfortunecom at pm on October In the No spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman who runs an Internet company that actually makes money million in the last four quarters on million in revenue Oprah Winfrey the Queen of Media is mightier than ever and holds the No spot up from No last year She produces movies brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers propels books to bestsellerdom and last year teamed up with Hearst Magazines Cathie Black No on the list to publish O The Oprah Magazineby some measures the most successful magazine startup ever At No is Andrea Jung Chairman and CEO of Avon who has breathed life into ailing Avon Mirant CEO Marce Fullerthe only newcomer in the top fiveholds the No position Inside a stodgy utility Southern Fuller built a highgrowth trading and marketing unit which was spun off in April In these new more tempered times patience may be about to reap its reward In FORTUNEs annual survey of the Most Powerful Women in Business there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in Patient But Not Passive the story that accompanies the list By patience we mean staying with a company steadily building influence there and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge not promises and selfpromotion Fiorina who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNEs inaugural list in heads the biggest company billion in revenues last year run by a woman And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever Wall Street practically heckled her latest movea bold bet to buy Compaqbut Fiorina remains defiant In difficult times people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny she says As always the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time Last year power resided in the technology and Internet sectors but that influence was fleeting Gone from the list this year Deborah Hurricane Debby Hopkins who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May Ellen Hancock who failed at the startup Exodus and Morgan Stanleys Mary Meeker who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz But one Web warrior looks

where she is likely to go When appropriate we also weigh the womans influence on mass culture and society That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No on this years list The shifts on our list this year are dramatic with newcomers But one trend is especially intriguing Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever A few years ago responsibility for a billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list No more This years FORTUNE includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of billion or more which is a first In a related story It Took a Lady To Save Avon
