stock much higher Petapeer Holdings announced it ha s filed a Provisional Patent Application for a new proprietary technology that will implement systems and methods for bolstering the Gnutella

The last three weeks h ave led investors to believe there are other directions stocks can go besid es straight down There are many technology stocks trading at less than of their previous highs Stocks are so low the NASDAQ has suspended its m inimum bid rule for the remainder of the year and has announced it will review the rule early next year Unlike most market environments individ ual investors have a competitive advantage over fund managers with stocks a t these levels Most fund managers have thresholds below which they are not allowed to hold stocks Many funds cannot hold stocks below and others have a threshold Fund managers have been forced to sell stocks at thes e levels in order to comply with the rules of their fund oftentimes agains t their personal wishes and their own common sense Fund managers will be a ble to purchase these stocks again once they appreciate above and We are working on a list of stocks with compelling values that are very ove rsold In order to make the list the stock must be trading below the cash value the company has per share and have little or no debt We will try to publish this exciting edition next weekend We might call it the Riskless Rebound
