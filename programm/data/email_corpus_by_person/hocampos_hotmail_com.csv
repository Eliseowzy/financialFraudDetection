<9687612.1075852290681.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,hocampos@hotmail.com,2001-09-19 17:52:58,HiHello I apologize for the mass email How is everyone doing I hope everyones family and friends are doing fine In light of recent events I thought about all of you My family is doing fine Apparently one of my exroommates Indian guy was apparently beaten for looking middleeastern in San Francisco Unbelievable So whats up School is going quite well for me Im enjoying classes The people here are outgoing which is somewhat surprising since were all a bunch of math freaks Pittsburgh is no Houston but its bearable for a year I am a bit concerned with the job market this year Michael and Sheila any plans yet My best friend and his girlfriend are finally getting married this October after arduous years You got time obviously I had no luck with Gulay But I think it was unreasonable to expect anything I enjoyed it though Lenine how are things Have you seen The Tao of Steve yet How is your brother doing these

your FREE download of MSN Explorer at bqlhmtagitlENasp Inline attachment follows From To Jeganathan Lenine OENRONOUNACNRECIPIENTSCNLJEGANA Date Thursday September GMT Subject I found this posted on a site I visited and thought Id send it to you all Michael TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES This from a Canadian newspaper is worth sharing America The Good Neighbor Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair a Canadian television Commentator What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth Germany Japan and to a lesser extent Britain and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts None of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States When France was in dange r of collapsing in it was the Americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris I was there I saw it When earthquakes hit distant cities it is the United States that hurries in to help This spring American communities were flattened by tornadoes Nobody helped The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries Now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent warmongering Americans Id like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet the Lockheed TriStar or the Douglas DC If so why dont they fly them Why do all the Int ernational lines except Russia fly American Planes Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon not once but several times and safely home again You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at Even their draftdodgers are not pursued and hounded They are here on our streets and most of them unless they are breaking Canadian laws are getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here When the railways of France Germany and India were breaking down through age it was the Americans who rebuilt them When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke nobody loaned them an old caboose Both are still broke I can name you times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble I dont think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake Our neighbors have faced it alone and Im one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around They will come out of this thing with their flag high And when they do they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles I hope Canada is not one of those Stand proud America Wear it proudly This is one of the best editorials that I have ever read regarding the United States It is nice that one man realizes it I only wish that the rest of the world would realize it We are always blamed for everything and never even get a thank you for the things we do I would hope that each of you would send this to as many people as you can and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their friends until this letter is sent to every person on the web I am just a single American that has read this TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES This is an email I got that should be sent to everyone
