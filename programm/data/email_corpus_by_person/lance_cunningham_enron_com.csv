Stephen J Mitchell Email Tom Lee Email Walter Revell Email Subject Dow Jones Newswires Article on TX Stranded Cost Issue Dow Jones Newswires Texas PUC To Rule On Thorny StrandedCost Issue Dow Jones Newswires HOUSTON The Texas Public Utility Commission is set to unleash a hornets nest of protest from three investorowned utilities this week if it orders the electric firms to return billions of dollars to rate payers At issue is money the utilities have collected to offset expenses they contend will be left stranded when electric retail competition begins in Texas next year If the twomember PUC agrees with the proposed rulings it could be the first reversal of strandedcost recovery policy in the country The PUC is holding a twoday meeting Tuesday and Wednesday to complete its work on several contentious issues that must be resolved soon Texas is caught between early expectations that wholesale power prices would fall under deregulation and recent recognition that wholesale prices may not fall due to higher fuel costs Overrecovery of stranded costs past utility investment in generating units primarily nuclear power plants that may not be competitive in a deregulated electric market emerged with the dramatic rise in natural gas prices over the past year Higher priced gasfired generation makes nuclear power more competitive in Texas open market thereby reducing the stranded costs utilities expected say critics Texas PUC chairman Pat Wood and several Texas legislators are worried that ongoing efforts by TXU TXU unit TXU Electric Gas Reliant Energys REI Reliant HLP and American Electric Powers AEP Central Power Light to collect money to mitigate their stranded costs will result in excess recovery which could hurt new entrants and stifle early market competition The PUC wants to use revised strandedcost estimates to decide if ongoing mitigation efforts should be reversed When the Texas bill electric restructuring bill was passed in the trio of utilities expected total stranded costs to reach billion Updating the economic model to reflect higher natural gas prices eliminated the stranded costs and led to talk of negative stranded costs of nearly billion The utilities say they dont believe they are recovering excess dollars and argue that the PUC cant alter the mitigation process until when the Texas restructuring law calls for a final accounting procedure using actual market data not the economic model they call flawed They argue that if PUC estimates are wrong power prices will jump in Texas in They staunchly oppose the idea that customers should benefit from negative stranded costs By the end of the year TXU will have collected roughly billion Reliant about billion CPL about million The strandedcosts rulings are part of an unbundling process each Texas investorowned utility is undergoing to establish transmission and distribution rates In addition the PUC will set certain nonbypassable wires charges which will come into play as the state moves to a competitive retail electric market beginning in January TXU has said it will challenge any PUC ruling to change the mitigation process before In addition to the PUC effort a bill is under consideration in the Texas House of Representatives that addresses overrecovery and negative stranded costs not just for TXU Reliant and CPL but for other Texas utilities as well

Newswires HOUSTON The Texas Public Utility Commission is set to unleash a hornets nest of protest from three investorowned utilities this week if it orders the electric firms to return billions of dollars to rate payers At issue is money the utilities have collected to offset expenses they contend will be left stranded when electric retail competition begins in Texas next year If the twomember PUC agrees with the proposed rulings it could be the first reversal of strandedcost recovery policy in the country The PUC is holding a twoday meeting Tuesday and Wednesday to complete its work on several contentious issues that must be resolved soon Texas is caught between early expectations that wholesale power prices would fall under deregulation and recent recognition that wholesale prices may not fall due to higher fuel costs Overrecovery of stranded costs past utility investment in generating units primarily nuclear power plants that may not be competitive in a deregulated electric market emerged with the dramatic rise in natural gas prices over the past year Higher priced gasfired generation makes nuclear power more competitive in Texas open market thereby reducing the stranded costs utilities expected say critics Texas PUC chairman Pat Wood and several Texas legislators are worried that ongoing efforts by TXU TXU unit TXU Electric Gas Reliant Energys REI Reliant HLP and American Electric Powers AEP Central Power Light to collect money to mitigate their stranded costs will result in excess recovery which could hurt new entrants and stifle early market competition The PUC wants to use revised strandedcost estimates to decide if ongoing mitigation efforts should be reversed When the Texas bill electric restructuring bill was passed in the trio of utilities expected total stranded costs to reach billion Updating the economic model to reflect higher natural gas prices eliminated the stranded costs and led to talk of negative stranded costs of nearly billion The utilities say they dont believe they are recovering excess dollars and argue that the PUC cant alter the mitigation process until when the Texas restructuring law calls for a final accounting procedure using actual market data not the economic model they call flawed They argue that if PUC estimates are wrong power prices will jump in Texas in They staunchly oppose the idea that customers should benefit from negative stranded costs By the end of the year TXU will have collected roughly billion Reliant about billion CPL about million The strandedcosts rulings are part of an unbundling process each Texas investorowned utility is undergoing to establish transmission and distribution rates In addition the PUC will set certain nonbypassable wires charges which will come into play as the state moves to a competitive retail electric market beginning in January TXU has said it will challenge any PUC ruling to change the mitigation process before In addition to the PUC effort a bill is under consideration in the Texas House of Representatives that addresses overrecovery and negative stranded costs not just for TXU Reliant and CPL but for other Texas utilities as well
