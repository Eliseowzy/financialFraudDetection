PRIVATE Set forth is a brief summary of my call with John Pirog last night Overall I felt we made a lot of progress At the end of the call Pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible but at the end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our consideration on a few of the points We said that we would be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that we could then compare notes He said that CDWR viewed the Enron Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly quickly Material Regulatory Change Provision Pirog said CDWR would be willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects CDWRs ability to perform under the contract most particularly its ability to pay for power Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or regulatory generated change Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to a termination payment if this occurred although they may not want the MRC to be characterized as a default which should not be a problem from our standpoint CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change eg in law that materially affects EPMIs business but does not adversely affect CDWRs ability to make payments to EPMI For example a new CA law that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the CPUC Further as we anticipated he said CDWR was not willing to be on the hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control such as a FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us However he did say that CDWR might entertain a no LD walk right for EPMI if such a change adversely affected it My sense is that ultimately PirogCDWR will back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying LDs Early Walk Provision He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered it was discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk from the deal without receiving or paying a Termination Payment up until a date certain September and September were mentioned by me as possibilities although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA Treasurers office about the bond issue provided that if the bonds were issued earlier than that the walk away right would terminate that is EPMI would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date Termination Payment Due Date Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from days He said all other suppliers have lived with that Pirog is sympathetic to our concerns but said that the bond guys are already nervous about only having days if they had to issue bonds to pay the LDs Suspension of Delivery Emphasizing our concern with the days I requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend perfromance in the event of an event of default and perhaps some other events such as a bond downgrade Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with us on that Downgrade not a Default CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an event of default However he said CDWR would be willing to consider having a Downgrade Event a no LD walk right for EPMI and perhaps an event justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries In other words a Downgrade Event would be treated like an Event of Default but no termination payment would be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance Pirog also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event that no bonds were issued That is if no Bonds were outstanding and the Fund did not have an investment grade rating we could terminate but without LDs Cross Defaults This clearly is one of CDWRs hot buttons and we will not be able to get this is my sense However when asked about the idea of a Cross Default Out wout a termination payment he stated that he would like to discuss that further with CDWR LD Calculation Methodology Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would accept our proposed language He said they are striving for consistency among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more objective My sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general Arbitration In general Pirog did not have a problem except for the following a desire to limit it to contractual claims only ie no tort actions extracontractual disputes etc would be subject to it Also holding hearings in New York City was not well received and a request was made that all three arbitrators be neutral I would think that the situs issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise My general sense however is that this is not a deal breaker for CDWR Assignment In general he understood the nature of our changes on this issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue as well they are looking for some consistency We were again asked if assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable even though he knew what our reaction would be Pirog offered to provide us sample language which we said we would look at We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult sell in light of the environment He did not elaborate on how stringent the assignment standards are in the other deals New Govt Charge Pass Throughs A pass through of some governmental charges was considered to be okay but he said our proposed language was too broad Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this He di agre howeve that if for example CA imposed an excess profits tax that it was fair for us to be protected from that Legal Opinions Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would be forthcoming although he did say that he would look into whether or not they would be providing one on the bonds Also he said it was a possibility that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds so we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins Realistically it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to extend the option perhaps we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that before our walk right expires Additional CDWR Covenants Pirog stated that the additional covenants we have requested are conceptually okay with him but need to be discussed internally with CDWR Pro Rata Spread Amortization Pirog had not reviewed the idea of amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term and said that he would run it by CDWR CDWR Information Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it plans to give suppliers financial information He was resisting our request for monthly information although I pointed out that we really only wanted information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things start to fall into place Let me know when you wish to follow up John This email including attachments contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorneyclient or other

<7381805.1075847414115.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,elizabeth.sager@enron.com,2001-03-15 08:44:00,per my vmForwarded by Elizabeth SagerHOUECT on PM JOHN G KLAUBERG LGMCOM AM To cc Subject Call with Pirog PRIVATE Set forth is a brief summary of my call with John Pirog last night Overall I felt we made a lot of progress At the end of the call Pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible but at the end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our consideration on a few of the points We said that we would be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that we could then compare notes He said that CDWR viewed the Enron Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly quickly Material Regulatory Change Provision Pirog said CDWR would be willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects CDWRs ability to perform under the contract most particularly its ability to pay for power Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or regulatory generated change Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to a termination payment if this occurred although they may not want the MRC to be characterized as a default which should not be a problem from our standpoint CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change eg in law that materially affects EPMIs business but does not adversely affect CDWRs ability to make payments to EPMI For example a new CA law that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the CPUC Further as we anticipated he said CDWR was not willing to be on the hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control such as a FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us However he did say that CDWR might entertain a no LD walk right for EPMI if such a change adversely affected it My sense is that ultimately PirogCDWR will back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying LDs Early Walk Provision He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered it was discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk from the deal without receiving or paying a Termination Payment up until a date certain September and September were mentioned by me as possibilities although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA Treasurers office about the bond issue provided that if the bonds were issued earlier than that the walk away right would terminate that is EPMI would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date Termination Payment Due Date Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from days He said all other suppliers have lived with that Pirog is sympathetic to our concerns but said that the bond guys are already nervous about only having days if they had to issue bonds to pay the LDs Suspension of Delivery Emphasizing our concern with the days I requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend perfromance in the event of an event of default and perhaps some other events such as a bond downgrade Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with us on that Downgrade not a Default CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an event of default However he said CDWR would be willing to consider having a Downgrade Event a no LD walk right for EPMI and perhaps an event justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries In other words a Downgrade Event would be treated like an Event of Default but no termination payment would be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance Pirog also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event that no bonds were issued That is if no Bonds were outstanding and the Fund did not have an investment grade rating we could terminate but without LDs Cross Defaults This clearly is one of CDWRs hot buttons and we will not be able to get this is my sense However when asked about the idea of a Cross Default Out wout a termination payment he stated that he would like to discuss that further with CDWR LD Calculation Methodology Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would accept our proposed language He said they are striving for consistency among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more objective My sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general Arbitration In general Pirog did not have a problem except for the following a desire to limit it to contractual claims only ie no tort actions extracontractual disputes etc would be subject to it Also holding hearings in New York City was not well received and a request was made that all three arbitrators be neutral I would think that the situs issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise My general sense however is that this is not a deal breaker for CDWR Assignment In general he understood the nature of our changes on this issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue as well they are looking for some consistency We were again asked if assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable even though he knew what our reaction would be Pirog offered to provide us sample language which we said we would look at We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult sell in light of the environment He did not elaborate on how stringent the assignment standards are in the other deals New Govt Charge Pass Throughs A pass through of some governmental charges was considered to be okay but he said our proposed language was too broad Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this He di agre howeve that if for example CA imposed an excess profits tax that it was fair for us to be protected from that Legal Opinions Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would be forthcoming although he did say that he would look into whether or not they would be providing one on the bonds Also he said it was a possibility that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds so we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins Realistically it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to extend the option perhaps we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that before our walk right expires Additional CDWR Covenants Pirog stated that the additional covenants we have requested are conceptually okay with him but need to be discussed internally with CDWR Pro Rata Spread Amortization Pirog had not reviewed the idea of amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term and said that he would run it by CDWR CDWR Information Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it plans to give suppliers financial information He was resisting our request for monthly information although I pointed out that we really only wanted information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things start to fall into place Let me know when you wish to follow up John This email including attachments contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorneyclient or other

Elizabeth CT cc Subject FYI Western Power Market Stands Poised on the Precipice According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting Groups Bulk Power Outlook FAIRFAX Va June PRNewswire Power markets in the Western System Coordinating Council are poised on the precipice of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer and next according to a new study of the regional market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group The West stands at least a one in three chance of experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during the summer of said Judah Rose a Senior Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study ICFs analysis of the West points to a number of key nearterm implications Regional Capacity Deficits The region is in a delicate supplydemand balance with most subregions of the West relying on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet nearterm peak capacity requirements Because demand growth is outpacing new supply additions those deficits will only become more extreme over the next two years Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence A fifth consecutive year of aboveaverage hydroelectric generation the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus will again mask the Wests precarious supplydemand balance in However if the drought conditions of the early s resurface the West will find itself at an even greater risk of price spikes Upward Pressure on Prices Prices are on an upward trend for and the result of both higher regional spot natural gas prices and the increasing value of pure capacity the value of ensuring reliability for consumers The study also evaluates the longterm future of the Western market and highlights the following key results Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily The regions underlying demand growth is strong creating a longterm regional capacity need totaling more than MW by unless there is a serious economic downturn in the region Energy Prices Trending Downward The trend for longterm energy prices is for negative real growth through but the region will remain susceptible to nearterm volatility while market institutions continue to evolve and new supply is slowly added over the next few years Capacity Prices Rising Slowly Current low capacity values will continue to rise but still remain below many other regions as new more efficient generation is added Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices Gas demand for power generation is poised to more than double by with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest subregions Even so the West regions vast gas supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little if any real price appreciation through The Western US Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook along with the

Carr on PM To Christi L CT cc Subject Christi this is generating a lot of interest Christi this is generating a lot of interest By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesEt tu Sonnet The Edison Electric Institute unveiled Wednesday a standardized master agreement for trading power but theres already a standard contract the one written by the Western Systems Power Pool There are several ways to characterize this battle East versus West power marketers versus utilities and even Southern Co versus Southern Co A power struggle has begun despite the fact that most traders preschedulers and trading managers arent even aware of the new contract Southern Co SO Vice President Bobby Campo has been a leader in WSPP since the organizations inception and has been chairman of its contract committee for four years Yet Southern Co Energy Marketings chief counsel Sonnet Edmonds is a leader in the rivalcontract faction Will EEI along with its comrade the National Energy Marketers Association manage to dethrone the WSPP contract or crash WSPPs raison detre is to manage and promote use of its contract which is traded extensively in the West and has gained proponents in the East Im not real excited about it right now Campo said of the new contract The EEI contract is being done by contract people and lawyers We operators and power marketers worked on our contract for years before we brought in the lawyers It the new contract may die from a lack of interest from participants but EEI has the ability to keep it alive It isnt clear if the big power marketing companies will get the ball rolling by asking counterparties to switch to the EEI contract Edmonds hopes that Southern Co will do so Management hasnt given the official word yet but we participated in its development so I imagine well use it at some point she said Enron Corps ENE general counsel also worked on the EEI contract but the company hasnt made a decision to actually use it Entergy Corps ETR general counsel Christopher Bernard led the effort to develop the new contract as head of NEMs standardized contract committee But Entergys Jim Kenney is chairman of WSPPs executive committee Entergys power trading managers meanwhile havent even read the new contract yet Duke Power Co DUK an NEM member is looking at it a spokesman said Enron and Southern Co arent NEM members though they serve on its contract committee Several sources said American Electric Power AEP has agreed to be the guinea pig and plans to switch to the EEI contract with counterparties on eastern US trades A spokesman for the utility couldnt confirm or deny that rumor because Paul Addis president of AEP Energy Services has imposed a vow of silence on AEPs traders There are elements of the EEI contract that power marketers may like One innovation is a new product called Firm No Force Majeure which requires the payment of liquidated damages for failure to deliver no excuses no force majeure just send a check The new contract also has two other firm products Firm Liquidated Damages is closest to the WSPP firm product but it defines force majeure more strictly than WSPP Firm LDSystem Reliability explicitly allows a selling utility to curtail deliveries without paying liquidated damages if necessary to maintain native load Of particular interest to traders of eastern US electricity is the fact that the EEI contract defines what an into product is WSPP has debated the introduction of such products but in the end has tried to come up with a single agreedupon product for trading EEI has created a lot of different types of firm products but that can create problems Many people have said no we want one firm product said WSPPs counsel Michael Small of Washington DC law firm Wright and Talisman So why didnt the EEI group just work with WSPP to get changes made to the existing standard Too much bureaucracy according to Southerns Edmonds Changes to the WSPP contract require approval from of the members after working through the operations committee and the executive committee Then the changes have to be filed at Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Edmonds said Coincidentally WSPPs executive committee is meeting Friday in San Diego to discuss what changes are needed in the definition of its firm product Western utilities are pushing hard for firm to mean backed up by reserves of generating assets or previously purchased power In other words some utilities want to eliminate short positions from power markets At least one power marketing company which didnt want to be named will switch to the EEI contract if that change gets made to WSPP For the EEI contract to fly not only will the lawyers at the big trading companies need to make it their companies standard but traders will have to convince utilities to abandon most if not all force majeure claims Many municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives are forbidden to do so by state regulations For traders though the biggest adjustment to make if the EEI contract does take off will be more social than professional The semiannual meeting of the WSPPs operations committee is as much fun as any blatant boondoggle should be The serious work of a handful of committee members is a small hook on which hangs the revelry of hundreds of power marketers brokers and utility staffers As it stands noncommittee members must have a hard time convincing bosses that their presence is necessary at the meeting How on earth will traders justify going if the WSPP contract is no longer used Can EEI throw a good party And how will the Gucciloafered EEI executives from Washington handle dares to go naked in a bar Such are the questions now vexing Americas electric utilities By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires Copyright c

Copyright Houston Chronicle Proarena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday pitching the million plan to a grassroots group of Latino leaders More than community activists and leaders precinct judges and civicassociation members attended an informational meeting and getoutthevote rally for the Nov arena referendum The rally was sponsored by the Lets Build It Together political action committee By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this it empowers us said Celina GarzaRidge a Harris CountyHouston Sports Authority director Its very important to be able to say the Hispanic community made a difference and we are exactly in that position George Postolos the Houston Rockets chief operating officer said the team is actively courting the Hispanic community The proarena committee headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan and Ken Lay Enron chairman and chief executive officer does not want a repeat of the referendum Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal The sports authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and county to oversee and develop sports venues The Rockets made a percent participation commitment similar to the one made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field to fairly share the new arenas design and construction jobs with minorities and women The team also promised to distribute up to a year in neighborhood improvement grants of up to each to worthy grassroots nonprofit organizations and civic clubs in innercity Houston The new program targets the Hispanic community Postolos said The new arena plan is being endorsed by a crosssection of Latino leaders including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez state Rep Mario Gallegos the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city and the Hispanic community is getting more tangibles this time around He said When you consider that our community will get percent affirmative action that our youth will be taken care of through youth outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well this is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the Hispanic community Mercedes Alejandro who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston heard the details of the plan for the first time Its good if it creates jobs for the community and opportunities to rebuild the community she said We want it to be good for the whole not the few Humberto Barrera president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization was critical of Hispanic leaders not the arena plan I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay raises for teachers health care and public safety than building arenas for rich entrepreneurs Barrera said Richard Torres director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce told attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing Sergio

Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost Mln By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow Jones The nations top two power providers are battling in a US court over an unexecuted power sales agreement The Tennessee Valley Authority TVA has filed a claim against the power marketing unit of Enron Corp ENE alleging breach of a power sales contract TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen expenses contributing to the governmentowned utilitys inability to meet its debtreduction forecast According to the documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires the alleged breach of contract contributed to a million shortfall during fiscal year TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case which is under a court protective order A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract said David Smith TVAs chief financial officer when asked Friday to elaborate on the line item in the information provided to TVAs distribution utility customers But after consulting with attorneys Smith revealed that Enron was the subject of the claim TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment order from the US District Court in Chattanooga Tenn in February stemming from a dispute over a longterm sales agreement an Enron spokesman said Monday In March TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of contract a TVA spokesman said Monday But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract or to elaborate further on the dispute citing the judges protective order TVA said Enron sought the court seal The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houstonbased energy giant and TVA a governmentowned utility that ranks among the largest US power producers The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to the lucrative US Midwest power market which saw extreme price spikes during hot weather in the summers of and After the summer of in which power that typically sells for between and per megawatthour spiked as high as per megawatthour Enron cited a study showing that TVAs power grid represented the only unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were spiking upward Enron built gasfired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access across TVAs system After the summer of saw a repeat in extreme price volatility Enron began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service requests A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement over the government utilitys handling of transmissionaccess requests But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public with its complaints about TVAs transmission service In February Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson asking for the governments help charging that TVA was unfairly giving its own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enrons requests were gathering dust Enron later dropped the matter saying that TVA was processing its transmission service requests on a timely basis By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

Dispute PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT DO NOT DISTRIBUTE Elizabeth I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY While I think we should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone I nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary focal points for those discussions particularly if you dont get to this for a few days I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some comments as I was thinking through some of the issuespositions Also Ill have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office but I thought I could generally review the PPA in any event In addition I did not know whether it was ENAs or Dynegys obligation to work on a response to CMS but I thought it made some sense to see what one might look like on paper See attached At this point however Im not sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contractbased rationale in writing to CMS as to MPLPs position that the capacity charges should be adjusted on a calendar year basis You will note that the draft letter focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract Capacity Factor which clearly is done on a calendar year basis rather than the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D As noted below there are some issues underlying this position Preliminary Overall Assessment The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year basiswhich generally supports MPLPs positionthe effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies namely the stated capacity charge on Exhibit D for Year only would apply for months but even more importantly the capacity charge on Exhibit D for Year would apply for the last months of the Contract Term The anomaly running in the other direction is that under CMSs interpretation various computations would be made on a calendar year basis eg Contract Capacity Factor and adjustments resulting therefrom would be applied midstream ie after months of the alleged contract year My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly described above that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year concept ie the month Year issue since that is a fairly easy concept to get your arms around More InformationDiligenceResearch Before a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made we likely would want to review or undertake as the case may be some additional informationdiligenceresearch such as which I assume we could generally obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the email you forwarded The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA prior to the first amendment in a published Order Was there anything in that Order or the submissions or exhibits thereto including financial projections that might provide some guidance My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance where the COD was not a Jan Do we or local counsel know whether this may be a global attack by CMS on these types of PPAs While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the excess capacity payments from its customersso that it presumably would have to issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims CMS self bills itself under the PPA Has the statute of limitations run on any of its claims for refunds for prior years Can CMSs prior course of dealing be used to support MPLPs contractual interpretation or is there otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior overpayments as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity payments This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis only The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC Isnt this determination to be made over the life of the PPA rather than for any particular period Assuming CMSs statement is correct I assume it does not affect the validity of the PPA but only whether CMS can recover the excess amount in rates Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the PUC If so can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall restructuring of the PPA Certain Points in Support of MPLPs Position The definition of Contract Capacity Factor provides for a calendar year determination and most importantly provides for a partial year calculation for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar year If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the COD date it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation Sec a provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity Factor is less than then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows The capacity charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined Emphasis added This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year not on the next anniversary of the COD It arguably would not appear to make any sense to apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis but determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not require an adjustment NOTE The counterargument however is that the foregoing language only pertains to the computation of a percentage haircut or adjustment that is applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D whatever those may be rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective That is making this adjustment on a calendar year basis even though the scheduled capacity rates change each October is not necessarily in conflict with the rest of the PPA Sec b Effective Date and Term provides that the Agreement runs for years and thereafter from year to year unless a party gives at least one years notice to terminate which termination shall be effective at the end of the years or any calendar year thereafter Emphasis added Thus for example if one month after the end of the year termie October a party gave notice to terminate such termination would be effective December not September or September ie not on the anniversary dates of the COD Thus the PPA contemplates in certain respects certain stub years and certain long years a contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLPs position on the stub and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D There are other calendar year based obligationsfor eg Sec and Exhibit B reflect termination payments that again are calculated on a calendar year basis We should discuss with the commercial people the economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be additional support in that respect Note that some other calendar year based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA but can still be used to reflect the underlying calendar year flavor of the PPA since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment A Few Additional Points to Note The PPA is devoid of default language LDs etc however MPLP could bring a claim against CMS to arbitration Sec for what it believes it is owed when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in plus interest as provided at Sec and keep performing under the PPA Although I do not see a significant issue here lets briefly discuss the potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an indication of a regulatory disallowance pursuant to Sec c as a way to attempt to force its contract year interpretation of Exhibit D While Sec c is one of those old school one way regulatory outs MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec e requiring CMS to defend the PPA to prevent CMSs affirmatively use of the PUC to support its contract claim In Pennsylvania PECO in an analogous circumstance attempted to use a PUC determination as justification to attempt to break a PPA with a QF Let me know when you wish to follow up John This email including attachments contains information

February PM To State Restructuring Service Members List Serve Cc Lawrence Logan Maria Veiga Subject State Restructuring CA PUC Adopts DWR Regulations ReRegulates Utility Generation California PUC Adopts DWR Regulations ReRegulates Utility Generation DWR power to go only to SCE and PGE customers for now Obligates SCE and PGE to make DWR whole for its unrecovered costs Reregulates all generation retained by the IOUs Each to file costbased rates Rate base to be net depreciated book value less recovered stranded costs The California PUC adopted emergency regulations for the delivery and payment mechanisms the states Department of Water Resources DWR will use in fulfilling its electric purchase and sale obligations under emergency bill AB X Under the provisions of AB X which the PUC apparently had confidence would be enacted without significant change the PUC requires the DWR to sell the power it purchases directly to the retail end use customers of Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas Electric PGE Since the law requires the PUC to ensure that DWR recovers all of the costs of its power purchase program and yet also limits the recovery to only an allocable portion of the utilities currently frozen energy charges the PUC recognizes the possibility that DWRs costs may not be fully recovered at certain times The PUC makes SCE and PGE liable to pay any shortfalls to ensure DWR recovers its costs on as current a basis as possible but suggests it is open to further consideration of this policy URG Assets ReRegulated The PUC orders the three utilities to each make Advice Letter filings to establish costbased rates for their URG The rate set will be made retroactive to whenever the utility stopped bidding its retained generation into to the PX which SCE and PGE said they stopped doing on The two utilities said they stopped participating in the PX dayof and dayahead markets on The PUC directs the utilities to calculate their cost of capitalrelated revenue requirements using the amounts in their respective Transition Cost Balancing Accounts TCBA as the rate base The TCBA reflects the net book value of utility generation assets less the recovery of those assets stranded costs The PUC will allow utilities to record in a memorandum account the difference between this reduced rate of return component of revenue requirements and their last PUC authorized rate of return for the same assets for possible future use in adjusting the TCBAbased rates The amounts in these memorandum accounts will represent the difference between their current allowed returns and what they may have earned had these generation costs been recovered under traditional cost of service ratemaking in place prior to restructuring The costbased rates so determined the PUC says would comply with the principle that ratepayers pay just and reasonable rates and as costs change would be subject to adjustment The PUC decides that SCE PGE and San Diego Gas Electric SDGE should use their utility retained generation URG in the following order to serve their existing customers at costofservice based rates sell power at costbased rates to other California investorowned utilities and sell or barter excess power from URG to minimize future costs The PUC directs that if any surplus generation exists it should first be offered to other California IOUs at costbased rates with any net proceeds to benefit instate ratepayers URG consists of utilityowned generation and longterm purchased power contracts Since the December order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC ending the investorowned utilities obligation to sell all of their energy produced through the Power Exchange PX and buy all of their energy requirements from the PX the socalled buysell requirement utilities had no regulatory direction for using and pricing their retained generation In lieu of an evidentiary hearing because of the need to protect the public interest during this time of nearly continuous Stage supply emergencies the PUC now provides this direction The PUC makes SDGE a party to the URG aspects of its order while the PUC does not apply the DWR delivery and pricing rules to SDGE at this time The AB X law does not exclude SDGEs retail customers from receiving DWR power but the PUC opts not to require DWR power to go them at this time In this interim order adopted on the PUC says it does not end the rate freeze set an interim valuation or otherwise provide a basis for ending the rate freeze As far as it addresses the pricing and use of utilities retained generation the order only sets an interim basis for pricing the power utilities continue to produce and provide to their customers since the effectively defunct PX no longer fulfills this function Residual Pricing of DWR Power Because of the provisions of AB X which was enacted the day after the PUC adopted its order the PUC must price DWR power residually or as a percentage of what each SCE and PGE retail end use customer currently pays them for energy The utilities energy charges are currently frozen at different levels for each utility and each customer class The percentage is calculated by dividing the amount of power provided by DWR and delivered by the utility by the total amount of power generated or purchased by the utility and the amount of power in item The amount of power purchased by the utility includes purchases from QFs and others for resale as well as any energy they purchase in the ISOs real time market This percentage or ratio will be calculated daily The PUC provides the following example if a utility generates and purchases MWh of power and delivers along with it MWh of DWR power for a total of MWh each customer owes DWR of the energy charge in their rates for the power they used that day Utilities will collect these amounts from customers on behalf of DWR and hold the amounts in trust for DWR As the law requires the calculation of the amounts to be collected on the basis of the megawatt hours DWR actually purchases and delivers while calculating the amounts it is entitled to recover from utilities retail customers in dollars of costs there is a built in potential for DWRs costs to be under recovered depending on how the actual price DWR pays for each MWh matches up with the utilities existing frozen energy charges The PUC says that making the utilities liable for any shortfall in the recovery of DWRs costs satisfies the legislative concern that the State recover the funds expended If the two cashstrapped nearly bankrupt utilities are liable for substantial amounts to make DWR whole these amounts would likely only add to the approximately billion in unpaid overdue purchased power costs they have already accumulated Following the provisions of AB X the PUC sets the DWR price of power upon resale as equal to DWRs purchased power costs plus administrative costs transmission and scheduling costs and other related costs less any overpayments DWR may subsequently recover from suppliers Again following the provisions of AB X the PUC directs DWR to retain title to its power until sold to the utilities retail end use customers and reminds that under the new statute neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California may be pledged for the payment for any obligation The PUC orders the two cashstrapped utilities to deliver DWR power to retail customers and directs the utilities to take no ownership or other interest in DWR power acting only in an administrative capacity as billing

PRIVATE Set forth is a brief summary of my call with John Pirog last night Overall I felt we made a lot of progress At the end of the call Pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible but at the end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our consideration on a few of the points We said that we would be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that we could then compare notes He said that CDWR viewed the Enron Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly quickly Material Regulatory Change Provision Pirog said CDWR would be willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects CDWRs ability to perform under the contract most particularly its ability to pay for power Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or regulatory generated change Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to a termination payment if this occurred although they may not want the MRC to be characterized as a default which should not be a problem from our standpoint CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change eg in law that materially affects EPMIs business but does not adversely affect CDWRs ability to make payments to EPMI For example a new CA law that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the CPUC Further as we anticipated he said CDWR was not willing to be on the hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control such as a FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us However he did say that CDWR might entertain a no LD walk right for EPMI if such a change adversely affected it My sense is that ultimately PirogCDWR will back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying LDs Early Walk Provision He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered it was discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk from the deal without receiving or paying a Termination Payment up until a date certain September and September were mentioned by me as possibilities although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA Treasurers office about the bond issue provided that if the bonds were issued earlier than that the walk away right would terminate that is EPMI would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date Termination Payment Due Date Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from days He said all other suppliers have lived with that Pirog is sympathetic to our concerns but said that the bond guys are already nervous about only having days if they had to issue bonds to pay the LDs Suspension of Delivery Emphasizing our concern with the days I requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend perfromance in the event of an event of default and perhaps some other events such as a bond downgrade Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with us on that Downgrade not a Default CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an event of default However he said CDWR would be willing to consider having a Downgrade Event a no LD walk right for EPMI and perhaps an event justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries In other words a Downgrade Event would be treated like an Event of Default but no termination payment would be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance Pirog also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event that no bonds were issued That is if no Bonds were outstanding and the Fund did not have an investment grade rating we could terminate but without LDs Cross Defaults This clearly is one of CDWRs hot buttons and we will not be able to get this is my sense However when asked about the idea of a Cross Default Out wout a termination payment he stated that he would like to discuss that further with CDWR LD Calculation Methodology Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would accept our proposed language He said they are striving for consistency among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more objective My sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general Arbitration In general Pirog did not have a problem except for the following a desire to limit it to contractual claims only ie no tort actions extracontractual disputes etc would be subject to it Also holding hearings in New York City was not well received and a request was made that all three arbitrators be neutral I would think that the situs issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise My general sense however is that this is not a deal breaker for CDWR Assignment In general he understood the nature of our changes on this issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue as well they are looking for some consistency We were again asked if assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable even though he knew what our reaction would be Pirog offered to provide us sample language which we said we would look at We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult sell in light of the environment He did not elaborate on how stringent the assignment standards are in the other deals New Govt Charge Pass Throughs A pass through of some governmental charges was considered to be okay but he said our proposed language was too broad Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this He di agre howeve that if for example CA imposed an excess profits tax that it was fair for us to be protected from that Legal Opinions Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would be forthcoming although he did say that he would look into whether or not they would be providing one on the bonds Also he said it was a possibility that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds so we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins Realistically it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to extend the option perhaps we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that before our walk right expires Additional CDWR Covenants Pirog stated that the additional covenants we have requested are conceptually okay with him but need to be discussed internally with CDWR Pro Rata Spread Amortization Pirog had not reviewed the idea of amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term and said that he would run it by CDWR CDWR Information Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it plans to give suppliers financial information He was resisting our request for monthly information although I pointed out that we really only wanted information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things

contract is the EEI Master let me know if you need that standard form Call w any questionscomments Elizabeth Forwarded by Elizabeth SagerHOUECT on PM JOHN G KLAUBERG LGMCOM AM To cc MICHAEL W E DIDRIKSEN LGMCOM Subject Revised Draft John as per your request attached are revised drafts of the Confirmation and Cover Sheet which are blacklined against the respective documents from the shortterm deal I recognize that you are still reviewing certain questionspoints with CDWR and there may be some items reflected in this draft that neither you nor CDWR has signed off on Nonetheless in certain cases I thought it made sense to provide you with specific contract language on some of the points we discussed so that you could clearly see what we may be proposing on a particular item Please note in particular the following on the LD calculation we reverted to your proposed language on obtaining multiple market quotes etc However after talking to Enron this evening we would like to propose that if quotes cannot be obtained despite the parties good faith efforts to do so then only in that circumstance would the calculation be based on the NonDefaulting Partys losses While based on the product Enron is selling we anticipate that quotes will be readily obtainable we think it makes sense to revert to the NonDefaulting Partys loss calculation in the highly unlikely event that quotes are not obtainable despite using all efforts to do so I know that you expressed some reservations the other evening that this process potentially could be subject to some manipulation This is not so If CDWR was the Defaulting Party and it disputes the loss calculation made by Enron such dispute would become the subject of arbitration In such case the NonDefaulting Partys would have to furnish its historical and current power curves to prove its case Since those same figures necessarily are needed by Enron to report its trading positions on a day to day basis as part of its normal business operations and such information feeds directly into its financial reporting statements and other relevant financial information etc that becomes in part part of its SEC filings in a discovery proceeding this information would be very transparent with respect to the situs of any arbitration proceeding Enron strongly believes that it is only fair to both parties that this be conducted in a neutral site The draft provides for New York City although Enron is open to other possible locations the revised draft reflects only the MWh alternative scenario since you indicated that preliminarily you felt that CDWR would not be likely to choose the alternative structure we had discussed we would like to further discuss the effect of an adverse federal regulatory change Im sure you can appreciate this in light of the current environment although we would think that freely negotiated bilateral contracts would not be subject to the types of changes being discussed Enron is not seeking a termination right with LDs but would like to further discuss a termination right without compensation in the event of a major adverse federal development affecting the contract we have dropped our request that Enron have the right to suspend performance in the case of a Bond downgrade event However we think it is appropriate that if that circumstance occurs that the due date for payments by CDWR should shorten to days and if the Bonds are subsequently upgraded that the payment schedule would revert accordingly you requested that we propose a limit on the right of a NonDefaulting Party to suspend its performance in the case of a Default by the Defaulting Party We included a NERC day limit on such right in the revised draft This is important to Enron as we discussed particularly in light of Enrons acceptance of the day period on the timing of a Termination Payment which as you know is unheard of in the power sale or virtually any other arena Nonetheless we fully understand the position enunciated by the bond people on this point on assignment the Enron commercial people cannot agree to a preapproved right of CDWR to assign the contract to the IOUs As we discussed it may very well be the case that at the time any assignment were to be effected that Enron may already be at the limit of its overall exposure with those counter parties It cant be in a position where such an assignment could cause it to violate those limits we included an outside date by which Enron must decide whether or not to go forward of the first to occur of September or seven days after the Bonds are issued You had indicated that CDWR might be willing to consider such an outside date as long as i the MWh pricing was in effect from April and Enron had to act very shortly after the Bonds are issued We have proposed days for this in concept we probably will be ok with the alternative of securing a credit rating for the Fund as opposed to the Bonds although we have referred that question to the credit people to make sure in light of your response about opinions not being provided by outside counsel we modified the confirmation to request that the opinions could be from the AG or if CDWR cannot do that then from the GC of CDWR We felt that this would not involve additional work since these presumably will be rendered in connection with the Bonds and we provided that they generally would be provided to us after the Bonds are issued I think the foregoing represent most of the items we had discussed Please let me know when you wish to discuss Also it may make sense for our next call to have the respective Enron and CDWR commercial folks on the call since it may be the case that many of the final decisions involved may be commercial ones Lastly please note that while we have discussed most of the points addressed in the revised drafts with Enron in order to expedite the process we are sending these drafts simultaneously to you and Enron Thus it is possible that Enron may have further modifications or changes to the documents Thanks We look forward to working with you to finalize the requisite documents John This email including attachments contains

will introduce a bill today that will make it a felony for any energy supplier in California to engage in a conspiracy to drive up prices or manipulate the market The bill would apply to any company selling gas or electricity into the state or to any of the states utilities said a spokesman for Cardoza Under terms of the proposed legislation offenders would be subject to Californias three strikes law which sentences convicted felons to jail for life after three offenses Directors officers or any other employees associated with market manipulation of a company would be subject to this bill the spokesman said Cardoza will introduce the bill at a press conference today at pm Pacific time CD No easy solutions to crisis The crisis in California is far beyond shortterm fixes parading as potential solutions and there is no turning back for deregulation in the state according to a report released yesterday by consulting firm Andersen California has no choice but to forge ahead in repairing the damage that illplanned deregulation measures have caused the Energy Crisis in the Western US Lessons for navigating regulatory and market minefields report says Theres a common wisdom that knows you cant unscramble the egg said Matt Smith head of Andersens North American energy consulting practice All that can be done is correct the mistakes he added In addition steps must be implemented to prevent the spread of the California virus to other states electricity marketplaces Smith said To begin in our view the energy crisis in the western US has produced formidable challenges for utility industry regulators state and federal policymakers and industry executives Smith said The virus spawned in California requires new strategies to contain and reverse the damage The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far beyond the western United States Unfortunately California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis The proposed solutions put in motion by federal and state regulators as well as California policymakers have only led to an increasingly uncertain market and tension among those working for a viable resolution the report says In reaction to the breakdown many of Californias political leaders now prefer to abandon deregulation the report says The report concludes that power shortages and blackouts are inevitable this summer The deregulated marketplace which took a year to throw off track will more than likely take a number of years to put right the report says MCM Competing evidence clouds Calif investigation Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission the California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the states current energy crisis In the efforts to find a smoking gun legislators have leane d heavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group a consultancy commissioned by utility Southern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse But the states biggest transporter of gas to California El Paso Natu ral Gas is not ready to take the rap The pipeline has commissioned its own study which i t recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation As reported in both the trade press and national media SoCal Ed and the CP UC are pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde r prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding And exhibit A in their case against El Paso is The Brattle Groups study of the California market Richard Zeiger a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg chairman of the California Assembly Judiciary Committee told Gas Daily that The Brattle Groups market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not caused by normal market forces GD His remarks followed an oversight hearing during which Assembly members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in the California market El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly In a repor t presented to legislators a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence of factors not a conspiracy caused the price runup Lukens Consulting Group a Houstonbased consultancy was retained by El Pa so to conduct work on several fronts In its study of the California market Lukens concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the main culprits in the California gas price imbroglio Assemblyman John Campbell a Republican member of the oversight committee said he didnt see any smoking gun in either report We had our committee hearing and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle Study and a little on the Lukens study To some degree Im not sure that the California legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies Campbell said I believe FERC is looking at this situation and it would seem to me that thats the appropriate place Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines Its being pushed basically by the Public Utilities Commission here which believes that there was collusion by pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California he said The CPUC Campbell suggested sought satisfaction before the California assembly when it had failed on the federal level Theres a concerted effort not jus t on natural gas but on other things here in California for entities and organizations here to point the finger elsewhere for the problems that were having in this state and I think youre seein g some of that with the public utilities commission Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas prices is a different matter entirely In the meanwhile the dueling California market studies se em to have taken on a life of their own The Brattle Group Study for instance has become the center of a heavily litigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market participants Following on a request by SoCal Ed which said it needed additional data to round out The Brattle Group report FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading Several parties resisted FERCs call for market information saying the requested data contained commercially sensitive information FERC allowed the discovery process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting access to evidence GD Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their case The commission recently dismissed the CPUCs claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy In addressing the California Assembly representatives of Dynegy said that FERCs recent ruling on th e California border controversy obviated the need for more investigation The controversy however is far from over FERC last month also ordered a hearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv e up the price of gas delivered into California GD That hearing is likely to take place this summer RP et al NH

CT Dale CT cc Subject California Energy UpdateFYI Forwarded by Sheila TweedHOUECT on AM AM To cc Subject California Energy Update Members of the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Subcommittee opened hearings today on the Memorandum of Understanding MOU between Southern California Edison Company SCE Edison International EIX and the California Department of Water and Power CDWR Testifying on behalf of SCE were SCE Vice President Bob Foster and Ann Cohen Additional hearings will be scheduled next week at which time the subcommittee will hear from representatives of the Governor the Attorney General and CDWR Among other things committee members questioned the wisdom of acquiring the transmission system particularly on an as is basis the price to be paid alternative structures that would not require an acquisition by the state and the rate of return on new investment in the utility Also in Sacramento the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market is scheduled to continue its investigation Thursday on market manipulation Governor Davis representatives have been negotiating a transaction with Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co to buy the utilitys transmission assets The Governors representatives expect to have an agreement within one to two weeks Also today Governor Davis announced the appointment of Richard Sklar to head a team that will speed the construction of power plants in the state The Governors Generation Implementation Taskforce will work to bring electrical generation facilities on line by coordinating state permitting siting finance design and construction efforts in a one stop shop At its open meeting this evening the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC approved an order addressing market monitoring and mitigation for California wholesale power markets Based on the FERC staff presentation and discussion during the meeting it appears that the market monitoring and mitigation plan for California includes the following a requirement that all generators which entered into a Participating Generator Agreement with the ISO and all nonpublic utilities in California that sell into the ISOs realtime market or use the ISO transmission grid must offer all available electric capacity during all hours to the ISO realtime market except for hydroelectric units all public utility load serving entities in California must submit demand bids in realtime markets during all hours all sales by market participants that have been granted authority by the FERC to sell power at marketbased rates are subject to a refund condition to prevent anticompetitive bids into real time markets the ISO is required to submit weekly reports to the FERC on scheduled outages and bid data to facilitate market monitoring all sales into the ISO realtime market during a period of reserve deficiency ie during Stage or emergencies will be subject to price mitigation The FERC order will include a formula that the ISO will be required to apply for purposes of calculating a proxy price for all such sales The order will also enhance the ISOs ability to coordinate and control planned outages The mitigation plan will be in effect for a oneyear period and will be subject to periodic review The FERC is also requiring the ISO and the investorowned utilities to submit a filing by June to form a Regional Transmission Organization RTO If an RTO filing is not submitted by that date then the market monitoring and mitigation plan will terminate automatically The FERC is also directing the parties to work with RTO West an RTO approved for the Pacific Northwest to develop a plan for including California within RTO West with a goal of ultimately creating one RTO for the entire western interconnection Finally the FERC is instituting an investigation under Section of the Federal Power Act with respect to wholesale power sales throughout the western interconnection Apparently potential refund liability would apply to wholesale power sale transactions in the western interconnection entered into for a period of hours or less and made when reserve deficiencies are or less FERC also approved the formation of RTO West an eightstate RTO combining the transmission assets of nine utilities in the Pacific Northwest The FERC asked the RTO to make a submission to it by December of this year on its plans for including Canadian transmission and widening the scope of its operations in a broader regional system RTO West first submitted its plans to the FERC last October It includes nine electric utilities serving eight western states with some miles of transmission lines The nine utilities include Avista BPA Idaho Power Montana Power Nevada Power PacifiCorp Portland General Electric Puget Sound Energy and Sierra Pacific The states where the RTO West would operate are Washington Oregon Idaho Nevada Utah and parts of Montana Wyoming and California A more detailed

<1989356.1075853412166.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,elizabeth.sager@enron.com,2001-04-30 05:13:00,Re PGE and Enron StandStill Agreement Cc In accordance with our conversation late last week I am enclosing a revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was discussed on Wednesday My comments primarily involve the following As you and I discussed last week I thought it made sense to specify a reasonable date by which Enron and PGE shall have reached closure on a settlement agreement on the contract termination and related claims I proposed a one month period to do that If the parties cant come to an agreement in that time period then the mechanics in the MPA for re solving a dispute dealing with the calculation of the termination payment would be reactivated Obviously if we are making progress the parties can always extend the date I felt it was appropriate to specify the window period to make sure that everyone is focused on attempting to get a prompt resolution Assuming a final settlement agreement is agreed upon the conditions of the extension of the stay would be embodied in the settlement agreement itself as opposed to this letter Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in place while t he parties were working to see if a settlement agreement could be reached and that requirement is reflected in our revisions to the letter Thus the revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the Initial Extensi on Period ie to May Your draft had provided that Enron wou ld be required to keep the LCs in place even if no settlement agreement were to b e reached My view is that any requirement to maintain the LCs beyond the Initial Extension Period and any conditions with respect thereto if agreed to by Enron should be part of the final settlement agreement executed by t he parties rather than as part of this letter Also we note that as a contractual matter the MPA does not require the nondefaulting party to ke ep in place any security in favor of the defaulting party when as a result of a termination the nondefaulting party owes a payment to the defaulting part y See Sec Your draft of the letter provided that Enron agrees to enter in to new master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on commercially reasonable terms The revised letter specifies that Enron agrees to negotiate with PGE in these respects simultaneously with the negotiations towards a settlement agreement but any commitment on Enrons part to ef fect a contract or transaction with PGE will only arise as a result of the parties execution of the definitive transaction documents as opposed t o this letter the execution of which shall be in the sole discretion of eac h of the parties Please call me at your convenience to discuss any questions on the foregoin g or on the revised letter Thanks in advance for your help in moving this forward Elizabeth Sager Witalis Lawrence Law PM To cc Kuga Roy Wan Fong Corp Sena David Foley Jack Pearce Karola Law Harvey Kent BarLev Joshua Law Subject StandStill Agreement Ms Sager Attached is my draft of an agreement memorializing the parties respective commitments as we negotiate the amount of the Termination Payment and of other claims Enron may have against PGE in Bankruptcy Court I do not hav e your mailing address yet PGE would like to receive assurance soon that Enron agrees with the terms of this proposed letter agreement After reviewing the draft please indicate Enrons agreement by return email to me Or please call me to discuss Thanks Larry Witalis enrondocrtf enrondocrtf

Original Message From ROBERT ANDERSON ENRON mailtoIMCEA NOTESROBERTANDERSONCrobertEandersonblakesEcomEEN NRONcom SentWednesday August PM ToKeohane Peter SubjectSetOff Language Further to our conversations yesterday and today I attach the following Memorandum of Square SetOff Combinations Memorandum of Triangular SetOff Combinations Mandatory SetOff Language for EWS Trading Contracts Revision bl acklined to the version forwarded by Mark Haedicke Clean copy of attachment Revised Triangular Set Off Provisions and Square SetOff Provision This is a very interesting although somewhat complex assignment At your r equest I have reviewed the draft Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts as well as the setoff language in the draft Master Netting SetO ff and Security Agreement with a view to developing terms of setoff that w ill be enforceable in Canada For the moment I have considered the laws applicable in Alberta and have received input from my Ontario partner Kevi n McElcheran Unlike certain jurisdictions including for example Great Britain in Ca nada a creditors setoff rights are generally preserved in an insolvency Section of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act RSC c B a s amended and section of the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act SC c C as amended both expressly reserve application of the law of setoff in the context of an insolvency to which those acts apply Contra ctual setoff provisions are ordinarily enforceable in an insolvency provid ed the contract of which the setoff provision is part is itself enforceabl e ie has all of the elements of an enforceable contract including privit y and consideration Setoff is a powerful tool in insolvency because it permits a creditor with an otherwise unsecured claim to effectively satisfy that claim on a dollar fordollar basis out of amounts the creditor in turn owes to the insolvent company This is done at the expense of other unsecured creditors who wou ld otherwise receive the benefit of the debt owed by the settingoff credit or to the insolvent company The essence of setoff is mutuality the settingoff of a claim and crossc laim between the same parties The difficulty with the expansive setoff t erms sought by Enron is that they would permit setoff as between Enron a nd its counterparty of debts owed by or to a third party My concern is th at such purported setoff is so different in substance from the common no tion of setoff which requires mutuality as to be setoff in name only W ithout mutuality I am concerned that a court may not recognize such seto ff of obligations relating to third parties as setoff within the meanin g of Canadian insolvency legislation The concern is not only that a court may be reticent to allow receivables owed by third parties to the insolven t state to be used to satisfy the insolvent estates indebtedness to a cred itor The court may be view any contractual arrangement that baldly purpor ts to do that as something other than setoff known under the laws of Canad a I am not however aware of any case law on point With a view to solving the perceived problem with lack of mutuality I have incorporated language referred to in the materials as an aggregate liabi lity clause to try and ensure that in each instance the claim and crossc laim will be between the same parties The first two attachments analyse the various combinations involved in squa re and triangular setoff These memoranda serve as a check list to ensure that the proposed language will cover every possible combination of claim and crossclaim Turning now to the Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts att achment I have the following comments I have included wording to clarify that the option to setoff is to b e exercised jointly by X and its affiliates The reason for this is to avo id the uncertainty associated with multiple parties having the ability to e xercise inconsistent setoff options We must assume that this setoff pro vision will be included in separate contracts between a counterparty and va rious Enron affiliates If the counterparty defaults on more than one of t hese contracts or if they contain crossdefault provisions the Enron af filiate that is a party to each separate contract would be X under that c ontract and would have the option to exercise the setoff rights thereunder including the right to setoff against amounts it owes amounts that are o wed to any of its affiliates Those affiliates may each in turn be X und er their respective contracts and similarly entitled to exercise setoff ri ghts While it is unlikely that Enron and its affiliates would act inconsi stently in exercising setoff rights making it clear that the option to se toff must be exercised jointly by X and its affiliates minimizes any atta ck of the setoff provision on the basis of uncertainty associated with the potential for inconsistent exercise of the option to setoff With respect to the requirement that the setoff contract must have con sideration I have included an acknowledgement by the parties including af filiates that each has received valuable consideration for the covenants i nvolved This provision is not a complete answer to the requirement of con sideration but is helpful Paragraph B is included to address the mutuality requirement by inclu ding an aggregate liability clause as discussed above In the second paragraph of Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Co ntracts the changes to the sentence including limitation to have been ma de to clarify that the setoff provision is without limitation to any other rights which X or its affiliates may have I was concerned that the with out prejudice language in the prior draft would leave it open to the defa ulting party to argue that the setoff provision cannot work to its prejudi ce The balance of the revisions are simply drafting changes made in an att empt to improve the clarity and certainty of the terms involved In attach ment I have attempted to minimize the changes with the result that it is not as clear and certain as it might be I have also attached a revised tr iangular setoff provision attachment which is clearer more certain an d about one page longer Finally I have included a square setoff provision attachment which af fords Enron and any nondefaulting counterparty even better setoff prote ction As discussed I will include this provision in the Master Netting Setoff and Security Agreement form I would be pleased to discuss the attachments with you at your convenience Best Regards A Robert

Transactions The parties further ackno wledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as princip al and with respect to this Section as agent on behalf of its Affilia tes which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section and oth erwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to Section B Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agre ement the NonDefaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Default ing Party any amount under Section until the NonDefaulting Party receiv es confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion which may include an opinion of its counsel that all other obligations of any kind w hatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the NonDefaultin g Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other ag reements instruments or undertakings which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts du e and owing as of the Early Termination Date but does not include future p ayments between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates triangular se toff after the designation of an Early Termination Date This language ha s been reviewed by US bankruptcy counsel and is appropriate under US l aws for commodity transactions with USbased counterparties Each group will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdic tion in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability In addition prior to introducing this language into your forms changes will be require d to terminology andor to include terminations resulting from events other than Events of Default eg Affected Party under ISDA Finally when incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms please be aw are that this language is not intended to override the payment netting term s monthly netting of receivables or the closeout netting procedures app licable upon the designation of an Event of Default both of which should remain in the trading forms Rather this language is only intended to add setoff rights to all EWS trading forms When incorporating this setoff la nguage into your trading forms you will need to review the forms to determ ine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that wi ll need to be overridden andor coordinated Finally in order to assist a ll lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions we are in the process of preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutua lly beneficial to EWS and our counterparties which explanation you will be able to share with your counterparties This explanation will be distribut ed shortly If you have any questions please contact me at or Elizabet h Sager at

Nicolay Christi CcKean Steven Shapiro Richard Robertson Linda Novosel Sarah Wha lley Greg Lavorato John Forster David Bradford William S Steffes James Sager Elizabeth Hodge Jeffrey T Haedicke Mark E Taylor Mark Briggs Tom Long Chris Butts Bob Zipper Andy SubjectRe Draft Responses to FERC Staff QuestionIn providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessm ent or management would you please provide an explanation to the following We understand that EOL requires that a counter party before accessing E OL to do business with Enron North America must undergo a credit worthines s evaluation When a counter party executes or clicks on a price EOL doe s an instant credit check before confirming the transaction However Enron may not only buy from a counter party it may sell What so rt of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party util izing EOL to purchase from Enron Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter p arty credit risk that Enron uses If yes may we have copies If Enron ut ilizes its own agreements please provide us with a copy All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any trans action being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being conduct ed over the phone or through EnronOnline Enron as the principal to all p urchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on the t elephone or in writing requires counterparties to be creditworthy In add ition Enrons risk management process is required to be approved by the En ron Board of Directors according to Securities Exchange Act regulations as a publicly held company Enrons risk policies are provided in Enrons pu blicly available Q audited financial statements filed on a quarterly and annual basis with the SEC Enron maintains a separate risk m anagement group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the C hairman of Enron Corp and has the authority to instruct the suspension of transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded In a ddition every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before the y can transact through EnronOnline The Credit Risk Management group appro ves a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are em bedded within the EnronOnline database Every transaction is passed thro ugh an electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor l imits are not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterpartys bid or o ffer via EnronOnline such credit checks are done automatically and there i s no human intervention As with all Enron transactions the credit limit checks utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future price volatility The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction f low on all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually EnronOnl ine does provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit limits or breach credit limits No further transactions are executed unles s CRM is sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated such that credit limit is still available EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters into whether we are buying or selling The transactions entered into on E nronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General Ter ms and Conditions which are a shorter form of contract and differ for each commodity these are all available on the website A Master Agreement i s negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilatera l credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on Enro nOnline The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to EnronOnline transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between Enron and the counterparty include industry standard credit requirements which the count erparty chooses to accept or not online should the counterparty not want t o accept to language in the contract for credit or other reasons the Hel pdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact between the Enron Credit grou p or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing the Counterparty to n egotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them Question I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect data regarding where a customers mouse is moving on the system However does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled If yes does EOL col lect use or manage data regarding cookies It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customers mouse is moving on the system It is also correct to note that we have no capability of knowing where the customers mouse is EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled Question Also why doesnt EOL publish a ticker of completed trades showing prices and quantities Does EOL have any plans to start publishing such data If yes when There are now several options for viewing historical pricingtransaction da ta from EnronOnline Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnlin e enrononlinequotes which also provides custom ers with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which they acquire access In addition EnronOnline provides a number of online charts for products which graphically depict historical transaction prices Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and downloa d the results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline The system also all ows for administrative users thereby allowing the back offices of counterp arties to monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in li ne with their own systems Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market ac tivity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices For e xample Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian En erdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place this will commen ce on July At the end of each day EnronOnline makes available t o all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price of that day s transactions The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent in this fo rmat to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index Question In addition how does the data collection from EOLEnron Net works flow to the risk management groups How is the information used EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups depen ding on the type of commodity transacted For example the group that hand les US gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling Australi an Power The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back office utilizing a bridge a process that is capable of communicating transacti on information into the variety of systems that Enron operates The potenti al for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the custom er with more efficient recording of the transaction The back office system s at Enron use transaction information as an input into various functions such as invoicing preparation of financial statements risk management and credit These back office systems are used to track transactions from all sources including EnronOnline the telephone other trading systems etc Information is maintained on these systems according to accounting and re gulatory rules regardless of the source of the transaction The Enron commercial employee who is offering to buy or to sell through En ronOnline does so through a price management software application this no tifies him immediately that a transaction is completed The counterparty the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notifi ed by the system at the same time The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as information is used from any transaction completed by Enron When a transa ction is completed EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture system that captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system Enron Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems It does howeve r automate our deal capture system which improves the data feeds to our s ettlement and credit systems Question Also we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained by EOL If yes in what form and for how long EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database The tra nsactions are bridged duplicated onto the various systems databases m anaging the underlying commodity the risk system associated with the commo dity We currently intend to store the data for a period of six years pos t a transaction completing for example deliveries finishing and this is policy across all databases In general EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free realtime pricing information for approximately products for comm odities including electricity and natural gas EnronOnline utilizes ecom merce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that previously t ook place on the telephone and by fax EnronOnline is a proprietary or onetomany trading platform On a onetomany platform one entity suc h as Enron is the principal to every trade unlike a broker type platfor m EnronOnline allows buyers and sellers to act on prices that can change by t he second Buyers or sellers can also see realtime price spreads of both the sell price and the buy price For example on the telephone a buyer p reviously would call to ask about gas prices for each of the next six month s but by the time the trader finished reciting the prices some prices cou ld have changed EnronOnline allows counterparties to see the bid and off er prices all the time to make more informed decisions The energy products offered on EnronOnline are subject to federal oversight as follows The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC has enforc ement authority over physical transactions on EnronOnline to police for pot ential manipulation The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has regulato ry authority over physical natural gas and electricity sales for resale The CFTC has antifraud and antimanipulation enforcement jurisdiction over financially settled derivatives swaps and options Moreover pursuant t o the Commodity Exchange Act CEA Enron can only trade derivatives with counterparties that qualify as sophisticated according to such rules Suc h transactions are permitted as long as both parties are Eligible Contract Participants ECPsgenerally corporations partnerships and other entit ies that meet net worth or asset tests EnronOnline is a proprietary bilateral trading platform on which Enron is a principal to every trade As such EnronOnline is not a trading facilit y as defined under the CFMA As a proprietary platform EnronOnline uses

tip Look at Californias spin on contract provisions preventing California from seeking FERC review of contract prices California officials now argue that such provisions indicate that suppliers had undue bargaining power Rather than protecting suppliers these provisions are having the opposite effect of drawing political and legal scrutinysch THE STATE Energy Pacts Bar State From Seeking US Review of Prices Crisis The provisions suggest the amount of clout generators had during negotiations Consumer advocates want the agreements redone By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITERS October SACRAMENTO Buried in the fine print of the longterm contracts California officials signed to buy billions of dollars in electricity are provisions giving up the states right to seek a federal examination of whether the contract prices are unreasonably high Critics of the contracts call those clauses the clearest evidence yet that many of the agreements need to be renegotiated You would never find a provision like that in a contract that was negotiated under normal circumstances because its patently ridiculous said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey It demonstrates how much clout the generators had in negotiating these contracts The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is obligated to ensure that wholesale power prices are just and reasonable If the FERC finds otherwise it has the authority to order power sellers to refund profits In recent weeks Loretta Lynch president of the state Public Utilities Commission has asked the FERC to review two of the states longterm power contracts The prices and terms of those contracts may be unjust and unreasonable Lynch said Neither contract had the nochallenge clause But when asked about contracts that include the prohibition Lynch expressed outrage They didnt want anybody looking over their shoulder she said From my perspective that contractual provision is great evidence that the generators knew they were sticking up the state If they thought this was a reasonable contract why wouldnt they want FERC to uphold their deal States Bargaining Position Was Weak The companies with nochallenge clauses in their contracts included Mirant Americas Energy Marketing Dynegy Power Marketing Sempra Energy Resources Allegheny Energy Supply Co Coral Power and Williams Energy Marketing Trading S David Freeman the states chief negotiator on longterm power contracts who was recently named head of the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority said the clause needed to be understood in the context of the energy crisis At the time the contracts were negotiated the states two largest utilities Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison had already failed to pay energy companies hundreds of millions of dollars for power purchases Our reputation as a state for sticking by what we said and having credit was not all that great in January he said They were asking Is this a serious deal Is the state of California committed to it What are you going to sayno Then youre not going to get a deal The state began a hurried effort to negotiate longterm contracts in January after energy prices on the spot market spiraled to unprecedented heights The costs threatened to bankrupt the states utilities which were unable to buy power on their own for their customers State officials negotiated dozens of contracts some lasting as long as years which offered prices ranging from to per megawatthoura far cry from the per megawatthour the state was frequently paying on the spot market at the time But by summer the wild energy market stabilized and prices dropped California suddenly found itself paying more under the longterm contracts than the to per megawatthour offered on the spot market Look at the context in which the state was entering into these contracts They were pretty much desperate said Mike Florio senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco We were talking about windfall profits taxes and seizing power plants and I think the generators started putting in their contracts anything they could think of to keep the state from undoing the deal once things calmed down which they have Michael J Niggli president of Sempra Energy Resources said the clauses provided the kind of reassurance that allows the financial community to say were willing to invest in California Its not that were superseding anything frankly its that weve said we dont want the party weve done the transaction with to try to derail it Niggli said He acknowledged that the contract clause cannot prevent the state from asking for federal review The question becomes Will FERC accept that or consider that he said And then Do we consider that a breach of the contract in any way shape or form Bowen and Freeman predicted that the clauses would not stand up to court scrutiny Frankly I wasnt too concerned about the clause Freeman said I dont think its enforceable Enforceable or not Bowen said the clauses would complicate any state efforts to seek FERC review The very fact that they were able to get that kind of language in the contracts tells you it wasnt an evenhanded situation she said I believe the state in negotiating the contracts did the best possible job it could under the circumstances but that doesnt excuse officials from the responsibility of trying to improve the situation now For information about reprinting this article go to rightsregisterhtm

Bryson Jesse Sent Monday September PM To Hall Steve C Legal Foster Chris H Subject FERC Judge Rejects Claims For Elec Refunds In Pacific NW FERC Judge Rejects Claims For Elec Refunds In Pacific NW Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Dow Jones The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shouldnt order refunds for power sales in the Pacific Northwest a FERC administrative law judge told the commission Monday I recommend that the commission not order refunds in this case because the prices werent unreasonable and unlike California the market is a competitive market concluded Carmen Cintron the FERC judge presiding over the case The spiraling prices in Californias dysfunctional power market were only one of many factors contributing to the regions high electricity prices which were primarily the result of a supply shortage as the hydropowerdependent region experienced a drought the judge said Spot market bilateral sales constituted only a small percentage of the total volume of transactions in the region because forward contracts are heavily relied on Cintron said Overruling the finding of FERC trial staff Cintron found there was no evidence that sellers exercised market power in the region The prices were agreed to by willing buyers and sellers the judge said The judge urged FERC to grant a motion by Puget Energy Inc PSD and dismiss the case At issue were refund claims totaling more than billion with threequarters of that amount claimed by California on behalf of the states Department of Water Resources for purchases in the refund period of Dec to June In July FERC set the case for an expedited hearing before Cintron after separating the Pacific Northwest claims from a larger refund proceeding involving power sales in California from Oct through June The administrative law judge is scheduled to forward an initial decision to the commission in the California refund case in December Unlike California the Northwest had a vibrant and functional competitive market and ordering refunds for the minority of those in the proceeding making claims would have detrimental effects on the market Cintron told the commission Evidence of record indicates that refunds would have a negative impact to the Pacific Northwest market Cintron concluded This business relies on finality of deals and reliance on your trading partner Balancing the shortterm benefit of refunds to a few market participants against the immediate and longterm damage to the market and to future investment decisions it is impossible to reconcile refunds with the overall publicinterest standard Cintron said California sought billion of the nearly billion in total claims The remainder was claimed by municipally owned utilities in Seattle million Tacoma Wash million Clark Wash million Eugene Ore million Sacramento Calif million and Northern Wasco County Ore million Also the Port of Seattle sought million in refunds Cintron was persuaded by the ripple claims arguments of the majority opposing refunds They argued that awarding the claims of the few seeking refunds would destabilize the overall market since most sellers themselves would then stake claims for refunds Unraveling these transactions is to be mildly stated a complex task Cintron said The immense number of potential ripple claims is directly related to the highly active nature of the Pacific Northwest wholesale electricity market the judge said Given the sheer magnitude of contracts that would have to be rewritten as a result of ordering refunds it would be impossible to unwind the chain of transactions that resulted in a single bilateral sale she said The commission may either accept or reject Cintrons recommendations which were intended to form the basis for whether FERC should order a more expansive hearing to determine refund amounts owed In the event FERC does move to order refunds Cintron offered her conclusions on what constitutes a spotmarket sale in the regions bilateral contracts market While power marketers had argued for a strict definition sales of no more than hours duration those seeking refunds had argued that refunds should apply to sales for periods

I wish you all the best Have a good week Bridget I thought this was a very thoughtprovoking piece Anjali The following was sent to me by my friend Tamim Ansary Tamim is an AfghaniAmerican writer He is also one of the most brilliant people I know in this life When he writes I read When he talks I listen Here is his take on Afghanistan and the whole mess we are in Gary T Ive been hearing a lot of talk about bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Ronn Owens on KGO Talk Radio today allowed that this would mean killing innocent people people who had nothing to do with this atrocity but were at war we have to accept collateral damage What else can we do Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether we have the belly to do what must be done And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am from Afghanistan and even though Ive lived here for years Ive never lost track of whats going on there So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where Im standing I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in New York I agree that something must be done about those monsters But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan Theyre not even the government of Afghanistan The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan When you think Taliban think Nazis When you think Bin Laden think Hitler And when you think the people of Afghanistan think the Jews in the concentration camps Its not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity They were the first victims of the perpetrators They would exult if someone would come in there take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country Some say why dont the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban The answer is theyre starved exhausted hurt incapacitated suffering A few years ago the United Nations estimated that there are disabled orphans in Afghanistana country with no economy no food There are millions of widows And the Taliban has been burying these widows alive in mass graves The soil is littered with land mines the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets These are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Trouble is thats been done The Soviets took care of it already Make the Afghans suffer Theyre already suffering Level their houses Done Turn their schools into piles of rubble Done Eradicate their hospitals Done Destroy their infrastructure Cut them off from medicine and health care Too late Someone already did all that New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs Would they at least get the Taliban Not likely In todays Afghanistan only the Taliban eat only they have the means to move around Theyd slip away and hide Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans they dont move too fast they dont even have wheelchairs But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldnt really be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific thing Actually it would only be making common cause with the Talibanby raping once again the people theyve been raping all this time So what else is there What can be done then Let me now speak with true fear and trembling The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops When people speak of having the belly to do what needs to be done theyre thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent people Lets pull our heads out of the sand Whats actually on the table is Americans dying And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Ladens hideout Its much bigger than that folks Because to get any troops to Afghanistan wed have to go through Pakistan Would they let us Not likely The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first Will other Muslim nations just stand by You see where Im going Were flirting with a world war between Islam and the West And guess what thats Bin Ladens program Thats exactly what he wants Thats why he did this Read his speeches and statements Its all right there He really believes Islam would beat the west It might seem ridiculous but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the West hes got a billion soldiers If the west wreaks a holocaust in those lands thats a billion people with nothing left to lose thats even better from Bin Ladens point of view Hes probably wrong in the end the west would win whatever that would mean but the war would last for years and millions would die not just theirs but ours Who has the belly for that Bin Laden does Anyone else Tamim Ansary Descargue GRATUITAMENTE MSN Explorer en intlasp

animosity towards Enron and marketers seems only to be increasing I like the proposal to merge the discussions but You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked Mike Small if he wouldnt consider merging the discussions contracting groups After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer Sharis name came up a lot he said he did not think it would ever work Im all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members drafting committee and all would relish it as well What do you think is the next best step ps the meeting in San Diego on the st is still unclear for Houston based Enron employees Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly We are trying to get Mike to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK Lets talk about this also Hoping not to stay the course again Talk to you soon Elizabeth Sager Original Message From Hall Steve C Legal Sent Wednesday October AM To Yoder Christian Sager Elizabeth Subject Faithbased contracting I agree with Christian that we cannot win over the WSPP folks simply by telling them that their contract is not as good as ours Everytime I venture out to the larger NW community of IOUs munis and federal PMAs I realize that the WSPP is more than a contract its almost a religion One cannot convince a Muslim that the Bible is better written than the Koran Whether its assimilation or merger or the hint that the WSPP might be destined for a larger role in advocacy and education we need to give Mike Small a facesaving way of relinquishing the WSPP contract Modifying the WSPP to look like the EEI only strengthens the resolve of WSPPers to stick with the original contractWhy should I change the agreements are virtually identical Original Message From Yoder Christian Sent Wednesday October AM To Sager Elizabeth Cc Hall Steve C Legal Subject FW Legal Discussion Elizabeth I am going to divide my presentation into two parts One is going to be designed to give the marketers talking points and the other is going to be a technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of scary war stories I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron policy on WSPP approach Unless you agree with and support this kind of How Enron views the WSPP policy I shouldnt be advocating it at the meeting Enrons view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI should be coming to an end It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI experts to merge the agreements Everybody is wasting too much time comparing the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other Every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements one that is almost like the other one Valuable resource time is being wasted Enron believes that a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best provide an extremely useful industry formum kind of function The WSPP should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for RTO West dealing with the emerging California changes and open access in Oregon and Nevada Right now the highly talented regional organization is spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center This unfortunate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions The WSPP organization is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ever narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because our marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondoggles Sales people do not want to feel alone and different They are all about the slimy intimacy of sales It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cour dLane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult questions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such He wants to feel loved Therefore this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP for being a great organization but at the same time advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects Rosman should say Enron loves the WSPP it has done a great job with the contract reformation that task is done we now should move on to bigger and better tasks Lets get the contract stuff wrapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agenda Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess Otherwise we pit Enrons clearmindedness against a stubborn mass of inert resistance and much toxic upheaval is the only result The world including our little western power world is not made up of people sitting around trying to be rational It is full of all of the conflicts of history ambitious tirades irrational idiocyncracies and strong personalities The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon They are not going to go away Enron needs to be more subtle in its regional diplomacy Praise them as we bury them on the contract front As our headquarters commander I beg you to let Steve and me as field operatives pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months We can wind these guys up to talk this kind of talk next Wednesday One consequence of the policy is that you would have to urge the EEI bureacracy to embrace a joint committee approach cgy Original Message From Rosman Stewart Sent Friday October PM To Choi Paul Malowney John Van Gelder John Lackey Chris Buerkle Jim Cc Belden Tim Calger Christopher F Yoder

Copyright Houston Chronicle Proarena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday pitching the million plan to a grassroots group of Latino leaders More than community activists and leaders precinct judges and civicassociation members attended an informational meeting and getoutthevote rally for the Nov arena referendum The rally was sponsored by the Lets Build It Together political action committee By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this it empowers us said Celina GarzaRidge a Harris CountyHouston Sports Authority director Its very important to be able to say the Hispanic community made a difference and we are exactly in that position George Postolos the Houston Rockets chief operating officer said the team is actively courting the Hispanic community The proarena committee headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan and Ken Lay Enron chairman and chief executive officer does not want a repeat of the referendum Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal The sports authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and county to oversee and develop sports venues The Rockets made a percent participation commitment similar to the one made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field to fairly share the new arenas design and construction jobs with minorities and women The team also promised to distribute up to a year in neighborhood improvement grants of up to each to worthy grassroots nonprofit organizations and civic clubs in innercity Houston The new program targets the Hispanic community Postolos said The new arena plan is being endorsed by a crosssection of Latino leaders including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez state Rep Mario Gallegos the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city and the Hispanic community is getting more tangibles this time around He said When you consider that our community will get percent affirmative action that our youth will be taken care of through youth outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well this is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the Hispanic community Mercedes Alejandro who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston heard the details of the plan for the first time Its good if it creates jobs for the community and opportunities to rebuild the community she said We want it to be good for the whole not the few Humberto Barrera president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization was critical of Hispanic leaders not the arena plan I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay raises for teachers health care and public safety than building arenas for rich entrepreneurs Barrera said Richard Torres director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce told attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing Sergio Davila president of the Eastwood Civic Association brought up the lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the teams staff Postolos acknowledged that the team needs to do better TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost Mln By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow Jones The nations top two power providers are battling in a US court over an unexecuted power sales agreement The Tennessee Valley Authority TVA has filed a claim against the power marketing unit of Enron Corp ENE alleging breach of a power sales contract TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen expenses contributing to the governmentowned utilitys inability to meet its debtreduction forecast According to the documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires the alleged breach of contract contributed to a million shortfall during fiscal year TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case which is under a court protective order A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract said David Smith TVAs chief financial officer when asked Friday to elaborate on the line item in the information provided to TVAs distribution utility customers But after consulting with attorneys Smith revealed that Enron was the subject of the claim TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment order from the US District Court in Chattanooga Tenn in February stemming from a dispute over a longterm sales agreement an Enron spokesman said Monday In March TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of contract a TVA spokesman said Monday But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract or to elaborate further on the dispute citing the judges protective order TVA said Enron sought the court seal The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houstonbased energy giant and TVA a governmentowned utility that ranks among the largest US power producers The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to the lucrative US Midwest power market which saw extreme price spikes during hot weather in the summers of and After the summer of in which power that typically sells for between and per megawatthour spiked as high as per megawatthour Enron cited a study showing that TVAs power grid represented the only unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were spiking upward Enron built gasfired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access across TVAs system After the summer of saw a repeat in extreme price volatility Enron began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service requests A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement over the government utilitys handling of transmissionaccess requests But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public with its complaints about TVAs transmission service In February Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson asking for the governments help charging that TVA was unfairly giving its own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enrons requests were gathering dust Enron later dropped the matter saying that TVA was processing its transmission service requests on a timely basis By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

Dispute PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT DO NOT DISTRIBUTE Elizabeth I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY While I think we should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone I nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary focal points for those discussions particularly if you dont get to this for a few days I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some comments as I was thinking through some of the issuespositions Also Ill have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office but I thought I could generally review the PPA in any event In addition I did not know whether it was ENAs or Dynegys obligation to work on a response to CMS but I thought it made some sense to see what one might look like on paper See attached At this point however Im not sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contractbased rationale in writing to CMS as to MPLPs position that the capacity charges should be adjusted on a calendar year basis You will note that the draft letter focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract Capacity Factor which clearly is done on a calendar year basis rather than the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D As noted below there are some issues underlying this position Preliminary Overall Assessment The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year basiswhich generally supports MPLPs positionthe effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies namely the stated capacity charge on Exhibit D for Year only would apply for months but even more importantly the capacity charge on Exhibit D for Year would apply for the last months of the Contract Term The anomaly running in the other direction is that under CMSs interpretation various computations would be made on a calendar year basis eg Contract Capacity Factor and adjustments resulting therefrom would be applied midstream ie after months of the alleged contract year My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly described above that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year concept ie the month Year issue since that is a fairly easy concept to get your arms around More InformationDiligenceResearch Before a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made we likely would want to review or undertake as the case may be some additional informationdiligenceresearch such as which I assume we could generally obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the email you forwarded The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA prior to the first amendment in a published Order Was there anything in that Order or the submissions or exhibits thereto including financial projections that might provide some guidance My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance where the COD was not a Jan Do we or local counsel know whether this may be a global attack by CMS on these types of PPAs While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the excess capacity payments from its customersso that it presumably would have to issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims CMS self bills itself under the PPA Has the statute of limitations run on any of its claims for refunds for prior years Can CMSs prior course of dealing be used to support MPLPs contractual interpretation or is there otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior overpayments as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity payments This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis only The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC Isnt this determination to be made over the life of the PPA rather than for any particular period Assuming CMSs statement is correct I assume it does not affect the validity of the PPA but only whether CMS can recover the excess amount in rates Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the PUC If so can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall restructuring of the PPA Certain Points in Support of MPLPs Position The definition of Contract Capacity Factor provides for a calendar year determination and most importantly provides for a partial year calculation for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar year If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the COD date it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation Sec a provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity Factor is less than then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows The capacity charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined Emphasis added This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year not on the next anniversary of the COD It arguably would not appear to make any sense to apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis but determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not require an adjustment NOTE The counterargument however is that the foregoing language only pertains to the computation of a percentage haircut or adjustment that is applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D whatever those may be rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective That is making this adjustment on a calendar year basis even though the scheduled capacity rates change each October is not necessarily in conflict with the rest of the PPA Sec b Effective Date and Term provides that the Agreement runs for years and thereafter from year to year unless a party gives at least one years notice to terminate which termination shall be effective at the end of the years or any calendar year thereafter Emphasis added Thus for example if one month after the end of the year termie October a party gave notice to terminate such termination would be effective December not September or September ie not on the anniversary dates of the COD Thus the PPA contemplates in certain respects certain stub years and certain long years a contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLPs position on the stub and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D There are other calendar year based obligationsfor eg Sec and Exhibit B reflect termination payments that again are calculated on a calendar year basis We should discuss with the commercial people the economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be additional support in that respect Note that some other calendar year based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA but can still be used to reflect the underlying calendar year flavor of the PPA since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment A Few Additional Points to Note The PPA is devoid of default language LDs etc however MPLP could bring a claim against CMS to arbitration Sec for what it believes it is owed when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in plus interest as provided at Sec and keep performing under the PPA Although I do not see a significant issue here lets briefly discuss the potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an indication of a regulatory disallowance pursuant to Sec c as a way to attempt to force its contract year interpretation of Exhibit D While Sec c is one of those old school one way regulatory outs MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec e requiring CMS to defend the PPA to prevent CMSs affirmatively use of the PUC to support its contract claim In Pennsylvania PECO in an analogous circumstance attempted to use a PUC determination as justification to attempt to break a PPA with a QF Let me know when you wish to follow up John This email including attachments contains information

driveways use the second for easy unloading through back Our neighbors across the street are Barbara blonde sister and Pat brunette sister Dury Eric Rosen first driveway on left Stan Adele Seigel driveway to right feel absolutely free to call upon them if you feel the need Im sure Eric will stop by with his new puppy Clifford Karen and Jim Rauter live on the high road Lake Street extension they have a little boy Julian about Sams age Again please feel free to call them She is the one that has the interesting job with the not for profit environmental group Nearby Attractions Eric Rosens pondsee his garden too Walk down his driveway until you get to trailer garden on right veer off left past the trailer into brush and follow path through two fields and see pond on right Good Evening walk to see Great Blue Heron in pond His new house I helped design is on top of the hillAlso Walk up Elk creek Rdjust watch for fast traffic nice views walk through little abandoned cemetery across the Siegels driveway and walk up that hill and through the fields for nice vistas Definitely take a bike ride down high road all the way back to Johnson Farm In general we feel free to access the creeks through other peoples property especially if they are not in sight PS the wagon in the yard is how we get Lucy back to Erics until we go off the roadWe also left our hiking pack if Sam can be carried in it Swimming is available at the Pine Hill Lake Go back to Route and take left go over Pine Hill and see Lake on rightIt is a public facility with life guards and the beach looks a little fakey from the road but the swimming is reallywonderful with a floating dock There are some creek swimming holes but we dont really frequent any though if you see a bunch of cars along the road chances are thats one In the town of Fleischmanns there is a really nice park with a public swimming pool soccer field tennis courts basketball courts another good place to hang and play frisbee with the kids Other day excursions Little Pond and Big Pond Recreational areas or hike to Giant Ledge see Big Indian turnoff from Route and follow that road until you come to the first sharp right bend and see parking on right Ledge is about miles careful of the edge a beautiful vista and a not too strenuous hike You can find these places on the maps of the Park in the Plastic envelope inside the big cluttered mess of a cabinet in the Living Room This is our too busy to put away depository For food shopping you should make a pit stop in Boiceville Supermarket on the left of Route on the way to the house from the thruway it is the cheapest best selection and place to stock for the week If you arrive on a Sat in time to go to the Round barn Farmers Market near Roxbury on Route there are fresh produce and food stands and some times live music in a wonderful old round barn See attached maps Also go to Margaretville once you are at house for shopping wine store cheese store and an AP For a special meal stop at the seafood place on route in Arkville He goes to Maine every week for fresh lobster Check out the antiques center in the old theater in Margaretville for good browsing Other towns of interest and beautiful drives Andes has old hotel with restaurant and is very pretty also has good thrift shop Bovina is a beautiful little town with a good cafe style grocery run by relocated tasteful city folk good food Things about the house Unfortunately we have developed a knocking in our pipes in the bathroom dont be alarmed just adjust the controls to help get rid of it Also more importantly we donot use the water for cooking or drinking as it is hardnot so good tasting and has a high salt content We use the nearby spring to fill the jugs at the foot of the steps in the basement The Spring is located on the high road going back towards Fleischmanns you pass West Settlement where honey stand is go over little bridge then see meadow on left go past this meadow about yards until you see a stand of tall pine trees on left and there is a wide shoulder on the left side of the road look for the spring on the right side of the road across from the pine stand It is delicious water The house water is just fine for bathing and rinsing food Also make sure the shower curtains stay closed while you are showering as the water can escape out the back if you dont close them Another thing if there is alot of rain the water will get a brownish tint to it If it gets really bad and you dont want to use it to bathe you can go to the public showers at Pine Hill Lake or even ask Barbara across the street if you could borrow hers We have actually gotten an estimate to upgrade the whole system so if the guy calls while you are there tell him we will contact him when we return For clothes washing there is a Laundermat in Margaretville where you can play frisbee in the field behind the place or go fishing in the creek while you waitPS My rod is in the basement and the reel is on top of the Fridge Well I think thats the most of it Ill call you from Block Island with our number there In the case of Emergency call Eric or Barbara or our fire number is posted on the mailbox Eric Rosen works at the Cafe on Main Street in Margaretville in the evenings there is a hospital emergency room on route in Margatretville If you need to see a doctor for some reason call Karen to get the name of her pediatrician otherwise Dr Marguerite Collins may be able to help she has an excellent rep Have Fun and cant wait to see you

driveway to right feel absolutely free to call upon them if you feel the need Im sure Eric will stop by with his new puppy Clifford Karen and Jim Rauter live on the high road Lake Street extension they have a little boy Julian about Sams age Again please feel free to call them She is the one that has the interesting job with the not for profit environmental group Nearby Attractions Eric Rosens pondsee his garden too Walk down his driveway until you get to trailer garden on right veer off left past the trailer into brush and follow path through two fields and see pond on right Good Evening walk to see Great Blue Heron in pond His new house I helped design is on top of the hillAlso Walk up Elk creek Rdjust watch for fast traffic nice views walk through little abandoned cemetery across the Siegels driveway and walk up that hill and through the fields for nice vistas Definitely take a bike ride down high road all the way back to Johnson Farm In general we feel free to access the creeks through other peoples property especially if they are not in sight PS the wagon in the yard is how we get Lucy back to Erics until we go off the roadWe also left our hiking pack if Sam can be carried in it Swimming is available at the Pine Hill Lake Go back to Route and take left go over Pine Hill and see Lake on rightIt is a public facility with life guards and the beach looks a little fakey from the road but the swimming is reallywonderful with a floating dock There are some creek swimming holes but we dont really frequent any though if you see a bunch of cars along the road chances are thats one In the town of Fleischmanns there is a really nice park with a public swimming pool soccer field tennis courts basketball courts another good place to hang and play frisbee with the kids Other day excursions Little Pond and Big Pond Recreational areas or hike to Giant Ledge see Big Indian turnoff from Route and follow that road until you come to the first sharp right bend and see parking on right Ledge is about miles careful of the edge a beautiful vista and a not too strenuous hike You can find these places on the maps of the Park in the Plastic envelope inside the big cluttered mess of a cabinet in the Living Room This is our too busy to put away depository For food shopping you should make a pit stop in Boiceville Supermarket on the left of Route on the way to the house from the thruway it is the cheapest best selection and place to stock for the week If you arrive on a Sat in time to go to the Round barn Farmers Market near Roxbury on Route there are fresh produce and food stands and some times live music in a wonderful old round barn See attached maps Also go to Margaretville once you are at house for shopping wine store cheese store and an AP For a special meal stop at the seafood place on route in Arkville He goes to Maine every week for fresh lobster Check out the antiques center in the old theater in Margaretville for good browsing Other towns of interest and beautiful drives Andes has old hotel with restaurant and is very pretty also has good thrift shop Bovina is a beautiful little town with a good cafe style grocery run by relocated tasteful city folk good food Things about the house Unfortunately we have developed a knocking in our pipes in the bathroom dont be alarmed just adjust the controls to help get rid of it Also more importantly we donot use the water for cooking or drinking as it is hardnot so good tasting and has a high salt content We use the nearby spring to fill the jugs at the foot of the steps in the basement The Spring is located on the high road going back towards Fleischmanns you pass West Settlement where honey stand is go over little bridge then see meadow on left go past this meadow about yards until you see a stand of tall pine trees on left and there is a wide shoulder on the left side of the road look for the spring on the right side of the road across from the pine stand It is delicious water The house water is just fine for bathing and rinsing food Also make sure the shower curtains stay closed while you are showering as the water can escape out the back if you dont close them Another thing if there is alot of rain the water will get a brownish tint to it If it gets really bad and you dont want to use it to bathe you can go to the public showers at Pine Hill Lake or even ask Barbara across the street if you could borrow hers We have actually gotten an estimate to upgrade the whole system so if the guy calls while you are there tell him we will contact him when we return For clothes washing there is a Laundermat in Margaretville where you can play frisbee in the field behind the place or go fishing in the creek while you waitPS My rod is in the basement and the reel is on top of the Fridge Well I think thats the most of it Ill call you from Block Island with our number there In the case of Emergency call Eric or Barbara or our fire number is posted on the mailbox Eric Rosen works at the Cafe on Main Street in Margaretville in the evenings there is a hospital emergency room on route in Margatretville If you need to see a doctor for some reason call Karen to get the name of her pediatrician otherwise Dr Marguerite Collins may be able to help she has an excellent rep Have Fun and cant wait to see you

February PM To State Restructuring Service Members List Serve Cc Lawrence Logan Maria Veiga Subject State Restructuring CA PUC Adopts DWR Regulations ReRegulates Utility Generation California PUC Adopts DWR Regulations ReRegulates Utility Generation DWR power to go only to SCE and PGE customers for now Obligates SCE and PGE to make DWR whole for its unrecovered costs Reregulates all generation retained by the IOUs Each to file costbased rates Rate base to be net depreciated book value less recovered stranded costs The California PUC adopted emergency regulations for the delivery and payment mechanisms the states Department of Water Resources DWR will use in fulfilling its electric purchase and sale obligations under emergency bill AB X Under the provisions of AB X which the PUC apparently had confidence would be enacted without significant change the PUC requires the DWR to sell the power it purchases directly to the retail end use customers of Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas Electric PGE Since the law requires the PUC to ensure that DWR recovers all of the costs of its power purchase program and yet also limits the recovery to only an allocable portion of the utilities currently frozen energy charges the PUC recognizes the possibility that DWRs costs may not be fully recovered at certain times The PUC makes SCE and PGE liable to pay any shortfalls to ensure DWR recovers its costs on as current a basis as possible but suggests it is open to further consideration of this policy URG Assets ReRegulated The PUC orders the three utilities to each make Advice Letter filings to establish costbased rates for their URG The rate set will be made retroactive to whenever the utility stopped bidding its retained generation into to the PX which SCE and PGE said they stopped doing on The two utilities said they stopped participating in the PX dayof and dayahead markets on The PUC directs the utilities to calculate their cost of capitalrelated revenue requirements using the amounts in their respective Transition Cost Balancing Accounts TCBA as the rate base The TCBA reflects the net book value of utility generation assets less the recovery of those assets stranded costs The PUC will allow utilities to record in a memorandum account the difference between this reduced rate of return component of revenue requirements and their last PUC authorized rate of return for the same assets for possible future use in adjusting the TCBAbased rates The amounts in these memorandum accounts will represent the difference between their current allowed returns and what they may have earned had these generation costs been recovered under traditional cost of service ratemaking in place prior to restructuring The costbased rates so determined the PUC says would comply with the principle that ratepayers pay just and reasonable rates and as costs change would be subject to adjustment The PUC decides that SCE PGE and San Diego Gas Electric SDGE should use their utility retained generation URG in the following order to serve their existing customers at costofservice based rates sell power at costbased rates to other California investorowned utilities and sell or barter excess power from URG to minimize future costs The PUC directs that if any surplus generation exists it should first be offered to other California IOUs at costbased rates with any net proceeds to benefit instate ratepayers URG consists of utilityowned generation and longterm purchased power contracts Since the December order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC ending the investorowned utilities obligation to sell all of their energy produced through the Power Exchange PX and buy all of their energy requirements from the PX the socalled buysell requirement utilities had no regulatory direction for using and pricing their retained generation In lieu of an evidentiary hearing because of the need to protect the public interest during this time of nearly continuous Stage supply emergencies the PUC now provides this direction The PUC makes SDGE a party to the URG aspects of its order while the PUC does not apply the DWR delivery and pricing rules to SDGE at this time The AB X law does not exclude SDGEs retail customers from receiving DWR power but the PUC opts not to require DWR power to go them at this time In this interim order adopted on the PUC says it does not end the rate freeze set an interim valuation or otherwise provide a basis for ending the rate freeze As far as it addresses the pricing and use of utilities retained generation the order only sets an interim basis for pricing the power utilities continue to produce and provide to their customers since the effectively defunct PX no longer fulfills this function Residual Pricing of DWR Power Because of the provisions of AB X which was enacted the day after the PUC adopted its order the PUC must price DWR power residually or as a percentage of what each SCE and PGE retail end use customer currently pays them for energy The utilities energy charges are currently frozen at different levels for each utility and each customer class The percentage is calculated by dividing the amount of power provided by DWR and delivered by the utility by the total amount of power generated or purchased by the utility and the amount of power in item The amount of power purchased by the utility includes purchases from QFs and others for resale as well as any energy they purchase in the ISOs real time market This percentage or ratio will be calculated daily The PUC provides the following example if a utility generates and purchases MWh of power and delivers along with it MWh of DWR power for a total of MWh each customer owes DWR of the energy charge in their rates for the power they used that day Utilities will collect these amounts from customers on behalf of DWR and hold the amounts in trust for DWR As the law requires the calculation of the amounts to be collected on the basis of the megawatt hours DWR actually purchases and delivers while calculating the amounts it is entitled to recover from utilities retail customers in dollars of costs there is a built in potential for DWRs costs to be under recovered depending on how the actual price DWR pays for each MWh matches up with the utilities existing frozen energy charges The PUC says that making the utilities liable for any shortfall in the recovery of DWRs costs satisfies the legislative concern that the State recover the funds expended If the two cashstrapped nearly bankrupt utilities are liable for substantial amounts to make DWR whole these amounts would likely only add to the approximately billion in unpaid overdue purchased power costs they have already accumulated Following the provisions of AB X the PUC sets the DWR price of power upon resale as equal to DWRs purchased power costs plus administrative costs transmission and scheduling costs and other related costs less any overpayments DWR may subsequently recover from suppliers Again following the provisions of AB X the PUC directs DWR to retain title to its power until sold to the utilities retail end use customers and reminds that under the new statute neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California may be pledged for the payment for any obligation The PUC orders the two cashstrapped utilities to deliver DWR power to retail customers and directs the utilities to take no ownership or other interest in DWR power acting only in an administrative capacity as billing agents for DWR The PUCs interim order is posted on its web site at PUBLISHEDFINALDECISIONhtm For your convenience attached is an MS Rich Text Format file containing this analysis and full summary

PRIVATE Set forth is a brief summary of my call with John Pirog last night Overall I felt we made a lot of progress At the end of the call Pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible but at the end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our consideration on a few of the points We said that we would be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that we could then compare notes He said that CDWR viewed the Enron Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly quickly Material Regulatory Change Provision Pirog said CDWR would be willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects CDWRs ability to perform under the contract most particularly its ability to pay for power Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or regulatory generated change Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to a termination payment if this occurred although they may not want the MRC to be characterized as a default which should not be a problem from our standpoint CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change eg in law that materially affects EPMIs business but does not adversely affect CDWRs ability to make payments to EPMI For example a new CA law that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the CPUC Further as we anticipated he said CDWR was not willing to be on the hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control such as a FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us However he did say that CDWR might entertain a no LD walk right for EPMI if such a change adversely affected it My sense is that ultimately PirogCDWR will back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying LDs Early Walk Provision He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered it was discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk from the deal without receiving or paying a Termination Payment up until a date certain September and September were mentioned by me as possibilities although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA Treasurers office about the bond issue provided that if the bonds were issued earlier than that the walk away right would terminate that is EPMI would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date Termination Payment Due Date Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from days He said all other suppliers have lived with that Pirog is sympathetic to our concerns but said that the bond guys are already nervous about only having days if they had to issue bonds to pay the LDs Suspension of Delivery Emphasizing our concern with the days I requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend perfromance in the event of an event of default and perhaps some other events such as a bond downgrade Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with us on that Downgrade not a Default CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an event of default However he said CDWR would be willing to consider having a Downgrade Event a no LD walk right for EPMI and perhaps an event justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries In other words a Downgrade Event would be treated like an Event of Default but no termination payment would be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance Pirog also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event that no bonds were issued That is if no Bonds were outstanding and the Fund did not have an investment grade rating we could terminate but without LDs Cross Defaults This clearly is one of CDWRs hot buttons and we will not be able to get this is my sense However when asked about the idea of a Cross Default Out wout a termination payment he stated that he would like to discuss that further with CDWR LD Calculation Methodology Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would accept our proposed language He said they are striving for consistency among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more objective My sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general Arbitration In general Pirog did not have a problem except for the following a desire to limit it to contractual claims only ie no tort actions extracontractual disputes etc would be subject to it Also holding hearings in New York City was not well received and a request was made that all three arbitrators be neutral I would think that the situs issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise My general sense however is that this is not a deal breaker for CDWR Assignment In general he understood the nature of our changes on this issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue as well they are looking for some consistency We were again asked if assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable even though he knew what our reaction would be Pirog offered to provide us sample language which we said we would look at We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult sell in light of the environment He did not elaborate on how stringent the assignment standards are in the other deals New Govt Charge Pass Throughs A pass through of some governmental charges was considered to be okay but he said our proposed language was too broad Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this He di agre howeve that if for example CA imposed an excess profits tax that it was fair for us to be protected from that Legal Opinions Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would be forthcoming although he did say that he would look into whether or not they would be providing one on the bonds Also he said it was a possibility that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds so we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins Realistically it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to extend the option perhaps we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that before our walk right expires Additional CDWR Covenants Pirog stated that the additional covenants we have requested are conceptually okay with him but need to be discussed internally with CDWR Pro Rata Spread Amortization Pirog had not reviewed the idea of amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term and said that he would run it by CDWR CDWR Information Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it plans to give suppliers financial information He was resisting our request for monthly information although I pointed out that we really only wanted information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things

contract is the EEI Master let me know if you need that standard form Call w any questionscomments Elizabeth Forwarded by Elizabeth SagerHOUECT on PM JOHN G KLAUBERG LGMCOM AM To cc MICHAEL W E DIDRIKSEN LGMCOM Subject Revised Draft John as per your request attached are revised drafts of the Confirmation and Cover Sheet which are blacklined against the respective documents from the shortterm deal I recognize that you are still reviewing certain questionspoints with CDWR and there may be some items reflected in this draft that neither you nor CDWR has signed off on Nonetheless in certain cases I thought it made sense to provide you with specific contract language on some of the points we discussed so that you could clearly see what we may be proposing on a particular item Please note in particular the following on the LD calculation we reverted to your proposed language on obtaining multiple market quotes etc However after talking to Enron this evening we would like to propose that if quotes cannot be obtained despite the parties good faith efforts to do so then only in that circumstance would the calculation be based on the NonDefaulting Partys losses While based on the product Enron is selling we anticipate that quotes will be readily obtainable we think it makes sense to revert to the NonDefaulting Partys loss calculation in the highly unlikely event that quotes are not obtainable despite using all efforts to do so I know that you expressed some reservations the other evening that this process potentially could be subject to some manipulation This is not so If CDWR was the Defaulting Party and it disputes the loss calculation made by Enron such dispute would become the subject of arbitration In such case the NonDefaulting Partys would have to furnish its historical and current power curves to prove its case Since those same figures necessarily are needed by Enron to report its trading positions on a day to day basis as part of its normal business operations and such information feeds directly into its financial reporting statements and other relevant financial information etc that becomes in part part of its SEC filings in a discovery proceeding this information would be very transparent with respect to the situs of any arbitration proceeding Enron strongly believes that it is only fair to both parties that this be conducted in a neutral site The draft provides for New York City although Enron is open to other possible locations the revised draft reflects only the MWh alternative scenario since you indicated that preliminarily you felt that CDWR would not be likely to choose the alternative structure we had discussed we would like to further discuss the effect of an adverse federal regulatory change Im sure you can appreciate this in light of the current environment although we would think that freely negotiated bilateral contracts would not be subject to the types of changes being discussed Enron is not seeking a termination right with LDs but would like to further discuss a termination right without compensation in the event of a major adverse federal development affecting the contract we have dropped our request that Enron have the right to suspend performance in the case of a Bond downgrade event However we think it is appropriate that if that circumstance occurs that the due date for payments by CDWR should shorten to days and if the Bonds are subsequently upgraded that the payment schedule would revert accordingly you requested that we propose a limit on the right of a NonDefaulting Party to suspend its performance in the case of a Default by the Defaulting Party We included a NERC day limit on such right in the revised draft This is important to Enron as we discussed particularly in light of Enrons acceptance of the day period on the timing of a Termination Payment which as you know is unheard of in the power sale or virtually any other arena Nonetheless we fully understand the position enunciated by the bond people on this point on assignment the Enron commercial people cannot agree to a preapproved right of CDWR to assign the contract to the IOUs As we discussed it may very well be the case that at the time any assignment were to be effected that Enron may already be at the limit of its overall exposure with those counter parties It cant be in a position where such an assignment could cause it to violate those limits we included an outside date by which Enron must decide whether or not to go forward of the first to occur of September or seven days after the Bonds are issued You had indicated that CDWR might be willing to consider such an outside date as long as i the MWh pricing was in effect from April and Enron had to act very shortly after the Bonds are issued We have proposed days for this in concept we probably will be ok with the alternative of securing a credit rating for the Fund as opposed to the Bonds although we have referred that question to the credit people to make sure in light of your response about opinions not being provided by outside counsel we modified the confirmation to request that the opinions could be from the AG or if CDWR cannot do that then from the GC of CDWR We felt that this would not involve additional work since these presumably will be rendered in connection with the Bonds and we provided that they generally would be provided to us after the Bonds are issued I think the foregoing represent most of the items we had discussed Please let me know when you wish to discuss Also it may make sense for our next call to have the respective Enron and CDWR commercial folks on the call since it may be the case that many of the final decisions involved may be commercial ones Lastly please note that while we have discussed most of the points addressed in the revised drafts with Enron in order to expedite the process we are sending these drafts simultaneously to you and Enron Thus it is possible that Enron may have further modifications or changes to the documents Thanks We look forward to working with you to finalize the requisite documents John This email including attachments contains

nron Christi L CT Linda NRON Richard nron cc Subject Three strikes bill hits California et al From todays Gas Daily Three strikes bill hits California California Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza a Democrat will introduce a bill today that will make it a felony for any energy supplier in California to engage in a conspiracy to drive up prices or manipulate the market The bill would apply to any company selling gas or electricity into the state or to any of the states utilities said a spokesman for Cardoza Under terms of the proposed legislation offenders would be subject to Californias three strikes law which sentences convicted felons to jail for life after three offenses Directors officers or any other employees associated with market manipulation of a company would be subject to this bill the spokesman said Cardoza will introduce the bill at a press conference today at pm Pacific time CD No easy solutions to crisis The crisis in California is far beyond shortterm fixes parading as potential solutions and there is no turning back for deregulation in the state according to a report released yesterday by consulting firm Andersen California has no choice but to forge ahead in repairing the damage that illplanned deregulation measures have caused the Energy Crisis in the Western US Lessons for navigating regulatory and market minefields report says Theres a common wisdom that knows you cant unscramble the egg said Matt Smith head of Andersens North American energy consulting practice All that can be done is correct the mistakes he added In addition steps must be implemented to prevent the spread of the California virus to other states electricity marketplaces Smith said To begin in our view the energy crisis in the western US has produced formidable challenges for utility industry regulators state and federal policymakers and industry executives Smith said The virus spawned in California requires new strategies to contain and reverse the damage The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far beyond the western United States Unfortunately California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis The proposed solutions put in motion by federal and state regulators as well as California policymakers have only led to an increasingly uncertain market and tension among those working for a viable resolution the report says In reaction to the breakdown many of Californias political leaders now prefer to abandon deregulation the report says The report concludes that power shortages and blackouts are inevitable this summer The deregulated marketplace which took a year to throw off track will more than likely take a number of years to put right the report says MCM Competing evidence clouds Calif investigation Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission the California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the states current energy crisis In the efforts to find a smoking gun legislators have leane d heavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group a consultancy commissioned by utility Southern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse But the states biggest transporter of gas to California El Paso Natu ral Gas is not ready to take the rap The pipeline has commissioned its own study which i t recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation As reported in both the trade press and national media SoCal Ed and the CP UC are pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde r prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding And exhibit A in their case against El Paso is The Brattle Groups study of the California market Richard Zeiger a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg chairman of the California Assembly Judiciary Committee told Gas Daily that The Brattle Groups market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not caused by normal market forces GD His remarks followed an oversight hearing during which Assembly members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in the California market El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly In a repor t presented to legislators a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence of factors not a conspiracy caused the price runup Lukens Consulting Group a Houstonbased consultancy was retained by El Pa so to conduct work on several fronts In its study of the California market Lukens concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the main culprits in the California gas price imbroglio Assemblyman John Campbell a Republican member of the oversight committee said he didnt see any smoking gun in either report We had our committee hearing and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle Study and a little on the Lukens study To some degree Im not sure that the California legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies Campbell said I believe FERC is looking at this situation and it would seem to me that thats the appropriate place Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines Its being pushed basically by the Public Utilities Commission here which believes that there was collusion by pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California he said The CPUC Campbell suggested sought satisfaction before the California assembly when it had failed on the federal level Theres a concerted effort not jus t on natural gas but on other things here in California for entities and organizations here to point the finger elsewhere for the problems that were having in this state and I think youre seein g some of that with the public utilities commission Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas prices is a different matter entirely In the meanwhile the dueling California market studies se em to have taken on a life of their own The Brattle Group Study for instance has become the center of a heavily litigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market participants Following on a request by SoCal Ed which said it needed additional data to round out The Brattle Group report FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading Several parties resisted FERCs call for market information saying the requested data contained commercially sensitive information FERC allowed the discovery process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting access to evidence GD Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their case The commission recently dismissed the CPUCs claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy In addressing the California Assembly representatives of Dynegy said that FERCs recent ruling on th e California border controversy obviated the need for more investigation The controversy however is far from over FERC last month also ordered a hearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv e up the price of gas delivered into California GD That hearing is likely to take place this summer RP et al NH

CT Dale CT cc Subject California Energy UpdateFYI Forwarded by Sheila TweedHOUECT on AM AM To cc Subject California Energy Update Members of the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Subcommittee opened hearings today on the Memorandum of Understanding MOU between Southern California Edison Company SCE Edison International EIX and the California Department of Water and Power CDWR Testifying on behalf of SCE were SCE Vice President Bob Foster and Ann Cohen Additional hearings will be scheduled next week at which time the subcommittee will hear from representatives of the Governor the Attorney General and CDWR Among other things committee members questioned the wisdom of acquiring the transmission system particularly on an as is basis the price to be paid alternative structures that would not require an acquisition by the state and the rate of return on new investment in the utility Also in Sacramento the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market is scheduled to continue its investigation Thursday on market manipulation Governor Davis representatives have been negotiating a transaction with Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co to buy the utilitys transmission assets The Governors representatives expect to have an agreement within one to two weeks Also today Governor Davis announced the appointment of Richard Sklar to head a team that will speed the construction of power plants in the state The Governors Generation Implementation Taskforce will work to bring electrical generation facilities on line by coordinating state permitting siting finance design and construction efforts in a one stop shop At its open meeting this evening the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC approved an order addressing market monitoring and mitigation for California wholesale power markets Based on the FERC staff presentation and discussion during the meeting it appears that the market monitoring and mitigation plan for California includes the following a requirement that all generators which entered into a Participating Generator Agreement with the ISO and all nonpublic utilities in California that sell into the ISOs realtime market or use the ISO transmission grid must offer all available electric capacity during all hours to the ISO realtime market except for hydroelectric units all public utility load serving entities in California must submit demand bids in realtime markets during all hours all sales by market participants that have been granted authority by the FERC to sell power at marketbased rates are subject to a refund condition to prevent anticompetitive bids into real time markets the ISO is required to submit weekly reports to the FERC on scheduled outages and bid data to facilitate market monitoring all sales into the ISO realtime market during a period of reserve deficiency ie during Stage or emergencies will be subject to price mitigation The FERC order will include a formula that the ISO will be required to apply for purposes of calculating a proxy price for all such sales The order will also enhance the ISOs ability to coordinate and control planned outages The mitigation plan will be in effect for a oneyear period and will be subject to periodic review The FERC is also requiring the ISO and the investorowned utilities to submit a filing by June to form a Regional Transmission Organization RTO If an RTO filing is not submitted by that date then the market monitoring and mitigation plan will terminate automatically The FERC is also directing the parties to work with RTO West an RTO approved for the Pacific Northwest to develop a plan for including California within RTO West with a goal of ultimately creating one RTO for the entire western interconnection Finally the FERC is instituting an investigation under Section of the Federal Power Act with respect to wholesale power sales throughout the western interconnection Apparently potential refund liability would apply to wholesale power sale transactions in the western interconnection entered into for a period of hours or less and made when reserve deficiencies are or less FERC also approved the formation of RTO West an eightstate RTO combining the transmission assets of nine utilities in the Pacific Northwest The FERC asked the RTO to make a submission to it by December of this year on its plans for including Canadian transmission and widening the scope of its operations in a broader regional system RTO West first submitted its plans to the FERC last October It includes nine electric utilities serving eight western states with some miles of transmission lines The nine utilities include Avista BPA Idaho Power Montana Power Nevada Power PacifiCorp Portland General Electric Puget Sound Energy and Sierra Pacific The states where the RTO West would operate are Washington Oregon Idaho Nevada Utah and parts of Montana Wyoming and California A more detailed

<24805564.1075853447418.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,elizabeth.sager@enron.com,2001-04-30 05:13:00,Re PGE and Enron StandStill Agreement Cc In accordance with our conversation late last week I am enclosing a revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was discussed on Wednesday My comments primarily involve the following As you and I discussed last week I thought it made sense to specify a reasonable date by which Enron and PGE shall have reached closure on a settlement agreement on the contract termination and related claims I proposed a one month period to do that If the parties cant come to an agreement in that time period then the mechanics in the MPA for re solving a dispute dealing with the calculation of the termination payment would be reactivated Obviously if we are making progress the parties can always extend the date I felt it was appropriate to specify the window period to make sure that everyone is focused on attempting to get a prompt resolution Assuming a final settlement agreement is agreed upon the conditions of the extension of the stay would be embodied in the settlement agreement itself as opposed to this letter Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in place while t he parties were working to see if a settlement agreement could be reached and that requirement is reflected in our revisions to the letter Thus the revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the Initial Extensi on Period ie to May Your draft had provided that Enron wou ld be required to keep the LCs in place even if no settlement agreement were to b e reached My view is that any requirement to maintain the LCs beyond the Initial Extension Period and any conditions with respect thereto if agreed to by Enron should be part of the final settlement agreement executed by t he parties rather than as part of this letter Also we note that as a contractual matter the MPA does not require the nondefaulting party to ke ep in place any security in favor of the defaulting party when as a result of a termination the nondefaulting party owes a payment to the defaulting part y See Sec Your draft of the letter provided that Enron agrees to enter in to new master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on commercially reasonable terms The revised letter specifies that Enron agrees to negotiate with PGE in these respects simultaneously with the negotiations towards a settlement agreement but any commitment on Enrons part to ef fect a contract or transaction with PGE will only arise as a result of the parties execution of the definitive transaction documents as opposed t o this letter the execution of which shall be in the sole discretion of eac h of the parties Please call me at your convenience to discuss any questions on the foregoin g or on the revised letter Thanks in advance for your help in moving this forward Elizabeth Sager Witalis Lawrence Law PM To cc Kuga Roy Wan Fong Corp Sena David Foley Jack Pearce Karola Law Harvey Kent BarLev Joshua Law Subject StandStill Agreement Ms Sager Attached is my draft of an agreement memorializing the parties respective commitments as we negotiate the amount of the Termination Payment and of other claims Enron may have against PGE in Bankruptcy Court I do not hav e your mailing address yet PGE would like to receive assurance soon that Enron agrees with the terms of this proposed letter agreement After reviewing the draft please indicate Enrons agreement by return email to me Or please call me to discuss Thanks Larry Witalis enrondocrtf enrondocrtf

Elizabeth CT cc Subject FYI Western Power Market Stands Poised on the Precipice According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting Groups Bulk Power Outlook FAIRFAX Va June PRNewswire Power markets in the Western System Coordinating Council are poised on the precipice of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer and next according to a new study of the regional market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group The West stands at least a one in three chance of experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during the summer of said Judah Rose a Senior Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study ICFs analysis of the West points to a number of key nearterm implications Regional Capacity Deficits The region is in a delicate supplydemand balance with most subregions of the West relying on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet nearterm peak capacity requirements Because demand growth is outpacing new supply additions those deficits will only become more extreme over the next two years Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence A fifth consecutive year of aboveaverage hydroelectric generation the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus will again mask the Wests precarious supplydemand balance in However if the drought conditions of the early s resurface the West will find itself at an even greater risk of price spikes Upward Pressure on Prices Prices are on an upward trend for and the result of both higher regional spot natural gas prices and the increasing value of pure capacity the value of ensuring reliability for consumers The study also evaluates the longterm future of the Western market and highlights the following key results Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily The regions underlying demand growth is strong creating a longterm regional capacity need totaling more than MW by unless there is a serious economic downturn in the region Energy Prices Trending Downward The trend for longterm energy prices is for negative real growth through but the region will remain susceptible to nearterm volatility while market institutions continue to evolve and new supply is slowly added over the next few years Capacity Prices Rising Slowly Current low capacity values will continue to rise but still remain below many other regions as new more efficient generation is added Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices Gas demand for power generation is poised to more than double by with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest subregions Even so the West regions vast gas supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little if any real price appreciation through The Western US Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook along with the

AM From Christi L Nicolay on PM To Betsy Carr ENRON cc Elizabeth CT Mary CT Subject Re Christi this is generating a lot of interest Elizabeth Sager has been working on the EEI contract for Enron Betsy Carr on PM To Christi L CT cc Subject Christi this is generating a lot of interest Christi this is generating a lot of interest By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesEt tu Sonnet The Edison Electric Institute unveiled Wednesday a standardized master agreement for trading power but theres already a standard contract the one written by the Western Systems Power Pool There are several ways to characterize this battle East versus West power marketers versus utilities and even Southern Co versus Southern Co A power struggle has begun despite the fact that most traders preschedulers and trading managers arent even aware of the new contract Southern Co SO Vice President Bobby Campo has been a leader in WSPP since the organizations inception and has been chairman of its contract committee for four years Yet Southern Co Energy Marketings chief counsel Sonnet Edmonds is a leader in the rivalcontract faction Will EEI along with its comrade the National Energy Marketers Association manage to dethrone the WSPP contract or crash WSPPs raison detre is to manage and promote use of its contract which is traded extensively in the West and has gained proponents in the East Im not real excited about it right now Campo said of the new contract The EEI contract is being done by contract people and lawyers We operators and power marketers worked on our contract for years before we brought in the lawyers It the new contract may die from a lack of interest from participants but EEI has the ability to keep it alive It isnt clear if the big power marketing companies will get the ball rolling by asking counterparties to switch to the EEI contract Edmonds hopes that Southern Co will do so Management hasnt given the official word yet but we participated in its development so I imagine well use it at some point she said Enron Corps ENE general counsel also worked on the EEI contract but the company hasnt made a decision to actually use it Entergy Corps ETR general counsel Christopher Bernard led the effort to develop the new contract as head of NEMs standardized contract committee But Entergys Jim Kenney is chairman of WSPPs executive committee Entergys power trading managers meanwhile havent even read the new contract yet Duke Power Co DUK an NEM member is looking at it a spokesman said Enron and Southern Co arent NEM members though they serve on its contract committee Several sources said American Electric Power AEP has agreed to be the guinea pig and plans to switch to the EEI contract with counterparties on eastern US trades A spokesman for the utility couldnt confirm or deny that rumor because Paul Addis president of AEP Energy Services has imposed a vow of silence on AEPs traders There are elements of the EEI contract that power marketers may like One innovation is a new product called Firm No Force Majeure which requires the payment of liquidated damages for failure to deliver no excuses no force majeure just send a check The new contract also has two other firm products Firm Liquidated Damages is closest to the WSPP firm product but it defines force majeure more strictly than WSPP Firm LDSystem Reliability explicitly allows a selling utility to curtail deliveries without paying liquidated damages if necessary to maintain native load Of particular interest to traders of eastern US electricity is the fact that the EEI contract defines what an into product is WSPP has debated the introduction of such products but in the end has tried to come up with a single agreedupon product for trading EEI has created a lot of different types of firm products but that can create problems Many people have said no we want one firm product said WSPPs counsel Michael Small of Washington DC law firm Wright and Talisman So why didnt the EEI group just work with WSPP to get changes made to the existing standard Too much bureaucracy according to Southerns Edmonds Changes to the WSPP contract require approval from of the members after working through the operations committee and the executive committee Then the changes have to be filed at Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Edmonds said Coincidentally WSPPs executive committee is meeting Friday in San Diego to discuss what changes are needed in the definition of its firm product Western utilities are pushing hard for firm to mean backed up by reserves of generating assets or previously purchased power In other words some utilities want to eliminate short positions from power markets At least one power marketing company which didnt want to be named will switch to the EEI contract if that change gets made to WSPP For the EEI contract to fly not only will the lawyers at the big trading companies need to make it their companies standard but traders will have to convince utilities to abandon most if not all force majeure claims Many municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives are forbidden to do so by state regulations For traders though the biggest adjustment to make if the EEI contract does take off will be more social than professional The semiannual meeting of the WSPPs operations committee is as much fun as any blatant boondoggle should be The serious work of a handful of committee members is a small hook on which hangs the revelry of hundreds of power marketers brokers and utility staffers As it stands noncommittee members must have a hard time convincing bosses that their presence is necessary at the meeting How on earth will traders justify going if the WSPP contract is no longer used Can EEI throw a good party And how will the Gucciloafered EEI executives from Washington handle dares to go naked in a bar Such are the questions now vexing Americas electric utilities By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires Copyright c

this is what the article ended up looking like Original Message From Brown Steve Sent Monday November AM To Edmonds Sonnet Subject FW Dow article from this morning You are mentioned in this Dow Article Original Message From Markham Robert F Sent Monday November AM To Brown Steve Soto Oscar Subject FW Dow article from this morning DJ Power Points EEI Contract Will This Dog Hunt Nov CM Dow Jones Capital Markets Report By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesEt tu Sonnet The Edison Electric Institute unveiled Wednesday a standardized master agreement for trading power but theres already a standard contract the one written by the Western Systems Power Pool There are several ways to characterize this battle East versus West power marketers versus utilities and even Southern Co versus Southern Co A power struggle has begun despite the fact that most traders preschedulers and trading managers arent even aware of the new contract Southern Co SO Vice President Bobby Campo has been a leader in WSPP since the organizations inception and has been chairman of its contract committee for four years Yet Southern Co Energy Marketings chief counsel Sonnet Edmonds is a leader in the rivalcontract faction Will EEI along with its comrade the National Energy Marketers Association manage to dethrone the WSPP contract or crash WSPPs raison detre is to manage and promote use of its contract which is traded extensively in the West and has gained proponents in the East Im not real excited about it right now Campo said of the new contract The EEI contract is being done by contract people and lawyers We operators and power marketers worked on our contract for years before we brought in the lawyers It the new contract may die from a lack of interest from participants but EEI has the ability to keep it alive It isnt clear if the big power marketing companies will get the ball rolling by asking counterparties to switch to the EEI contract Edmonds hopes that Southern Co will do so Management hasnt given the official word yet but we participated in its development so I imagine well use it at some point she said Enron Corps ENE general counsel also worked on the EEI contract but the company hasnt made a decision to actually use it Entergy Corps ETR general counsel Christopher Bernard led the effort to develop the new contract as head of NEMs standardized contract committee But Entergys Jim Kenney is chairman of WSPPs executive committee Entergys power trading managers meanwhile havent even read the new contract yet Duke Power Co DUK an NEM member is looking at it a spokesman said Enron and Southern Co arent NEM members though they serve on its contract committee Several sources said American Electric Power AEP has agreed to be the guinea pig and plans to switch to the EEI contract with counterparties on eastern US trades A spokesman for the utility couldnt confirm or deny that rumor because Paul Addis president of AEP Energy Services has imposed a vow of silence on AEPs traders There are elements of the EEI contract that power marketers may like One innovation is a new product called Firm No Force Majeure which requires the payment of liquidated damages for failure to deliver no excuses no force majeure just send a check The new contract also has two other firm products Firm Liquidated Damages is closest to the WSPP firm product but it defines force majeure more strictly than WSPP Firm LDSystem Reliability explicitly allows a selling utility to curtail deliveries without paying liquidated damages if necessary to maintain native load Of particular interest to traders of eastern US electricity is the fact that the EEI contract defines what an into product is WSPP has debated the introduction of such products but in the end has tried to come up with a single agreedupon product for trading EEI has created a lot of different types of firm products but that can create problems Many people have said no we want one firm product said WSPPs counsel Michael Small of Washington DC law firm Wright and Talisman So why didnt the EEI group just work with WSPP to get changes made to the existing standard Too much bureaucracy according to Southerns Edmonds Changes to the WSPP contract require approval from of the members after working through the operations committee and the executive committee Then the changes have to be filed at Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Edmonds said Coincidentally WSPPs executive committee is meeting Friday in San Diego to discuss what changes are needed in the definition of its firm product Western utilities are pushing hard for firm to mean backed up by reserves of generating assets or previously purchased power In other words some utilities want to eliminate short positions from power markets At least one power marketing company which didnt want to be named will switch to the EEI contract if that change gets made to WSPP For the EEI contract to fly not only will the lawyers at the big trading companies need to make it their companies standard but traders will have to convince utilities to abandon most if not all force majeure claims Many municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives are forbidden to do so by state regulations For traders though the biggest adjustment to make if the EEI contract does take off will be more social than professional The semiannual meeting of the WSPPs operations committee is as much fun as any blatant boondoggle should be The serious work of a handful of committee members is a small hook on which hangs the revelry of hundreds of power marketers brokers and utility staffers As it stands noncommittee members must have a hard time convincing bosses that their presence is necessary at the meeting How on earth will traders justify going if the WSPP contract is no longer used Can EEI throw a good party And how will the Gucciloafered EEI executives from Washington handle dares to go naked in a bar Such are the questions now vexing Americas electric utilities By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires EST
