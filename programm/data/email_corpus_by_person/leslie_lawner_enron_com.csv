<30670812.1075843432749.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,leslie.lawner@enron.com,2001-04-18 12:27:00,Todays hearing at the CPUCis an update of events at the CPUC rate design hearing today The first panel was the Agriculture folks California Farm Bureau Cal League of Food Processors and Leprino biggest producer of mozarella cheese They generally support the Governors proposal and the ability of ag processors to switch to agricultural rate schedules but admitted that this would lead to revenue shortfalls which PGE and others were quick to jump on They want the ability to switch to ag rate schedules to avoid rate shock The ALJ was very interested in the different segments of ag and their needs loads and usage patterns Info on this will be filed by next week fruit and nut usage annual crop usage processing wine dairy beef and poultry The County of Los Angeles witness testified that as a big customer of SCE they wanted to protect essential services from huge rate hikes and that special rate treatment should be afforded to those loads identified in the exemption from rolling blackouts Any unrecovered costs should be collected from all customers except CARE and residential up to He supported allocating the increase in the same proportion costs are allocated to rate classes as in total current revenues not just generation revenues He also cautioned against imposing excessive charges on peak load as this will encourage load shifting and not conservation This became a theme for the afternoon is load shifting conservation and therefore a good thing or is it NOT conservation and a bad thing that will drive up nonpeak prices The Federal Executive Agencies witness Brubaker would use cost of service to the extent possible to allocate the increase The impact of any special arrangements made to avoid increases must be picked up by someone else There is not enough detailed generation information or time to make a fair allocation so use of a proxy is necessary This should be the use of existing recover of generation costs by class resulting in an equal percentage increase in rates The classes reflect different cost incurrence factors and an equal cents per kwh is not justified Residential shortfall should stay in that class TOU and E and rates should reflect a peak price two times that of the nonpeak Tiering of TOU customers already gives adequate price signals Costbased rates are most fair and give best price signals Tiering is a shortterm solution and metering is not in place to handle cost based rates yet There were some questions on how that cost basis would be determined since generation prices are apparently more than costbased and also questions on what the appropriate differential should be between peak and offpeak rates as they may be converging Schoenbeck with Energy Producers and Consumers that should cover everyone supported a spread between off and on peak and allocated all of the increase to the onpeak rate with a market cap of cents His proposal is a allocation of costs between onpeak and off He was questioned as well on whether load shifting was conservation and he stated that it is a costsaving measure and his proposal allows each customer to find his or her own solution to the increase in costs He was also questioned whether load shifting might not cause mid and off peak prices to rise This depends on resource availability he answered but it could He also testified that the cents charge should not be applied to DA customers CIUs Chalfant testified briefly and will be called back He stated that his proposal does things it passes the equity test cost based no rate shock with even increases among classes anad reduces peak usage using top hours and uses an approved CPUC methodology For TOU and E of rate increase would be collected in the summer and of that would be collected during peak hours Forgive my typing errors Tomorrow up are Kinder Morgan Street Lighting Aglet Consumers and CLECA
<30320190.1075843434822.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,leslie.lawner@enron.com,2001-04-19 12:22:00,Todays hearing at the CPUCfeel like a reporter in a warzone The morning was taken up with Barbara Barkovich testifying for CLECA and CMTA She is a sharp witness and no one got anything off her she didnt want to give She gave a long prepared statement that addressed equity considerations conservation and added that reliability is a key factor to consider and that any allocation and rate design should encourage efficieny use of energy should not disadvantage nay particular group disproportionately and should discourage use in the periods most likely to see outages The Top hours as an allocator is equitable as it is an allocator that both accounts for capacity and energy use Barkovich had no problems with SCEs billing determinants but did have issues with PGEs as she couldnt figure out the appropraite revenue requirement from their exhibits and workpapers She forgot to exclude CARE costs in her calculations everyone else did too She noted that the classes all have customers with wide ranges of usage and rates should be designed to encourage conservation Tiering might be a way to do that but the problem is that the utilities have said that they cant do that right now CLECA and CMTA do have different approaches CMTA wants significant rate increases in the onpeak rates a lesser increase for mid peak and an even lesser increase for offpeak They prefer a broader spreading of costs than CLECA SInce no one knows what the DWR contracts look like we cannot predict what if any shortfalls will occur in revenue collection The CLECA proposal to collect costs on peak will create the biggest bang for the buck in terms of reducing peak usage If usage shifts enough that the peak needs to be redefined this can be done in a rate case Another problem with tiering is that while the utilities do have records of each customers historic usage that information may not be readily available to the billing systems and may not be easy to get at She noted that a study is coming out tomorrow showing the impact of rolling blackouts on Northern California businesses and will send that report in to the hearing examiner She favors an even handed approach to increasing prices and does not want to reallocate costs Keep the residential shortfall in the residential class There will be some reallocation necessary to keep ag rates from being increased all the way The goal is to avoid reallocation as much as possible Practical considerations argue against setting an arbitrary kwh breakpoint as some classes have a wide variety of users Tiering should be customerspecific and we need to find a way to do this The variablity of usage in the residential class is much less than other classes and so tiering is less of an issue The Top method allocates costs based on the classs relative share of of peak usage during the hours of highest demand This means both demand and usage She agreed that DA customers should not pay the surcharge as the power is not being purchased for them Shells attorney questioned Barkovich at length about whether we shouldnt redevelop rates here from the bottom up and only charge DA customers for TD and other costs properly allocated to them nuke decommissioning public programs Ms B noted that that would mean they would not pay CTC and would affect the PX credit The Street and Traffic light witness testified and if you want to know about the most efficient lights call me Kinder Morgan our old friend Rich Kinder which has products pipelines in CA testified that they want an allocation that places costs on peak power usage to a cap of cents and then also has a setoff to the demand charge to reduce any overrecovery The notion is that a customer who conserves is still paying a demand charge for peak power not used and this is a disincentive to conservation Aglet which is a small consumer group testified that there is no revenue requirement yet since the DWR deals are secret and so they recommend no reallocation of shortfalls since shortfalls cant exist They support a limited dollar impact until the DWR rates are known This may drive the revenue requirements closer to those of the Governors The residential shortfall and the CARE customers should be allocated to all other customers He also supports an equal cents per KWH charge Increasing volatility of prices means you cant base future rates on past costs The world has changes drastically since May and old data is not indicative of future The top hours is a capacity allocator not to be used for the type of costs at issue here Harry goes on either st or nd tomorrow Also up are CIU CEC AReM and possibly ORA
<3676128.1075843436824.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,leslie.lawner@enron.com,2001-04-21 06:53:00,Summary of Harrys testimony and recommendation for briefing Cc type of bunch of this and them my computer died so I have to rewrit e it UGH Harrys testimony was brilliant and here is a summary Harry explained our proposal and how it achieves goals of equity and conservation equity because all customers sacrifice equally and conservation because there will be reductions in usage The other proposa ls in the case arbitrarily allocate costs to peak whereas our proposal will have customers reacting to price signals and if affords flexibility The Hearing Examiner HE asked what services EES provides and whether our customers were DA customers she was trying to get to our real interest in this case which the PGE attorney helped with later Slocum PGE did not understand that our proposal was only for TOU customerrs and asked a lot of questions about implementation problems that were based on implementation for all classesQuestions like moving usage data to billing system turnover in customers lack of data for new customers lack of metering Harry acknowledged that the peak defined by DJ might not match the rate class peak definition and that some adjustments might have to be made Slocum noted that TOU meters do not show hourly usage and that hourly interval meters would need to be installed to make o ur proposal work Harry answered that we recognize that our proposal would ta ke time but that we need to move to this and that customers need price signal s this summer Our proposal is only for TOU customers and for those for whom it cannot be implemented an equal cents per kwh is appropriate Harry noted that we have not taken a position on the proposal that should be adopted for other customer classes yet He was asked where the came from ands he pointed out the derivation th at was in his testimony based on predicted market price and cost of retained generation Two assumptions were made a average market price and customers have same billing determinants for in combination with marke t price assumptions and existing generation rate to get the revenue requirements It is possible that the price may not be and our revenu e requirements may be off but this is true with every other proposal as well The basis for the is the COB and PV Nymex contracts If our proposal cannot be implemented this summer the cent charge sends an adequate and strong signal to consumers across the board When asked wheth er PGE would have to program a different method for TOU customers if Enron s proposal is adopted Harry answered that they already have to program a different method for TOU customers under existing rates PGE asked how th e decremental reward program would be funded Harry noted that it could be funded through the ISO DWR utility bonding The PGE attorney noted that the utilities have been downgraded to junk bond status and couldnt issu e bonds Funding is an issue Then PGE asked if we left the market on Harry answered no We simply began sourcing power from the utility but our contracts are still i n effect She asked Harry what kind of customers we had were they mostly large TOU customers Do they have interval meters She asked if we were o n the hook for the difference between the bundled rate and the contract rate Harry answered that he didnt know on balance what impact our proposal w ould have on our TOU customers Our proposal helps to foster the goals and pursue the incentives to get to the needed solutions in CA He also noted that all parties to this proceeding were proposing methodologies that were most beneficial to them SCE asked a bunch of questions about recovery of TD costs if the target were used Harry answered that any undercollections that may result and this could be true under any of the proposals could be dealt with it a rate case filing They also talked about how the customer would know the daily prices would the utility be obligated to make that info available HK answered that it is forecast a day ahead and is publicly available Then h e was asked whether Enron would fund the decremental reward program Harry noted that we might under the right conditions but this was outside his expertise ORA asked about weather normalization again under the misapprehension that our proposal applied to weather sensitive smaller customers Harry also to ld him that the indices we proposed were very liquid He also handled questio ns on whether a different average price would yield a different break point a nd we need to provide calculations that show an average price of and The Hearing Examiner then asked for Enrons estimates of summer on peak and off peak prices and ruled that we must supply that info by COB Monday ove r counsels objections In general I think there was a lot of confusion about our proposal not understanding that it was only directed to one type of customer There is also a lot of distrust of Enron and I would add dislike as well I do not think the HE will consider any of our proposals seriously and in fact our support on some of the other proposals could be the kiss of death I would keep our brief very short and very limited as we can weigh in on support of the other A and RD methodologies after the HE issues her recommended decision In fact we might even like a proposal she recommends

ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT WITH SDGE SEMPRA ENERGY Per Customer Balloon Payment Eliminated No Additional Rate Increases Required to Pay Off Undercollection SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today announced an agreement with San Diego Gas Electric and the utilitys parent company Sempra Energy that will erase a million balloon payment facing the utilitys three million customers The balloon is burst Governor Davis said Under this agreement the undercollection is eliminated without any increase in rates This is a massive benefit to the San Diegans the first Californians to bear the brunt of our states energy crisis last summer The Memorandum of Understanding MOU signed by the Department of Water Resources for Gov Davis with Sempra Energy and SDGE executives while a group of San Diego ratepayers and State Senators Steve Peace DEl Cajon and Dede Alpert DCoronado looked on includes a number of provisions to eliminate the undercollection that could have cost each customer approximately as much as for each residential customer for each smallcommercial customer and for each mediumsized commercial customer In addition it would settle several regulatory cases before the California Public Utilities Commission PUC gives the State the opportunity to purchase acres of environmentallysensitive lands owned by the company along the Colorado River and provides belowmarket power to the State through December from the San Onofre nuclear power plant The regulatory provisions are subject to PUC approval It also calls for the purchase of SDGEs transmission lines for approximately billion or times book value However the deal is not contingent on that purchase of SDGEs transmission network which includes electric lines exceeding kilovolts in capacity and spans approximately circuit miles from southern Orange County to the Mexican border The system also includes about electric substations and transmission interties with Southern California Edisons system at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station Throughout these long and complex negotiations Governor Davis and we have had the mutual objective of reducing the financial impact of Californias crisis on SDGEs customers and helping the State gain more control over its energy destiny said Stephen L Baum chairman president and chief executive officer of Sempra Energy Todays agreement represents a winning proposition for our customers the State and our company it reduces the future financial burden on our customers protects the States economic future and creates a clear path for future growth and profitability for our company Going forward we are committed to working with Governor Davis and the State to implement his recovery plan The MOU signed today is the second with Californias investorowned utilities An agreement with Southern California Edison is pending approval before the State Legislature Unlike the Edison agreement however the MOU with Sempra Energy does not need legislative approval except for the acquisition of transmission lines This is an example of the good that can come when parties are responsible and remain at the bargaining table Governor Davis said This is a balanced business transaction that benefits ratepayers and provides a stable environment for the States third largest utility Governor Davis said the MOU will not result in any additional electricbaserate increases for SDGE customers to recover the million undercollection Without the MOU future balloon payments to recover this sum could have been as much as per customer The regulatory balancing account for SDGEs undercollected power costs had grown to approximately million since September when the State imposed a retail rate cap of cents per kilowatthour retroactive to May California state law AB signed by Governor Davis last year provided for SDGEs recovery of all its prudently incurred power costs but delegated responsibility to the PUC for determining the method and timeline for recovery The agreement includes a complex package of elements to eliminate the balloon payment such as the settlement of the reasonablenessreview case SDGE had with the PUC To settle that case the utility has agreed to forego collecting million of the balancing account In addition the agreement notes that SDGE agrees to give back percent of the profits on two longterm power contracts earned since the energy crisis flared last June That means SDGE will forego collecting another million in the balancing account The California Department of Water Resources will purchase those contracts as of June SDGE and its sister utility SoCalGas will invest at least billion over six years into capital improvements In addition if the State decides not buy the transmission lines and SDGE builds the Valley Rainbow line the utility backed by Sempra Energy will put another million into transmission line improvements subject to PUC approval Excluding the transmission system improvements this is an increase of million more than the utilities invested in capital improvements in the previous five years and SDGE will drop all legal claims against the State We know that many of our customers are extremely concerned about the potential of large balloon payments looming in the future to address our past undercollections said Edwin A Guiles group president of Sempra Energys regulated business units and chairman of SDGE We are pleased that todays agreement provides the framework to resolve major regulatory issues to the benefit of our customers Many challenges remain but this agreement demonstrates that by working together we can surmount these challenges in a way that benefits all the key stakeholders in Californias energy future The MOU also calls for the Department of Water Resources DWR to continue to buy power for SDGE through the agency until certain conditions are met DWR has been purchasing power for SDGE customers since early February SDGE is a regulated utility operating in San Diego and southern Orange counties Sempra Energy NYSE SRE based in San Diego is a Fortune energy services holding company with annualized revenues of about billion Through its eight principal subsidiaries Southern California Gas Company San Diego Gas Electric Sempra Energy Solutions Sempra Energy Trading Sempra Energy International Sempra Energy Resources Sempra Communications and Sempra Energy Financial the Sempra Energy companies employees serve more than nine million customers in the United States Europe Canada Mexico South America and Asia

Tony Wetzel Email William Hall Email Katie Kaplan Jean Munoz cc Energy Practice Group Subject SEMPRA ENERGY DEAL ANNOUNCED FINALLY OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR PR FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT WITH SDGE SEMPRA ENERGY Per Customer Balloon Payment Eliminated No Additional Rate Increases Required to Pay Off Undercollection SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today announced an agreement with San Diego Gas Electric and the utilitys parent company Sempra Energy that will erase a million balloon payment facing the utilitys three million customers The balloon is burst Governor Davis said Under this agreement the undercollection is eliminated without any increase in rates This is a massive benefit to the San Diegans the first Californians to bear the brunt of our states energy crisis last summer The Memorandum of Understanding MOU signed by the Department of Water Resources for Gov Davis with Sempra Energy and SDGE executives while a group of San Diego ratepayers and State Senators Steve Peace DEl Cajon and Dede Alpert DCoronado looked on includes a number of provisions to eliminate the undercollection that could have cost each customer approximately as much as for each residential customer for each smallcommercial customer and for each mediumsized commercial customer In addition it would settle several regulatory cases before the California Public Utilities Commission PUC gives the State the opportunity to purchase acres of environmentallysensitive lands owned by the company along the Colorado River and provides belowmarket power to the State through December from the San Onofre nuclear power plant The regulatory provisions are subject to PUC approval It also calls for the purchase of SDGEs transmission lines for approximately billion or times book value However the deal is not contingent on that purchase of SDGEs transmission network which includes electric lines exceeding kilovolts in capacity and spans approximately circuit miles from southern Orange County to the Mexican border The system also includes about electric substations and transmission interties with Southern California Edisons system at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station Throughout these long and complex negotiations Governor Davis and we have had the mutual objective of reducing the financial impact of Californias crisis on SDGEs customers and helping the State gain more control over its energy destiny said Stephen L Baum chairman president and chief executive officer of Sempra Energy Todays agreement represents a winning proposition for our customers the State and our company it reduces the future financial burden on our customers protects the States economic future and creates a clear path for future growth and profitability for our company Going forward we are committed to working with Governor Davis and the State to implement his recovery plan The MOU signed today is the second with Californias investorowned utilities An agreement with Southern California Edison is pending approval before the State Legislature Unlike the Edison agreement however the MOU with Sempra Energy does not need legislative approval except for the acquisition of transmission lines This is an example of the good that can come when parties are responsible and remain at the bargaining table Governor Davis said This is a balanced business transaction that benefits ratepayers and provides a stable environment for the States third largest utility Governor Davis said the MOU will not result in any additional electricbaserate increases for SDGE customers to recover the million undercollection Without the MOU future balloon payments to recover this sum could have been as much as per customer The regulatory balancing account for SDGEs undercollected power costs had grown to approximately million since September when the State imposed a retail rate cap of cents per kilowatthour retroactive to May California state law AB signed by Governor Davis last year provided for SDGEs recovery of all its prudently incurred power costs but delegated responsibility to the PUC for determining the method and timeline for recovery The agreement includes a complex package of elements to eliminate the balloon payment such as the settlement of the reasonablenessreview case SDGE had with the PUC To settle that case the utility has agreed to forego collecting million of the balancing account In addition the agreement notes that SDGE agrees to give back percent of the profits on two longterm power contracts earned since the energy crisis flared last June That means SDGE will forego collecting another million in the balancing account The California Department of Water Resources will purchase those contracts as of June SDGE and its sister utility SoCalGas will invest at least billion over six years into capital improvements In addition if the State decides not buy the transmission lines and SDGE builds the Valley Rainbow line the utility backed by Sempra Energy will put another million into transmission line improvements subject to PUC approval Excluding the transmission system improvements this is an increase of million more than the utilities invested in capital improvements in the previous five years and SDGE will drop all legal claims against the State We know that many of our customers are extremely concerned about the potential of large balloon payments looming in the future to address our past undercollections said Edwin A Guiles group president of Sempra Energys regulated business units and chairman of SDGE We are pleased that todays agreement provides the framework to resolve major regulatory issues to the benefit of our customers Many challenges remain but this agreement demonstrates that by working together we can surmount these challenges in a way that benefits all the key stakeholders in Californias energy future The MOU also calls for the Department of Water Resources DWR to continue to buy power for SDGE through the agency until certain conditions are met DWR has been purchasing power for SDGE customers since early February SDGE is a regulated utility operating in San Diego and southern Orange counties Sempra Energy NYSE SRE based in San Diego is a Fortune energy services holding company with annualized revenues of about billion Through its eight principal subsidiaries Southern

so I have to rewrit e it UGH Harrys testimony was brilliant and here is a summary Harry explained our proposal and how it achieves goals of equity and conservation equity because all customers sacrifice equally and conservation because there will be reductions in usage The other proposa ls in the case arbitrarily allocate costs to peak whereas our proposal will have customers reacting to price signals and if affords flexibility The Hearing Examiner HE asked what services EES provides and whether our customers were DA customers she was trying to get to our real interest in this case which the PGE attorney helped with later Slocum PGE did not understand that our proposal was only for TOU customerrs and asked a lot of questions about implementation problems that were based on implementation for all classesQuestions like moving usage data to billing system turnover in customers lack of data for new customers lack of metering Harry acknowledged that the peak defined by DJ might not match the rate class peak definition and that some adjustments might have to be made Slocum noted that TOU meters do not show hourly usage and that hourly interval meters would need to be installed to make o ur proposal work Harry answered that we recognize that our proposal would ta ke time but that we need to move to this and that customers need price signal s this summer Our proposal is only for TOU customers and for those for whom it cannot be implemented an equal cents per kwh is appropriate Harry noted that we have not taken a position on the proposal that should be adopted for other customer classes yet He was asked where the came from ands he pointed out the derivation th at was in his testimony based on predicted market price and cost of retained generation Two assumptions were made a average market price and customers have same billing determinants for in combination with marke t price assumptions and existing generation rate to get the revenue requirements It is possible that the price may not be and our revenu e requirements may be off but this is true with every other proposal as well The basis for the is the COB and PV Nymex contracts If our proposal cannot be implemented this summer the cent charge sends an adequate and strong signal to consumers across the board When asked wheth er PGE would have to program a different method for TOU customers if Enron s proposal is adopted Harry answered that they already have to program a different method for TOU customers under existing rates PGE asked how th e decremental reward program would be funded Harry noted that it could be funded through the ISO DWR utility bonding The PGE attorney noted that the utilities have been downgraded to junk bond status and couldnt issu e bonds Funding is an issue Then PGE asked if we left the market on Harry answered no We simply began sourcing power from the utility but our contracts are still i n effect She asked Harry what kind of customers we had were they mostly large TOU customers Do they have interval meters She asked if we were o n the hook for the difference between the bundled rate and the contract rate Harry answered that he didnt know on balance what impact our proposal w ould have on our TOU customers Our proposal helps to foster the goals and pursue the incentives to get to the needed solutions in CA He also noted that all parties to this proceeding were proposing methodologies that were most beneficial to them SCE asked a bunch of questions about recovery of TD costs if the target were used Harry answered that any undercollections that may result and this could be true under any of the proposals could be dealt with it a rate case filing They also talked about how the customer would know the daily prices would the utility be obligated to make that info available HK answered that it is forecast a day ahead and is publicly available Then h e was asked whether Enron would fund the decremental reward program Harry noted that we might under the right conditions but this was outside his expertise ORA asked about weather normalization again under the misapprehension that our proposal applied to weather sensitive smaller customers Harry also to ld him that the indices we proposed were very liquid He also handled questio ns on whether a different average price would yield a different break point a nd we need to provide calculations that show an average price of and The Hearing Examiner then asked for Enrons estimates of summer on peak and off peak prices and ruled that we must supply that info by COB Monday ove r counsels objections In general I think there was a lot of confusion about our proposal not understanding that it was only directed to one type of customer There is also a lot of distrust of Enron and I would add dislike as well I do not think the HE will consider any of our proposals seriously and in fact our support on some of the other proposals could be the kiss of death I would keep our brief very short and very limited as we can weigh in on support of the other A and RD methodologies after the HE issues her recommended decision In fact we might even like a proposal she recommends
