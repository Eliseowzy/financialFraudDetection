November In the letter the Fish and Game agreed EOTT has Acres of conservation credits based on Arco Western Energys sale of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant and premises to Koch Oil and Gas and Kochs subsequent sale of the plant and premises to EOTT ENERGY In the letter the following limitations and clarifications were listed Because the conservation credits may be used for mitigation of EOTT impacts or sold by EOTT to third parties for their own mitigation needs EOTT must affirm that it will conform to the Departments standards for sale of conservation credits as well as management of the credit lands These obligations are already implied by the chain of Kochs and then EOTTs acquisitions of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant EOTT and Department representatives will need to meet to discuss these details and determine the most efficient means to implement these conditions Key provision of the obligations that attend using the conservation credits include Department approval of thirdparty sales minimum endowment requirements for all credit sales management and monitoring of habitat conditions and additional mitigation for disturbance to dedicated habitat Habitat continuity and small animal movement between the North Coles fractionator plant site and the remainder of Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve must be provided in order to maintain viability of the habitat within EOTTs holdings Although it appears we do have the credits for NCL I do not know if Gary ever met with the Fish and Game to discuss the details or means to implement the conditions for use of the conservation credits With the project set to start we may have to purchase the acres of credit from Area John NRON To Kenny ott Scott ott cc AM LarryCampbell OTTCOM RichJolly OTTCOM Lawrence ott

expeditiously in the purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service Service in there approval letter This in indeed good news and EOTT must move ahead to fulfill its

possible It is also my understanding from what research I have been able to do that EOTT does have approximately to acres of credit at the North Coles Levee Preserve You should verify the exact credit number and furnish the Service with such verification That is acreage EOTT will not have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue John

February from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our project for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank and authorizing the Water Bank to extend their incidental take authority to you and your entire project under their Master Permit This is of course very good news The letter notes however that we still need to purchase compensation acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank Specifically we must do the following contact Cheryl Harding of Kern Water Bank to acquire acres of compensation credits and to get included in their Master Permit and get Cheryl Harding a letter from the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve Mark Poe of Aera stating that we have purchased acres of credits for North Coles Levee or that we have set aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased While I could make these contacts I do not believe that would be wise because as Kenny can attest our past experience has been that whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank it prompts them to automatically get their lawyers involved And our experience has been that this only slows things down or worse My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for proposed contract for acquisition of acres of compensation credits and perperwork to include EOTT and its contractors in their Master Permit She should also be informed that while we have not yet purchased the acres of NCL credits we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as security as allowed under our State Take Permit to cover this amount of acreage Ask whether a copy of this LC will suffice for her purposes or whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new lines it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed Please call me if you have any questions or if you would like otherwise to discuss how to approach this issue Thanks a
