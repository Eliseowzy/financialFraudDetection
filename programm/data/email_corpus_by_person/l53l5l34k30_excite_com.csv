receive the report Parents of year old find cash hidden in his closet Does this headline look familiar Of course it does You most likely have seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program USA This year olds mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her yearold sons closet Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash Five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubberbanded in labeled piles My first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the yearold woman There was over dollars in that bag thats more than my husband earns in a year The woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what shed discovered He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet As it turns out the boy had been sending out via Email on the Internet a type of chainletter to Email addresses that he got off of the Internet Everyday after school for the past months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom I just got the Email one day and I figured what the heck I Sent five dollars to five people for the Reports put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out says the clever yearold The Reports I received for my dollars were fantastic The Email letter listed addresses and contained instructions to send one dollar bill to each of the individuals These individuals would in turn email me the Reports I get junk Email all the time and I really didnt think it was gonna work the boy continues Within the first few days of sending out the Email the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his videogame magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing dollar bills About a week later I rode my bike down to the post office and my box had magazine and about envelopes stuffed in it There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the post office counter I thought I was in trouble or something laughs He goes on I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me Over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the Email The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet I barely had time for my homework He had also been riding his bike to several of the areas banks and exchanging the bills for twenties fifties and hundreds I didnt want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me Surprisingly the boy didnt have any reason to be afraid The reporting news team chainletter the boy was sending out and found that it wasnt a chainletter at all In fact it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws Title Section and or Title Section in the US code also in the code of federal regulations Volume Sections and which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received Every five dollar bill that he received he immediately sent out the report requested This Report made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service Sending a Report requested for a five dollar fee The Reports that you will receive and eventually send out are the power behind the program They include insider tips and techniques for cost effective promotion These Reports are very comprehensive and will allow you to build and promote any business product or service on the Internet You have just read the letter that the yearold was sending out by Email you can do the exact same thing he was doing AVAILABLE REPORTS The reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong It is simply about time Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER NAME ONLY Notes Always send cash US CURRENCY for each Report Checks NOT accepted
