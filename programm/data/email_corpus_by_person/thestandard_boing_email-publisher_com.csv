After keeping coy for weeks Lucent and Alcatel finally confessed that theyve been talking about a merger But in the same breath they said the deal was off And after ATT and Agere already bought their bridesmaid outfits Not hours before the companies bailed out respectable news outlets worldwide ran headlines like Alcatel purchase of Lucent seen near What happened The most common explanation given by anonymous but talkative sources to just about every journalist who asked was that Lucent wanted a merger of equals not a takeover The two sides had made significant progress after a weekend of negotiating at a chateau outside Paris said the Wall Street Journal The New York Times added that the talks extended into the nights over dinner and bottles of excellent wine tough life Alcatel and Lucent appeared to have ironed out every possible merger issue except the composition of the postmerger board of directors Lucent chair Henry Schacht wanted an even split of directors Alcatel wanted to give itself and Lucent So the sticking point for what was to be a billion deal comes down to vanity said The Register adding that Alcatel deserved the upper hand considering the cashcrunching messup on the pavement created by Lucents management Investors gave a cheer as the deal was canceled and shares of both firms rose That reversed the slide of recent weeks as talk increasingly cast Lucent as a sinking ship and Alcatel as a reckless savior said TheStreetcom Telecom competitors probably arent as psyched said CBS MarketWatch since a long AlcatelLucent merger hassle might have given rivals a chance to convert some customers The nonmerger probably wont put the hurt on Alcatel but it doesnt look good for Lucent and its debts predicted the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune Alcatel was by no means the only prospective merger partner Lucent courted explained the Times But it was apparently the only company that expressed a real interest Sorry Agere youd better hope you

slip to the media that Bertelsmann is buying MyPlay for million and the news took off like a pair of honeymoon pajamas But a report in Los Angeles Times makes you wonder whether MyPlay is really marrying up Bertelsmann has big plans for its new division to be launched July and called BeMusic According to outlets BeMusic would include MyPlay CDNow BMG Music Service and eventually Napster if Napster can go legit and Bertelsmann can convert its loan to the company into an ownership stake the New York Times added After leaking the deal to the media Bertelsmann and MyPlay officials went mute apparently saving their sound bites for todays official confab That left most reporters dusting off the wellworn template this is the latest example of to serve as analysis The fillintheblank answer by the way is that the deal is the latest in a string of unions between the major labels and online music companies Newscom however offered the fullest explanation pegging the recent shotgun marriages as examples of the music labels submitordie tactics More critical minds in the startup and analyst community have speculated that the labels deliberately starved the online companies of music to minimize the potential competition wrote Jim Hu and John Borland Then again given the collapse of the Net music market startups and analysts have an ax to grind no And what of MyPlay Most reporters seemed to know little of it other than the vague notion that the million sale price made it a poor mans MPcom Several outlets reported that Bertelsmann had considered buying MPcom but passed because of that deals million price tag Webnoize recalled that a year ago MyPlay too had been in the ninedigit club when it was reportedly in talks to be acquired by Yahoo for million Maybe MyPlay just couldnt cut it in Internet time While the Financial Times quoted its Bertelsmann source as applauding MyPlays proprietary technology the Los Angeles Times pegged it as the companys main problem requiring a glacial minutes or so per song on the average dialup modem to transfer a homes music collection into a locker Even MyPlay threw up its hands according to the LA Times having changed its focus in March away from consumers and into developing online musicdistribution services for other companies If MyPlay is feeling emotionally unavailable thats probably just as well Its new partner isnt one for sharing according to the LA Times On Tuesday Bertelsmann finally agreed listen closely and you can hear its arm being twisted to share some of its million in proceeds from its MPcom

Clippys Comeback Remember that splashy multimilliondollar ad campaign Microsoft rolled out for Office XP in which it claimed that Clippy the annoyingly chirpy office assistant had been booted to the curb Well so much for advertising In what some reporters seemed to find the most significant news coming out of yesterdays XP launch Bill Gates Co announced that Clippy lives in the Office update but only if you want him to Figuring out exactly what kind of person would install Clippy intentionally is a task beyond our capabilities Beyond poking fun at an animated paper clip the voluminous coverage of the products launch was fairly uniform As Joe Wilcox of Newscom pointed out the new features receiving the most attention including what Redmond calls smart tags that access external information from within a document use XML Thats because as Gates told Good Morning America A big theme here is about sharing Another big theme is helping MSs big customers many of whom seem reluctant to shell out the dough for XP when Office seems to do the job just fine make more money by enabling their employees to do more work faster According to Reuters Gates said at the main launch event in New York By making Office just percent better we can save hundreds of millions of hours in the workplace The press wasnt all hearts and flowers Barbara Rose of the Chicago Tribune led with Steve Ballmers comments at the Chicago launch about Microsofts renewed efforts to play nicely with industry partners in the wake of its antitrust suit The industry didnt really rally around to our defense I noticed that We all noticed that Ballmer said Computer Reseller News charged that MS has avoided dealing with any of the licensing questions surrounding the new product Its curious it put it that way since the Los Angeles Times Joseph Menn managed to file an entire story on the new and much grumbledabout licensing plan which charges corporate customers for buying the software plus percent of the full price during each of the next three years Analysts commented almost exclusively on Microsofts uphill struggle to get corporate customers to sign on the dotted line There is no easy compelling core value in upgrading to Office XP Microsoft is fiddling with the deck chairs but the ship runs nicely thank you Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett told Newscom Wed all rather go home and play

Office XP newsarticlehtml Why Not Run Another Online Auction Story How do you get your editor to let you spend hours on the Internet exchanging emails with strangers and futzing around on eBay Convince her that theres a story a big story in the wacky world of online auctions Somehow three Wall Street Journal reporters managed to do just that filing two separate pieces on varying aspects of eauctioning Their findings Cookie jars could sell to dead people according to the Journals Robert J Hughes and Daniel Costello who wrote an entertaining piece about their attempts to sell off items including tickets to the Broadway hit The Producers gone in nine minutes and an Elvis clock that sadly went unclaimed In the second piece reporter Nick Wingfield went to the West Columbia SC warehouse of ReturnBuy Inc to discover the groundbreaking news that big businesses have discovered the Internets biggest flea market There must have been something in the air This mornings news was littered with reports and rehashes of the auction biz An Associated Press story picked up by numerous outlets pegged its report to eBays recent decision to charge subscription fees for software that helps sellers manage auctions Implementation of the subscriptionbased software makes obsolete a different eBaysponsored system many sellers bought a few years ago and this predictably has sellers crying foul Too bad the AP said its the wave of the future citing one Net researcher who noted Theres a limit to good will EBay is hardly alone in starting to charge for things A Reuters report on whats happened to Yahoo since it started charging small listing fees certainly backs that up The portals auction unit reports that the percentage of listed merchandise being sold has skyrocketed as has overall bidding activity even though analysts estimate the site lost percent of its US listings when it introduced the fees They are doing very well it is just that now it is on a much smaller scale Safa Rashtchy an analyst with US Bancorp Piper Jaffray told Reuters They are clearly no threat to eBay The sum total of all this chinstroking The online auction world is healthy but changing and small sellers who were almost universally described as momandpop seem to be losing ground to the big guys What doesnt seem to be changing at all though is the medias penchant for the next big auction This weeks example the worlds oldest hockey stick which Torontos Globe and Mail called a crude length of hickory Owner Gord Sharpe hopes it will sell for million In what is perhaps the most cogent analysis

about an imaginary girl who died Two weeks have passed since the death of the nonexistent Kaycee Nichole Swenson and the torrent of words written about the affair has barely slowed In recent days journalists have been finding new lessons in the aftermath of this convoluted Internet hoax Kaycees tale was widely followed among Web loggers for more than a year When her death was announced on May the bloggers plunged into a frenzy of speculation and investigation MSNBC was among the first of the mainstream outlets to recount the deception and its unraveling The New York Times Katie Hafner turned in what may be the definitive account on May The reporter traveled to Peabody Kan to interview Kaycees creator in her home Hafner noted that the good gray Times itself was taken in by Kaycee last year quoting her in an article on computer use by college students And Hafner elicited from blogger Rogers Cadenhead the perfect quote to describe the whirl of investigation following Kaycees demise It was like a story being reported by locusts They swept in and just pulled facts out of the air Editorializing on the site of NUA Internet Surveys Kathy Foley drew a lesson for Internet businesses from the Kaycee hoax Do not pretend to wouldbe online customers that you are something you are not And the Register of all outlets found hope among the ashes Its Washington reporter Thomas

everybody went high with stories about the AOLMicrosoft talks Theyre off No theyre back on You could find support for any theory you liked amid all the leaking and the spinning The Washington Posts Saturday story said that the talks had broken down on Friday and it outlined some of the possible reasons for the rift The paper cited a theory that the sticking point was Microsofts desire that AOL make its Instant Messaging service compatible with Microsofts Another version claimed that Microsoft wanted AOL to sign an exclusive deal to use its Media Player locking out rival RealNetworks the media solution now used by AOL The Posts reporter was skeptical of both explanations of why the talks tanked Todays stories all noted that the talks had resumed over the weekend The Wall Street Journal explored some of the nuances in the giants relationship with an explanation of how Microsoft is changing what it means to be on the desktop It seems the companys new Windows XP to be released in the fall will boot up initially without the familiar scatter of icons on the desktop Users will be able to add icons according to the Journal but a new program called the sweeper will ask them periodically if they want to remove the less frequently used ones Microsofts detailed control over the users experience prompted AOL to tell lawmakers recently that Windows XP is antiinnovation anticonsumer and anticompetitive according to the Journal Writing in the New York Times John Markoff updated the story with the help of his own anonymous sources who told him that Microsoft had been trying to persuade AOL to agree not to lobby against Microsoft in current or future court battles but that AOL is holding open the possibility of pursuing antitrust action against Microsoft if the talks break down Nonamers inside AOL told Markoff that the media giant has grown increasingly concerned of late over Microsofts DotNet strategy and its plans for Hailstorm a technology intended to aggregate consumers personal information and transactions Markoff concluded with a review of the Internet appliance that AOL had once planned to introduce Markoff quoted another nonamer who said that

branded online service The offering results from a partnership with who else AOL It will be based on the CompuServe online service which has long since been acquired by AOL Bartels reported that it will be priced below per month Bartels questioned the wisdom of introducing a bargain ISP service at this point in the tech slump noting that other experiments to offer free or lowcost Internet service have been largely unsuccessful The reporter quoted a Gartner analyst who questioned the buying power of those consumers that Walmartcom is aiming to reach A WalMart spokesman responded with this spectacularly mixed metaphor We cant back off on growth The balls on our shoulders Wsjcoms Melinda Patterson Grenier compared the planned WalMart Connect service in detail with its rival Kmarts bluelightcom which has offered threetier Internet service since December By some odd coincidence this is the same month that saw the announcement of the WalMartAOL deal Grenier raised more questions

even invoked its sewer utility past Ooh the indignity As for Houghton Mifflin if your response was Houghton who you werent alone Vivendi ponied up billion mostly for Houghtons textbook business but in the publishers hometown of Boston newspapers skipped that angle to focus on Houghtons smaller but historically glam nonfiction division which brought us everyone from Mark Twain to James Carroll to

appealing as airline food Pending approval the online subsidiary of United Airlines will buy MyPoints an incentive marketing company that gives redeemable shopping points to users who jump through hoops such as reading targeted email Seems weird but InternetNewscom suggested the deal makes some sense Like several of its competitors San Franciscobased MyPoints has found airlines and travel companies to be some of the most receptive to its offerings said InternetNewscoms Christopher Saunders noting that MyPoints clients include Continental and Alaskan Airlines Forbescom predicted that large companies desperate to beef up their Internet activities buying promising but beatendown dotcoms will become a trend The New York Times on the other hand pointed out that United is building its Net arm at a time when other companies are closing or reabsorbing their Internet units Forbes added that United opened its online venture a mere seven months ago well thats seven months sooner than WalMart launched its ISP United would pay a share for MyPoints stock a price observers seemed to consider milehigh News of the deal sent shares of MyPoints leaping cents to said CBS MarketWatch It should have the offer comes at a percent premium to Fridays closing price and a whopping percent premium to the stocks week low The New York Times took a good newsbad news approach saying is well below the it sold for in December but quite a lot better than the cents that MyPoints shares hit in March Either way MyPoints is unprofitable and the online advertising market in general has seen better days Forbescom did the best debunking job under the incredulous headline United Airlines Buys Tiny Direct Marketing Firm Reporter Lisa DiCarlo wondered how many of MyPoints million subscribers are active members whether the two companies subscriber lists overlap much and how MyPoints proprietary technology is supposed to work for United Another mystery remains United told InternetNewscom that it is interested in linking MyPoints marketing services with UALs frequentflier club while the New York Times reported that United wont merge its frequentflier program with the MyPoints reward program The typical MyPoints user does not fly often enough to make airline miles valuable to them said the Times But United will offer travel discounts as rewards for MyPoints points Can we apply the

has taken the first step towards legalizing online gambling Like past legislation intended to ban Internet betting in the US and Australia and if youre feeling cynical like any legislation anywhere it has come with political finagling and specialinterest lobbying The federal government considers Net betting illegal and this bill wouldnt change that But Nevadas pending legislation would authorize regulators to license brickandmortar casinos to go online as soon as they can prevent bets from minors or anyone whose home jurisdiction disallows gambling MSNBC gave a good rundown of what that might involve and how long it might take think Nevada casinos wishing to legally offer online bets would have to front a licensing fee every two years Some say the fee would ensure that only reputable companies take bets online others say it would unfairly lock out small operators That would have been like saying five years ago only bricksandmortar bookstores can sell books over the Internet a Nevada state Senator Terry Care told the New York Times He has a point but then again there isnt much of a market in offshore ripoff paperbacks The Las Vegas ReviewJournal explained the local saga behind gambling legislation An original online gambling bill died in the Senate amid nebulous political goingson It was revived as an addon to a different bill about work cards for casino employees If the online bit is an amendment a notoriously antigambling state senator wouldnt be able to pull the usual maneuver amending any gambling bill with a substantial tax increase because the bill would already have an amendment The Vegas papers as an aside consistently refer to the gaming not gambling industry Several outlets noticed that Las Vegas casinos have reversed their stance on Internet betting But as theyve watched online casinos rake in cash from people who never need to leave their computers to make a bet several companies have changed their minds and are pushing for a regulated

supposedly valuable Napster brand but The Register argued Say Napster to someone and the first reaction will most likely be failure Either that or pig Latin Since Napster nailed down its filtering technique theres no arguing that its membership has dropped But by how much The New York Times reported on Napsters more than million users maybe that refers to anyone who has ever tried the service a MusicNet adviser elsewhere mentioned million music fans and a Webnoize report that measured only simultaneous users counted a drop from million to Users are still there insisted a Webnoize analyst

conglomerates he controls the billionaire pegged by Reuters as Hong Kongs richest man now owns percent of the former Net darling He also now controls three of Pricelines board seats the Financial

unclear on what will become of them The Associated Press reported that Priceline said Walker has sold the shares or plans to The Financial Times countered that Walkers remaining stake is subject to complications such as options forward contracts or other private agreements with investors So the sale to Li Kashing effectively reduces Walkers stake to nothing as the peach paper put it Doesnt it look bad when a company founder cashes out Not to a Priceline spokesman who gamely spun the deal as a positive one that increases the involvement of two strategic partners Reuters reported The wire

fanfare But after most of the hype disappeared opinions differed on whether the site would ever earn its wings Most recently Thursdays Wall Street Journal ran an article about the problems Orbitz had in its first few days off the ground A fiberoptic cable was severed in Orbitzs home city of Chicago slowing response times for three hours Call centers in Florida were swamped Then Orbitz took the site down for an upgrade early Wednesday and neglected to put up a placeholder And this is after Orbitz delayed its launch by months to perfect its service and product offering the Journal wrote Washington Post columnist Keith Alexander tested a few sample routes and Orbitz competitor Travelocity found the cheapest fare two times out of three WebTravelNewscom reported that the investment bank Pacific Crest did a more formal pricing audit and found that Orbitz ranked last compared to Expedia and Travelocity when it came to price Orbitz seems to prefer the results from Arthur Andersens study which said Orbitz meets or beats its competitors low fares in more than four out of five instances The Associated Press took Orbitz down another peg when it observed that Orbitz is not the first online travel site to offer consumers the special fares airlines once sold only on their own Web sites A California company called SideStep has done something similar since November The Post agreed that Orbitz is not an original concept Even Manitowoc Wisconsins Herald Times Reporter dismissed Orbitz albeit from a bricksandmortar angle The launch of the new Orbitz Web site by five major airlines probably wont have a major impact on travel agencies said the article The owner of the local business Davids House of Travel wasnt worried since she assumed Orbitz would split existing Internet customers with Travelocity and Expedia Happily for Orbitz Reuters cut the company some slack in an article that took its cue from an Orbitz press release Because of the chaos the Journal wrote about

people to go one way or another If you can stand any more talk about this subject in other words our British readers are excused now there are plenty of philosophical pieces on the nature of digital

ExciteAtHome fessed up that its technoliberation plans on the Continent were kaput The only surprise to most outlets was what took it so long According to reporters Excite is saying adieu auf wiedersehn and adios to its operations in France Germany and Spain and it will close another half dozen Euro portals Its also axing jobs Excite blamed the closings on what else the decline in online advertising It was reported to have been shopping itself around since April The Register reminded readers that just two months ago the Euro divisions managing director told the Financial Times that the company would rather sell the business for than withdraw from Europe after all the time and money we have invested Before you rustle around your pocket for the change Reuters and the Associated Press noted that the closings came just one day after Excite said it was in talks about restructuring its commercial relationship with Comcast and Cox Communications Thats Internet time for you The London Times tipped its hat to Excite as one of the bestknown Net brands in Europe but one analyst told the Wall Street Journal that the Euro Net scene had been waiting to see some of the alsoran

Outpostcom were aired during the Super Bowl That was not the case Also we misattributed a quote by a PC Connection spokesman to that companys CEO We regret the errors TOP GROKS Juno and NetZero A Skeptics Field Day Unfortunately for Juno and NetZero the press seemed to use news of the free ISPs planned merger as a refresher course in being skeptical with virtually all outlets expressing doubt about the combined companys prospects for success Witness TheStreetcoms George Mannes Divided theyd fall Now the question is whether united theyll stand And thats one of the nicer characterizations Reporters had no trouble rounding up analysts and other observers to suggest that the deal which would make United Online as the new company will be called second only to America Online in subscribers wont ultimately have much effect on the companies sagging fortunes Heck even NetZero CEO Mark Goldston who will head the new company said the free ISP idea isnt all it was once cracked up to be telling the San Jose Mercury News The free model absolutely works when you put usage limits on it Free doesnt work when you dont have the capital and you cant wait out the advertising downturn The Wall Street Journal talked to Earthlink president Michael S McQuary who didnt miss a chance to get a jab in at the competition When you add more weight to a sinking ship it just sinks faster A few outlets mentioned that the merger will put an end to the quarreling thats been going on between Juno and NetZero for the last year or so others focused on the companies furious struggles to convert free users into paid Under the new agreement free service will be offered under the NetZero name while those lucrative paid subscribers currently only million of the companies million customers as outlets were happy to point out will belong to the Juno brand name Griped one analyst to the LA Times Theyll just lose money cooperatively Though the million agreement between the companies was widely described as a merger that term as usual has a very flexible definition NetZero stockholders would own about percent of the company and Juno president Charles Ardai would slip off to sunnier climes while NetZeros Goldston takes over once the deal is completed later this year As for United Onlines prospects the folks at SatireWire weighed in running a short piece with the headline Juno NetZero

briefsnetzeroshtml Microsoft Supplies the Missing Links Microsoft celebrated the oneyear anniversary of a federal judges order to break up the company by stirring a fresh firestorm of media criticism over a new feature that enables its browser to add links to other publishers Web sites The feature Smart Tags shows up on the browser and on some Office applications in test versions of Microsofts Windows XP operating system set to be released on Oct When a page loads into Microsofts Internet Explorer the browser can identify words in the text and attach links to Microsofts own sites or sites Redmond is friendly with Newscoms Joe Wilcox reported the feature on Wednesday describing it primarily as a way to build links from applications such as Microsofts Excel spreadsheets to Microsofts Web services Ticker symbols in a spreadsheet could link to company information on Microsofts MSN MoneyCentral site Wilcox quoted analysts who wrung their hands over the prospect of Microsoft hijacking visitors to its own sites Wouldnt that be something Gartner analyst Michael Silver said You spend millions of dollars designing a Web site and Microsoft has a Smart Tag that sends users to one of Microsofts own sites Grok wonders if Judge Jackson would find that to be something On Thursday Wall Street Journal columnist Walter Mossberg turned up the heat calling Smart Tags something new and dangerous A Microsoft official had the gall to tell Mossberg the feature will spare users from underlinked sites Supposedly the feature will come turned off by default in new browsers and Web site publishers will be able to add a tag to their pages to block the feature If the feature is so benign Mossberg writes why is Microsoft hiding it and offering sites a way to block it By Thursday afternoon the war drums were pounding On Slashdot notice of the tags drew predictably several hundred damning comments from Redmondbaiters and hoots of chortling cynical laughter at Michael Silvers comment on Newscom that I dont think theres any nefarious plot Nick Wingfields report in Fridays Wall Street Journal quoted UserLand Software chief executive and sometimes Microsoft critic Dave Winer

You to Go Today articlesshtml Everythings Coming Up Semiconductors Maybe its the approach of the weekend or the nearness of summer but all it takes are a few words from Intel and the bulls are on the loose In its firstever midquarter conference call thanks to those pesky SEC regulations that make companies share their secrets with all investors not just selected analysts Intel said things arent really as bad as they seem As Bloomberg put it the largest chipmaker said secondquarter sales will be at the lower end of its estimates surprising investors who had expected less In a conference call variously described as positive upbeat and relatively good Intel execs expounded on the wonders of what they said is a rebounding PC market Analysts and reporters for that matter would love for that to be true one analyst told Bloomberg This is almost like a status quo announcement and these days thats mildly positive TheStreetcom mentioned however that the company is a bit of a lone voice in the personal computer sector right now since other manufacturers are still saying the market is weak Andy Bryant Intel CFO did acknowledge that the communicationschip part of Intels business is still lousy and getting worse though he added that the second half of the year should be better as regular seasonal ordering patterns pick up Not so fast cautioned the Financial Times Last year the traditionally strong second half for Intel did not materialize Also a large part of its revenues are usually booked in the final few weeks of its quarter which makes it more difficult for the company to know at the midquarter if it will meet its prior expectations Even National Semiconductors news that it expects a deep loss and a further decline in sales in the current quarter according the Wall Street Journal didnt dampen anyones spirits Nat Semi as the Journal chummily called it did manage to beat its own lowered earnings expectations and the San Jose Mercury News reported that CEO Brian Halla offered a slight glimmer of hope for the downtrodden communications sector These days it seems thats enough to make a bull out of the gloomiest investor Michaela Cavallaro Bad is good

products making Bill Gates a popular cover boy for Fortune and Business Week The only thing missing from their reviews of his companys elaborate plans is scrutiny Just about any software application

well in its humble home IPO ripoff stories are everywhere these days as federal and state agencies pick up the pace on investigating them but its not just the investment bankers who are finding

fact that its sticking by its official prediction of between percent and percent revenue growth going forward is encouraging Inventories Are Fat But Not Happy Everyones got more of Ciscos products than they need That goes for its customers and Ciscos own inventory levels Then there are those holdings In Q the company lost billion in last years Q it gained billion If as Cisco says its holdings resemble the Nasdaq and if the market continues to deteriorate Cisco will take a double hit Do You Believe If you told me last year that youd sell me your shares of Cisco for I would have bought all I
