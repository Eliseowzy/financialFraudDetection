<5891443.1075847641832.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,david.parquet@enron.com,2001-01-30 02:44:00,Re Urgent Steve Kean to testify at Senate hearing need infomore item e Suspend or relax the RACT Reasonably Available Control Technology adjustment requirements to promote the creation of cleaner air and ERCs Example When we were having difficulty in finding ERCs for Pastoria we realized that there were quite a few operating gas turbine projects in Kern County We developed an agreement with GE because the projects all had GE turbines and GE serviced them to approach the owners of the projects and offer to retrofit new emissions reduction technology in exchange for an attractive business deal The appropriate technology is Dry Low NOX DLN which reduces NOX emissions from permitted levels of ppm to ppm To our surprise since these reductions are RACT per present Clean Air Rules we can get credit only for reductions below ppm Maybe that is intellectually OK but the shocker is that there is now in Kern County no requirement to reduce emissions to RACT standards So they keep polluting at ppm We have the same concern with the cement plant initiative we are taking mentioned in item d We are working with the largest single source of pollution in the SF Bay Area to retrofit it with SCRs which if successful will reduce emissions by tons per year enough for at least a MW plant However there is a plant in Germany just starting up with SCRs We are concerned that air officials here will become aware of that plant and RACT adjust any emissions reductions we may get I will tell you if that happens the plant will not make the retrofit as the economics simply do not work and they will continue to pollute You can mention in public the Kern County example but please do not breathe a word about the cement plant initiative Forwarded by David ParquetSFECT on AM David Parquet PM To Elizabeth NRON cc Alan CT James D nron Jeff nron John NeslageENRON NRON NRON Margaret NRON Mary nron Richard

Steves point on siting new power plants I ASSUME SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE IS THE FEDERAL SENATE NOT THE STATE SENATE I HAVE GEARED MY SUGGESTIONS TO THINGS THE FEDS CAN OR SHOULD DO THE PREAMBLE The continuing lack of leadership by the Governor is causing serious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to make the billions in investments required for new power plants The desparate search for blame placing of exactly the guys that would make the investment the lawsuits the simplistic outright misrepresentations of what happened and is happening the threats of condemnation etc are doing a good job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the market that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in power plants in the states history To the point the debt lenders are getting nervous the equity providors are getting nervous Duke I would have less third world risk developing a plant in Brazil If the final result of all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid and the buying and selling of power the cynic might observe that we will have traded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion to the old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases In my opinion there is no way that the governors present political initiatives will result in the number of power plants that are necessary to cover the demand He may be covering the near term pricesupply issues with his CDWR initiative I note that it is winter time and power demand is down notwithstanding stage alerts wait until summer peak demands but destroyed the desire of the long term risk takers to develop new plants in this market If the politicians think the state can do the development I dont think so Think about it there just is not anyone in the IOUs or CDWR or the Munis or any state agency that can make the decisions necessary to make the investments required IN A TIMELY MANNER The public entities do not even have the staffs to do the required work much less the political environment to get anything done given the continued thirst for doing things right vs doing the right thing Maybe we will get back to long term power purchase agreements for the development of new power plants I point out that the Standard Offer contracts developed by the State and entered into YEARS AGO in a regulated environment by nearly MW of QFs are STILL OUT OF THE MONEY Per SCE since the PX began in only during August and December of last year were they in the money We checked it out they are right That is astounding And we want to go back to that Enron would be pleased to participate in long term PPAs especially since we are developing several sites and can make money doing that But if we want to be statesmen about this we need must get a market paradigm back THE SUGGESTIONS Federal Environmental issues There are agencies in CA that get involved in air issues US EPA CEC CARB and the local AQMD Lots of rhetoric that each is just doing its own job but the de facto result of that many agencies looking at the inevitably overlapping issues is that the requirements end up much tougher than they need to be Letting the state deal with the last and focusing on the US EPA because of where Steve will be testifying seems like the US EPA probably through a change in law at the Federal level could do the following a Take a leadership position in rationalizing the rat warren of districts and basins and ERC creation and transfer restrictions To our utter amazement every little district that we have gone into to develop power plants have completely different rules and have required a completely different approach re ERCs SF Bay Area South Coast San Joaquin County Kern County Placer etc ERCs are the single biggest problem we have in moving forward on the development of over MW of new plants we have on the books I point out the ERC market in the east for SOX SOX ERCs produced in Ohio can be used in a new plant in Indiana This is not technically crisp but was a rational political decision as part of the Clean Air Act We need that same rationalization now in California Granted CA and its politics was probably the genesis of the arbitrariness of AQMD vs county boundaries vs basin boundaries but if we can get the state to the table to change this the EPA will be involved Leadership by all is necessary When ppm new plants are being held up the ppm plants will continue to be used to produce the power Do the math and tell me if the pollution produced during the period of delay is worth the result Do it again realizing that many of these ppm plants will never be developed given the difficulty b Consider impact fees the concept of pay to pollute In LA there are car pool requirements to reduce pollution If a company cannot or will not carpool sufficiently they can pay a fine that the district applies I think to general programs like electric water heaters vs gas electric lawn mowers vs gasoline mass transit etc Implement a similar program for power plants Work in concert with the local air district and the EPA to develop a program that allows the developer to pay the market price for credits FYI million for Pastoria which the district uses to develop credits from existing sources that have not yet been cleaned up see list lines above and others Necessity power plant proceeds while credits are being develop If it takes years to develop the credits consider issues and value of fact that the ppm plant will eventually replace the ppm plants c Stop the crusade for ever lower BACT requirements that are based on vague representations inconclusive data and over zealous developer agreements Example Several years ago Goalline Technologies developed SCONOX for NOX reduction in a MW unit in LA Good thing to do but based primarily on the results of that small unit and the salesmanship of Goallines president we got ratcheted down on our MW plant in Pittsburg to ppm SCAQMD calls to SCR vendors indicated we can do that EPA jumped on board Guarantees from EPC contractors with LDs for nonperformance are different than we can do that from an equipment supplier Now EPA and others are wanting ppm again based on vague data Sam even advises requests to consider ppm I point out that there are ZERO frame Fa units in operation at these levels in California GE has told us absolutely not to a ppm guarantee However I believe that requirements will in fact be reduced again by EPA just because they can Again do the math on delaying or stopping the development of say a ppm plant because EPA wants ppm in favor of the continued operation of a ppm plant Hugely more resultant pollution d Be open minded and proactive with developers novel methods of creating new sources of ERCs PGE had a heck of a time creating ERCs for their Otay Mesa MW power plant in San Diego ending up putting new engines in harbor boats and garbage trucks Enron has several similarly dificult initiatives underway Steve cannot tell anyone this FYI only we are looking at replacing engines in harbor boats in SF Bay replacing engines in yard locomotives in Sacramento and LA replacing agricultural pumping engines in the Central Valley putting SCR technology in cement plants all over CA We could take years to get these programs approved as did PGE or we can take several months with EPAs and others leadership Federal Siting Issues California is at least attempting through legislation to speed up the siting on new power plants Unfortunately the Federal agencies do not have the time line requirements to provide their review on the speeded up schedules For example a request of the Fish and Wildlife Department for a reviewpermit gets put on the priority pile first come first serve shopping centers housing developments power plants power lines etc I understand that our Pastoria project had FW applications ahead of it when we applied And there was no limitation on how long they could take to get the review done I understand that one power project has waited years for its review The only way we got our permit was Sam Wehn begged FW to figure a way to get it done ahead of the other applications Fortunately FW figured that we could reapply under an EPA rule in this specific case which did have a timeline limitation We should not have to rely on luck to get plants permitted Suggestion require the federal agencies involved in power plant or transmission line permitting to speed up their reviewpermitting times to be consistent with the state initiatives to speed things up Market Issues I will not go into this in detail as Steve is more able than I to vocalize these issues However from a power plant development point of view if we want the private sector

Available Control Technology adjustment requirements to promote the creation of cleaner air and ERCs Example When we were having difficulty in finding ERCs for Pastoria we realized that there were quite a few operating gas turbine projects in Kern County We developed an agreement with GE because the projects all had GE turbines and GE serviced them to approach the owners of the projects and offer to retrofit new emissions reduction technology in exchange for an attractive business deal The appropriate technology is Dry Low NOX DLN which reduces NOX emissions from permitted levels of ppm to ppm To our surprise since these reductions are RACT per present Clean Air Rules we can get credit only for reductions below ppm Maybe that is intellectually OK but the shocker is that there is now in Kern County no requirement to reduce emissions to RACT standards So they keep polluting at ppm We have the same concern with the cement plant initiative we are taking mentioned in item d We are working with the largest single source of pollution in the SF Bay Area to retrofit it with SCRs which if successful will reduce emissions by tons per year enough for at least a MW plant However there is a plant in Germany just starting up with SCRs We are concerned that air officials here will become aware of that plant and RACT adjust any emissions reductions we may get I will tell you if that happens the plant will not make the retrofit as the economics simply do not work and they will continue to pollute You can mention in public the Kern County example but please do not breathe a word about the cement plant initiative Forwarded by David ParquetSFECT on AM David Parquet PM To Elizabeth NRON cc Alan CT James D nron Jeff nron John NeslageENRON NRON NRON Margaret NRON Mary nron Richard B CT Sandra NRON Steve CT Steven J nron Susan J NRON Subject Re Urgent Steve Kean to testify at Senate hearing need info I have little that Steve does not probably know by heart But a few comments to Steves point on siting new power plants I ASSUME SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE IS THE FEDERAL SENATE NOT THE STATE SENATE I HAVE GEARED MY SUGGESTIONS TO THINGS THE FEDS CAN OR SHOULD DO THE PREAMBLE The continuing lack of leadership by the Governor is causing serious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to make the billions in investments required for new power plants The desparate search for blame placing of exactly the guys that would make the investment the lawsuits the simplistic outright misrepresentations of what happened and is happening the threats of condemnation etc are doing a good job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the market that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in power plants in the states history To the point the debt lenders are getting nervous the equity providors are getting nervous Duke I would have less third world risk developing a plant in Brazil If the final result of all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid and the buying and selling of power the cynic might observe that we will have traded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion to the old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases In my opinion there is no way that the governors present political initiatives will result in the number of power plants that are necessary to cover the demand He may be covering the near term pricesupply issues with his CDWR initiative I note that it is winter time and power demand is down notwithstanding stage alerts wait until summer peak demands but destroyed the desire of the long term risk takers to develop new plants in this market If the politicians think the state can do the development I dont think so Think about it there just is not anyone in the IOUs or CDWR or the Munis or any state agency that can make the decisions necessary to make the investments required IN A TIMELY MANNER The public entities do not even have the staffs to do the required work much less the political environment to get anything done given the continued thirst for doing things right vs doing the right thing Maybe we will get back to long term power purchase agreements for the development of new power plants I point out that the Standard Offer contracts developed by the State and entered into YEARS AGO in a regulated environment by nearly MW of QFs are STILL OUT OF THE MONEY Per SCE since the PX began in only during August and December of last year were they in the money We checked it out they are right That is astounding And we want to go back to that Enron would be pleased to participate in long term PPAs especially since we are developing several sites and can make money doing that But if we want to be statesmen about this we need must get a market paradigm back THE SUGGESTIONS Federal Environmental issues There are agencies in CA that get involved in air issues US EPA CEC CARB and the local AQMD Lots of rhetoric that each is just doing its own job but the de facto result of that many agencies looking at the inevitably overlapping issues is that the requirements end up much tougher than they need to be Letting the state deal with the last and focusing on the US EPA because of where Steve will be testifying seems like the US EPA probably through a change in law at the Federal level could do the following a Take a leadership position in rationalizing the rat warren of districts and basins and ERC creation and transfer restrictions To our utter amazement every little district that we have gone into to develop power plants have completely different rules and have required a completely different approach re ERCs SF Bay Area South Coast San Joaquin County Kern County Placer etc ERCs are the single biggest problem we have in moving forward on the development of over MW of new plants we have on the books I point out the ERC market in the east for SOX SOX ERCs produced in Ohio can be used in a new plant in Indiana This is not technically crisp but was a rational political decision as part of the Clean Air Act We need that same rationalization now in California Granted CA and its politics was probably the genesis of the arbitrariness of AQMD vs county boundaries vs basin boundaries but if we can get the state to the table to change this the EPA will be involved Leadership by all is necessary When ppm new plants are being held up the ppm plants will continue to be used to produce the power Do the math and tell me if the pollution produced during the period of delay is worth the result Do it again realizing that many of these ppm plants will never be developed given the difficulty b Consider impact fees the concept of pay to pollute In LA there are car pool requirements to reduce pollution If a company cannot or will not carpool sufficiently they can pay a fine that the district applies I think to general programs like electric water heaters vs gas electric lawn mowers vs gasoline mass transit etc Implement a similar program for power plants Work in concert with the local air district and the EPA to develop a program that allows the developer to pay the market price for credits FYI million for Pastoria which the district uses to develop credits from existing sources that have not yet been cleaned up see list lines above and others Necessity power plant proceeds while credits are being develop If it takes years to develop the credits consider issues and value of fact that the ppm plant will eventually replace the ppm plants c Stop the crusade for ever lower BACT requirements that are based on vague representations inconclusive data and over zealous developer agreements Example Several years ago Goalline Technologies developed SCONOX for NOX reduction in a MW unit in LA Good thing to do but based primarily on the results of that small unit and the salesmanship of Goallines president we got ratcheted down on our MW plant in Pittsburg to ppm SCAQMD calls to SCR vendors indicated we can do that EPA jumped on board Guarantees from EPC contractors with LDs for nonperformance are different than we can do that from an equipment supplier Now EPA and others are wanting ppm again based on vague data Sam even advises requests to consider ppm I point out that there are ZERO frame Fa units in operation at these levels in California GE has told us absolutely not to a ppm guarantee However I believe that requirements will in fact be reduced again by EPA just because they can Again do the math on delaying or stopping the development of say a ppm plant because EPA wants ppm in favor of the continued operation of a ppm plant Hugely more resultant pollution d Be open minded and proactive with developers novel methods of creating new sources of ERCs PGE had a heck of a time creating ERCs for their Otay Mesa MW power plant in San Diego ending up putting new engines in harbor boats and garbage trucks Enron has several similarly dificult initiatives underway Steve cannot tell anyone this FYI only we are looking at replacing engines in harbor boats in SF Bay replacing engines in yard locomotives in Sacramento and LA replacing agricultural pumping engines in the Central Valley putting SCR technology in cement plants all over CA We could take years to get these programs approved as did PGE or we can take several months with EPAs and others leadership Federal Siting Issues California is at least attempting through legislation to speed up the siting on new power plants Unfortunately the Federal agencies do not have the time line requirements to provide their review on the speeded up schedules For example a request of the Fish and Wildlife Department for a reviewpermit gets put on the priority pile first come first serve shopping centers housing developments power plants power lines etc I understand that our Pastoria project had FW applications ahead of it when we applied And there was no limitation on how long they could take to get the review done I understand that one power project has waited years for its review The only way we got our permit was Sam Wehn begged FW to figure a way to get it done ahead of the other applications Fortunately FW figured that we could reapply under an EPA rule in this specific case which did have a timeline limitation We should not have to rely on luck to get plants permitted Suggestion require the federal agencies involved in power plant or transmission line permitting to speed up their reviewpermitting times to be consistent with the state initiatives to speed things up Market Issues I will not go into this in detail as Steve is more able than I to vocalize these issues However from a power plant development point of view if we want the private sector

heart But a few comments to Steves point on siting new power plants I ASSUME SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE IS THE FEDERAL SENATE NOT THE STATE SENATE I HAVE GEARED MY SUGGESTIONS TO THINGS THE FEDS CAN OR SHOULD DO THE PREAMBLE The continuing lack of leadership by the Governor is causing serious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to make the billions in investments required for new power plants The desparate search for blame placing of exactly the guys that would make the investment the lawsuits the simplistic outright misrepresentations of what happened and is happening the threats of condemnation etc are doing a good job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the market that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in power plants in the states history To the point the debt lenders are getting nervous the equity providors are getting nervous Duke I would have less third world risk developing a plant in Brazil If the final result of all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid and the buying and selling of power the cynic might observe that we will have traded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion to the old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases In my opinion there is no way that the governors present political initiatives will result in the number of power plants that are necessary to cover the demand He may be covering the near term pricesupply issues with his CDWR initiative I note that it is winter time and power demand is down notwithstanding stage alerts wait until summer peak demands but destroyed the desire of the long term risk takers to develop new plants in this market If the politicians think the state can do the development I dont think so Think about it there just is not anyone in the IOUs or CDWR or the Munis or any state agency that can make the decisions necessary to make the investments required IN A TIMELY MANNER The public entities do not even have the staffs to do the required work much less the political environment to get anything done given the continued thirst for doing things right vs doing the right thing Maybe we will get back to long term power purchase agreements for the development of new power plants I point out that the Standard Offer contracts developed by the State and entered into YEARS AGO in a regulated environment by nearly MW of QFs are STILL OUT OF THE MONEY Per SCE since the PX began in only during August and December of last year were they in the money We checked it out they are right That is astounding And we want to go back to that Enron would be pleased to participate in long term PPAs especially since we are developing several sites and can make money doing that But if we want to be statesmen about this we need must get a market paradigm back THE SUGGESTIONS Federal Environmental issues There are agencies in CA that get involved in air issues US EPA CEC CARB and the local AQMD Lots of rhetoric that each is just doing its own job but the de facto result of that many agencies looking at the inevitably overlapping issues is that the requirements end up much tougher than they need to be Letting the state deal with the last and focusing on the US EPA because of where Steve will be testifying seems like the US EPA probably through a change in law at the Federal level could do the following a Take a leadership position in rationalizing the rat warren of districts and basins and ERC creation and transfer restrictions To our utter amazement every little district that we have gone into to develop power plants have completely different rules and have required a completely different approach re ERCs SF Bay Area South Coast San Joaquin County Kern County Placer etc ERCs are the single biggest problem we have in moving forward on the development of over MW of new plants we have on the books I point out the ERC market in the east for SOX SOX ERCs produced in Ohio can be used in a new plant in Indiana This is not technically crisp but was a rational political decision as part of the Clean Air Act We need that same rationalization now in California Granted CA and its politics was probably the genesis of the arbitrariness of AQMD vs county boundaries vs basin boundaries but if we can get the state to the table to change this the EPA will be involved Leadership by all is necessary When ppm new plants are being held up the ppm plants will continue to be used to produce the power Do the math and tell me if the pollution produced during the period of delay is worth the result Do it again realizing that many of these ppm plants will never be developed given the difficulty b Consider impact fees the concept of pay to pollute In LA there are car pool requirements to reduce pollution If a company cannot or will not carpool sufficiently they can pay a fine that the district applies I think to general programs like electric water heaters vs gas electric lawn mowers vs gasoline mass transit etc Implement a similar program for power plants Work in concert with the local air district and the EPA to develop a program that allows the developer to pay the market price for credits FYI million for Pastoria which the district uses to develop credits from existing sources that have not yet been cleaned up see list lines above and others Necessity power plant proceeds while credits are being develop If it takes years to develop the credits consider issues and value of fact that the ppm plant will eventually replace the ppm plants c Stop the crusade for ever lower BACT requirements that are based on vague representations inconclusive data and over zealous developer agreements Example Several years ago Goalline Technologies developed SCONOX for NOX reduction in a MW unit in LA Good thing to do but based primarily on the results of that small unit and the salesmanship of Goallines president we got ratcheted down on our MW plant in Pittsburg to ppm SCAQMD calls to SCR vendors indicated we can do that EPA jumped on board Guarantees from EPC contractors with LDs for nonperformance are different than we can do that from an equipment supplier Now EPA and others are wanting ppm again based on vague data Sam even advises requests to consider ppm I point out that there are ZERO frame Fa units in operation at these levels in California GE has told us absolutely not to a ppm guarantee However I believe that requirements will in fact be reduced again by EPA just because they can Again do the math on delaying or stopping the development of say a ppm plant because EPA wants ppm in favor of the continued operation of a ppm plant Hugely more resultant pollution d Be open minded and proactive with developers novel methods of creating new sources of ERCs PGE had a heck of a time creating ERCs for their Otay Mesa MW power plant in San Diego ending up putting new engines in harbor boats and garbage trucks Enron has several similarly dificult initiatives underway Steve cannot tell anyone this FYI only we are looking at replacing engines in harbor boats in SF Bay replacing engines in yard locomotives in Sacramento and LA replacing agricultural pumping engines in the Central Valley putting SCR technology in cement plants all over CA We could take years to get these programs approved as did PGE or we can take several months with EPAs and others leadership Federal Siting Issues California is at least attempting through legislation to speed up the siting on new power plants Unfortunately the Federal agencies do not have the time line requirements to provide their review on the speeded up schedules For example a request of the Fish and Wildlife Department for a reviewpermit gets put on the priority pile first come first serve shopping centers housing developments power plants power lines etc I understand that our Pastoria project had FW applications ahead of it when we applied And there was no limitation on how long they could take to get the review done I understand that one power project has waited years for its review The only way we got our permit was Sam Wehn begged FW to figure a way to get it done ahead of the other applications Fortunately FW figured that we could reapply under an EPA rule in this specific case which did have a timeline limitation We should not have to rely on luck to get plants permitted Suggestion require the federal agencies involved in power plant or transmission line permitting to speed up their reviewpermitting times to be consistent with the state initiatives to speed things up Market Issues I will not go into this in detail as Steve is more able than I to vocalize these issues However from a power plant development point of view if we want the private sector to develop MERCHANT power plants and I believe we do because of the enormity of the investment required we must get back to a market structure As I am sure Steve remembers one of the big issues we all dealt with in deregulation was stranded cost We can avoid those issues by getting the private sector to make the investments Steve knows all the issues stability liquidity

Available Control Technology adjustment requirements to promote the creation of cleaner air and ERCs Example When we were having difficulty in finding ERCs for Pastoria we realized that there were quite a few operating gas turbine projects in Kern County We developed an agreement with GE because the projects all had GE turbines and GE serviced them to approach the owners of the projects and offer to retrofit new emissions reduction technology in exchange for an attractive business deal The appropriate technology is Dry Low NOX DLN which reduces NOX emissions from permitted levels of ppm to ppm To our surprise since these reductions are RACT per present Clean Air Rules we can get credit only for reductions below ppm Maybe that is intellectually OK but the shocker is that there is now in Kern County no requirement to reduce emissions to RACT standards So they keep polluting at ppm We have the same concern with the cement plant initiative we are taking mentioned in item d We are working with the largest single source of pollution in the SF Bay Area to retrofit it with SCRs which if successful will reduce emissions by tons per year enough for at least a MW plant However there is a plant in Germany just starting up with SCRs We are concerned that air officials here will become aware of that plant and RACT adjust any emissions reductions we may get I will tell you if that happens the plant will not make the retrofit as the economics simply do not work and they will continue to pollute You can mention in public the Kern County example but please do not breathe a word

<4844403.1075848131477.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,david.parquet@enron.com,2001-01-30 02:44:00,Re Urgent Steve Kean to testify at Senate hearing need infomore item e Suspend or relax the RACT Reasonably Available Control Technology adjustment requirements to promote the creation of cleaner air and ERCs Example When we were having difficulty in finding ERCs for Pastoria we realized that there were quite a few operating gas turbine projects in Kern County We developed an agreement with GE because the projects all had GE turbines and GE serviced them to approach the owners of the projects and offer to retrofit new emissions reduction technology in exchange for an attractive business deal The appropriate technology is Dry Low NOX DLN which reduces NOX emissions from permitted levels of ppm to ppm To our surprise since these reductions are RACT per present Clean Air Rules we can get credit only for reductions below ppm Maybe that is intellectually OK but the shocker is that there is now in Kern County no requirement to reduce emissions to RACT standards So they keep polluting at ppm We have the same concern with the cement plant initiative we are taking mentioned in item d We are working with the largest single source of pollution in the SF Bay Area to retrofit it with SCRs which if successful will reduce emissions by tons per year enough for at least a MW plant However there is a plant in Germany just starting up with SCRs We are concerned that air officials here will become aware of that plant and RACT adjust any emissions reductions we may get I will tell you if that happens the plant will not make the retrofit as the economics simply do not work and they will continue to pollute You can mention in public the Kern County example but please do not breathe a word about the cement plant initiative Forwarded by David ParquetSFECT on AM David Parquet PM To Elizabeth NRON cc Alan CT James D nron Jeff nron John NeslageENRON NRON NRON Margaret NRON Mary nron Richard

Steves point on siting new power plants I ASSUME SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE IS THE FEDERAL SENATE NOT THE STATE SENATE I HAVE GEARED MY SUGGESTIONS TO THINGS THE FEDS CAN OR SHOULD DO THE PREAMBLE The continuing lack of leadership by the Governor is causing serious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to make the billions in investments required for new power plants The desparate search for blame placing of exactly the guys that would make the investment the lawsuits the simplistic outright misrepresentations of what happened and is happening the threats of condemnation etc are doing a good job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the market that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in power plants in the states history To the point the debt lenders are getting nervous the equity providors are getting nervous Duke I would have less third world risk developing a plant in Brazil If the final result of all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid and the buying and selling of power the cynic might observe that we will have traded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion to the old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases In my opinion there is no way that the governors present political initiatives will result in the number of power plants that are necessary to cover the demand He may be covering the near term pricesupply issues with his CDWR initiative I note that it is winter time and power demand is down notwithstanding stage alerts wait until summer peak demands but destroyed the desire of the long term risk takers to develop new plants in this market If the politicians think the state can do the development I dont think so Think about it there just is not anyone in the IOUs or CDWR or the Munis or any state agency that can make the decisions necessary to make the investments required IN A TIMELY MANNER The public entities do not even have the staffs to do the required work much less the political environment to get anything done given the continued thirst for doing things right vs doing the right thing Maybe we will get back to long term power purchase agreements for the development of new power plants I point out that the Standard Offer contracts developed by the State and entered into YEARS AGO in a regulated environment by nearly MW of QFs are STILL OUT OF THE MONEY Per SCE since the PX began in only during August and December of last year were they in the money We checked it out they are right That is astounding And we want to go back to that Enron would be pleased to participate in long term PPAs especially since we are developing several sites and can make money doing that But if we want to be statesmen about this we need must get a market paradigm back THE SUGGESTIONS Federal Environmental issues There are agencies in CA that get involved in air issues US EPA CEC CARB and the local AQMD Lots of rhetoric that each is just doing its own job but the de facto result of that many agencies looking at the inevitably overlapping issues is that the requirements end up much tougher than they need to be Letting the state deal with the last and focusing on the US EPA because of where Steve will be testifying seems like the US EPA probably through a change in law at the Federal level could do the following a Take a leadership position in rationalizing the rat warren of districts and basins and ERC creation and transfer restrictions To our utter amazement every little district that we have gone into to develop power plants have completely different rules and have required a completely different approach re ERCs SF Bay Area South Coast San Joaquin County Kern County Placer etc ERCs are the single biggest problem we have in moving forward on the development of over MW of new plants we have on the books I point out the ERC market in the east for SOX SOX ERCs produced in Ohio can be used in a new plant in Indiana This is not technically crisp but was a rational political decision as part of the Clean Air Act We need that same rationalization now in California Granted CA and its politics was probably the genesis of the arbitrariness of AQMD vs county boundaries vs basin boundaries but if we can get the state to the table to change this the EPA will be involved Leadership by all is necessary When ppm new plants are being held up the ppm plants will continue to be used to produce the power Do the math and tell me if the pollution produced during the period of delay is worth the result Do it again realizing that many of these ppm plants will never be developed given the difficulty b Consider impact fees the concept of pay to pollute In LA there are car pool requirements to reduce pollution If a company cannot or will not carpool sufficiently they can pay a fine that the district applies I think to general programs like electric water heaters vs gas electric lawn mowers vs gasoline mass transit etc Implement a similar program for power plants Work in concert with the local air district and the EPA to develop a program that allows the developer to pay the market price for credits FYI million for Pastoria which the district uses to develop credits from existing sources that have not yet been cleaned up see list lines above and others Necessity power plant proceeds while credits are being develop If it takes years to develop the credits consider issues and value of fact that the ppm plant will eventually replace the ppm plants c Stop the crusade for ever lower BACT requirements that are based on vague representations inconclusive data and over zealous developer agreements Example Several years ago Goalline Technologies developed SCONOX for NOX reduction in a MW unit in LA Good thing to do but based primarily on the results of that small unit and the salesmanship of Goallines president we got ratcheted down on our MW plant in Pittsburg to ppm SCAQMD calls to SCR vendors indicated we can do that EPA jumped on board Guarantees from EPC contractors with LDs for nonperformance are different than we can do that from an equipment supplier Now EPA and others are wanting ppm again based on vague data Sam even advises requests to consider ppm I point out that there are ZERO frame Fa units in operation at these levels in California GE has told us absolutely not to a ppm guarantee However I believe that requirements will in fact be reduced again by EPA just because they can Again do the math on delaying or stopping the development of say a ppm plant because EPA wants ppm in favor of the continued operation of a ppm plant Hugely more resultant pollution d Be open minded and proactive with developers novel methods of creating new sources of ERCs PGE had a heck of a time creating ERCs for their Otay Mesa MW power plant in San Diego ending up putting new engines in harbor boats and garbage trucks Enron has several similarly dificult initiatives underway Steve cannot tell anyone this FYI only we are looking at replacing engines in harbor boats in SF Bay replacing engines in yard locomotives in Sacramento and LA replacing agricultural pumping engines in the Central Valley putting SCR technology in cement plants all over CA We could take years to get these programs approved as did PGE or we can take several months with EPAs and others leadership Federal Siting Issues California is at least attempting through legislation to speed up the siting on new power plants Unfortunately the Federal agencies do not have the time line requirements to provide their review on the speeded up schedules For example a request of the Fish and Wildlife Department for a reviewpermit gets put on the priority pile first come first serve shopping centers housing developments power plants power lines etc I understand that our Pastoria project had FW applications ahead of it when we applied And there was no limitation on how long they could take to get the review done I understand that one power project has waited years for its review The only way we got our permit was Sam Wehn begged FW to figure a way to get it done ahead of the other applications Fortunately FW figured that we could reapply under an EPA rule in this specific case which did have a timeline limitation We should not have to rely on luck to get plants permitted Suggestion require the federal agencies involved in power plant or transmission line permitting to speed up their reviewpermitting times to be consistent with the state initiatives to speed things up Market Issues I will not go into this in detail as Steve is more able than I to vocalize these issues However from a power plant development point of view if we want the private sector to develop MERCHANT power plants and I believe we do because of the enormity of the investment required we must get back to a market structure As I am sure Steve remembers one of the big issues we all dealt with in deregulation was stranded cost We can avoid those issues by getting the private sector to make the investments Steve knows all the issues stability liquidity credit worthy counterparties

novel methods of creating new sources of ERCs PGE had a heck of a time creating ERCs for their Otay Mesa MW power plant in San Diego ending up putting new engines in harbor boats and garbage trucks Enron has several similarly dificult initiatives underway Steve cannot tell anyone this FYI only we are looking at replacing engines in harbor boats in SF Bay replacing engines in yard locomotives in Sacramento and LA replacing agricultural pumping engines in the Central Valley putting SCR technology in cement plants all over CA We could take years to get these programs approved as did PGE or we can take several months with EPAs and others leadership Federal Siting Issues California is at least attempting through legislation to speed up the siting on new power plants Unfortunately the Federal agencies do not have the time line requirements to provide their review on the speeded up schedules For example a request of the Fish and Wildlife Department for a reviewpermit gets put on the priority pile first come first serve shopping centers housing developments power plants power lines etc I understand that our Pastoria project had FW applications ahead of it when we applied And there was no limitation on how long they could take to get the review done I understand that one power project has waited years for its review The only way we got our permit was Sam Wehn begged FW to figure a way to get it done ahead of the other applications Fortunately FW figured that we could reapply under an EPA rule in this specific case which did have a timeline limitation We should not have to rely on luck to get plants permitted Suggestion require the federal agencies involved in power plant or transmission line permitting to speed up their reviewpermitting times to be consistent with the state initiatives to speed things up Market Issues I will not go into this in detail as Steve is more able than I to vocalize these issues However from a power plant development point of view if we want the private sector to develop MERCHANT power plants and I believe we do because of the enormity of the investment required we must get back to a market structure As I am sure Steve remembers one

<13086665.1075848245872.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,david.parquet@enron.com,2001-01-30 02:44:00,Re Urgent Steve Kean to testify at Senate hearing need infomore item e Suspend or relax the RACT Reasonably Available Control Technology adjustment requirements to promote the creation of cleaner air and ERCs Example When we were having difficulty in finding ERCs for Pastoria we realized that there were quite a few operating gas turbine projects in Kern County We developed an agreement with GE because the projects all had GE turbines and GE serviced them to approach the owners of the projects and offer to retrofit new emissions reduction technology in exchange for an attractive business deal The appropriate technology is Dry Low NOX DLN which reduces NOX emissions from permitted levels of ppm to ppm To our surprise since these reductions are RACT per present Clean Air Rules we can get credit only for reductions below ppm Maybe that is intellectually OK but the shocker is that there is now in Kern County no requirement to reduce emissions to RACT standards So they keep polluting at ppm We have the same concern with the cement plant initiative we are taking mentioned in item d We are working with the largest single source of pollution in the SF Bay Area to retrofit it with SCRs which if successful will reduce emissions by tons per year enough for at least a MW plant However there is a plant in Germany just starting up with SCRs We are concerned that air officials here will become aware of that plant and RACT adjust any emissions reductions we may get I will tell you if that happens the plant will not make the retrofit as the economics simply do not work and they will continue to pollute You can mention in public the Kern County example but please do not breathe a word about the cement plant initiative Forwarded by David ParquetSFECT on AM David Parquet PM To Elizabeth NRON cc Alan CT James D nron Jeff nron John NeslageENRON NRON NRON Margaret NRON Mary nron Richard B CT Sandra NRON Steve CT Steven J nron Susan J NRON Subject Re Urgent Steve Kean to testify at Senate hearing need info I have little that Steve does not probably know by heart But a few comments to Steves point on siting new power plants I ASSUME SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE IS THE FEDERAL SENATE NOT THE STATE SENATE I HAVE GEARED MY SUGGESTIONS TO THINGS THE FEDS CAN OR SHOULD DO THE PREAMBLE The continuing lack of leadership by the Governor is causing serious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to make the billions in investments required for new power plants The desparate search for blame placing of exactly the guys that would make the investment the lawsuits the simplistic outright misrepresentations of what happened and is happening the threats of condemnation etc are doing a good job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the market that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in power plants in the states history To the point the debt lenders are getting nervous the equity providors are getting nervous Duke I would have less third world risk developing a plant in Brazil If the final result of all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid and the buying and selling of power the cynic might observe that we will have traded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion to the old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases In my opinion there is no way that the governors present political initiatives will result in the number of power plants that are necessary to cover the demand He may be covering the near term pricesupply issues with his CDWR initiative I note that it is winter time and power demand is down notwithstanding stage alerts wait until summer peak demands but destroyed the desire of the long term risk takers to develop new plants in this market If the politicians think the state can do the development I dont think so Think about it there just is not anyone in the IOUs or CDWR or the Munis or any state agency that can make the decisions necessary to make the investments required IN A TIMELY MANNER The public entities do not even have the staffs to do the required work much less the political environment to get anything done given the continued thirst for doing things right vs doing the right thing Maybe we will get back to long term power purchase agreements for the development of new power plants I point out that the Standard Offer contracts developed by the State and entered into YEARS AGO in a regulated environment by nearly MW of QFs are STILL OUT OF THE MONEY Per SCE since the PX began in only during August and December of last year were they in the money We checked it out they are right That is astounding And we want to go back to that Enron would be pleased to participate in long term PPAs especially since we are developing several sites and can make money doing that But if we want to be statesmen about this we need must get a market paradigm back THE SUGGESTIONS Federal Environmental issues There are agencies in CA that get involved in air issues US EPA CEC CARB and the local AQMD Lots of rhetoric that each is just doing its own job but the de facto result of that many agencies looking at the inevitably overlapping issues is that the requirements end up much tougher than they need to be Letting the state deal with the last and focusing on the US EPA because of where Steve will be testifying seems like the US EPA probably through a change in law at the Federal level could do the following a Take a leadership position in rationalizing the rat warren of districts and basins and ERC creation and transfer restrictions To our utter amazement every little district that we have gone into to develop power plants have completely different rules and have required a completely different approach re ERCs SF Bay Area South Coast San Joaquin County Kern County Placer etc ERCs are the single biggest problem we have in moving forward on the development of over MW of new plants we have on the books I point out the ERC market in the east for SOX SOX ERCs produced in Ohio can be used in a new plant in Indiana This is not technically crisp but was a rational political decision as part of the Clean Air Act We need that same rationalization now in California Granted CA and its politics was probably the genesis of the arbitrariness of AQMD vs county boundaries vs basin boundaries but if we can get the state to the table to change this the EPA will be involved Leadership by all is necessary When ppm new plants are being held up the ppm plants will continue to be used to produce the power Do the math and tell me if the pollution produced during the period of delay is worth the result Do it again realizing that many of these ppm plants will never be developed given the difficulty b Consider impact fees the concept of pay to pollute In LA there are car pool requirements to reduce pollution If a company cannot or will not carpool sufficiently they can pay a fine that the district applies I think to general programs like electric water heaters vs gas electric lawn mowers vs gasoline mass transit etc Implement a similar program for power plants Work in concert with the local air district and the EPA to develop a program that allows the developer to pay the market price for credits FYI million for Pastoria which the district uses to develop credits from existing sources that have not yet been cleaned up see list lines above and others Necessity power plant proceeds while credits are being develop If it takes years to develop the credits consider issues and value of fact that the ppm plant will eventually replace the ppm plants c Stop the crusade for ever lower BACT requirements that are based on vague representations inconclusive data and over zealous developer agreements Example Several years ago Goalline Technologies developed SCONOX for NOX reduction in a MW unit in LA Good thing to do but based primarily on the results of that small unit and the salesmanship of Goallines president we got ratcheted down on our MW plant in Pittsburg to ppm SCAQMD calls to SCR vendors indicated we can do that EPA jumped on board Guarantees from EPC contractors with LDs for nonperformance are different than we can do that from an equipment supplier Now EPA and others are wanting ppm again based on vague data Sam even advises requests to consider ppm I point out that there are ZERO frame Fa units in operation at these levels in California GE has told us absolutely not to a ppm guarantee However I believe that requirements will in fact be reduced again by EPA just because they can Again do the math on delaying or stopping the

Cal ISO interconnection proc Amend FYI Forwarded by Jeff DasovichNAEnron on AM Christi L CT AM To Susan J NRON Alan CT Jeff nron Steve CT cc James D nron Subject Cal ISO interconnection proc Amend I reviewed the Cal ISO filings below in Sues note to determine general consistency with FERC orders on interconnection procedures Potential issues are identified below and you all can decide if Enron should protestintervene the West Developers may want to review this too Since I am not familiar with the Cal ISO procedures I cannot determine whether protest is necessary for example PJM NY and NEPOOL have certain interconnection policies that would not be acceptable outside the pool but that work ok for the pool The TOs have also filed Amend interconnection procedures but I have not looked at those to see if they mirror these Maybe one of the paralegals could check that In addition one of you should review the filing letter and procedures to make sure that the statements made by Cal ISO are correct Filing letter The Cal ISO states that these procedures are filed in response to FERCs orders and that the Cal ISO and Market Participants are examining policies that will ensure that the ISO Controlled Grid is expanded to support competitive markets It also states that it would have liked to propose complementary changes to its longterm planning and expansion process but other priorities have prevented it from doing so Discusses the two previously methodologies regarding interconnection procedures No Grandfathering of Transmission Rights and Advance Congestion Cost Mitigation which was apparently rejected last year Filing Letter at Cal ISO does not propose a method of sharing upgrade costs but states that the procedures do not preclude such a provision This is one we have used in other Inter Agreements If required by law or if the Parties mutually agree to allow one or more third parties to use the Interconnection Facilities or any part thereof whether by transfer of the Interconnection Facilities to an RTO or otherwise and such use decreases the capacity of the Interconnection Facilities available to TO or the Facility or otherwise causes any detriment to TO or the Facility or benefits any party including TO other than Generator or if TO is compensated for the costs of the Interconnection Facilities in whole or in part for any reason Generator will be entitled to compensation from TO based upon the pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities by TO all third party users and Generator for the greater of i whatever costs Generator incurred in connection with the Interconnection Facilities plus interest at the Interest Rate from the date of Generators payment of the costs in connection with the Interconnection Facilities and ii the value that TO receives for the Interconnection Facilities Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence the Parties may use any other mutually agreed upon methodology to determine such compensation If one or more third parties are to use the Interconnection Facilities in accordance with Section Generators obligation to reimburse TO for the operation and maintenance costs incurred by TO in connection with the Interconnection Facilities shall be based on the pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities by TO all third parties users and Generator or on some other mutually agreed upon methodology provided however that under no circumstances shall Generators share of TOs operation and maintenance costs be greater than its pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities Procedures The timelines for submitting applications and responding to system impact studies SIS and facilities study FS are fine per previous FERC orders in fact Cal ISO asks for days to complete the Facilities Study PGE just filed requesting days c I would add on a nondiscriminatory basis after unless otherwise agreed by the ISO and the Interconnecting PTO allows the generator to perform its own SIS and FS subject to review by the Cal ISO and TO this is a good provision that has not been adopted by many utilities The SIS will identify adverse impact on Encumbrances undefined Someone needs to check this provision since I am not familiar with this Cal ISO rule A New Facility Operator is entitled to amend its Completed Application once without losing its queue spot Other utilities allow amendments as long as the change is not material which has only been defined by the utility and approved by FERC in several cases This Cal ISO proposed provision could be problematic to other generators in the queue if it is not limited to material unless Enron is making the one time change In any event check with West Developers on this provision This provision requiring a New Facility Operator to execute or have filed unsigned at FERC an Interconnection Agreement within days if no upgrades or within days if upgrades can be a problem Cal ISO does not file a pro forma Interconnection Agreement in these procedures If Cal ISO tenders a poor interconnection agreement draft which happens all the time with other utilities then there is no way that Enron would typically want to execute it within those time limits For example Duke did not file an pro forma interconnection agreement but does allow days for negotiation In my experience the negotiation of the interconnection agreement can take a long time It would be advisable for the Cal ISO to file a pro forma at FERC then you can protest if necessary and at least there will be a fairly decent interconnection agreement to use a The Queuing Milestones appear to be fairly rigid and quick require the New Facility Operator to comply with the ISO tariff and the TO tariff and within months of its Completed Application Date satisfy all applicable Data Adequacy Requirements of state and local siting and other regulatory authorities I dont know that months is achievable FERC has approved milestones in other cases but most contain language requiring reasonable movement toward the milestones For example in Duke ER Section Transmission Provider may reasonably extend any such milestone dates in the event of delays not caused by the Generation Interconnection Customer such as unforeseen regulatory or construction delays that could not be remedied by Gen Int Customer through the exercise of due diligence and may also reasonably extend milestone dates to which the Gen Int Customer has not agreed and which the Gen Int Customer has challenged at the Commission pending a Commission determination as to the reasonableness of such dates In addition the Cal ISO only allows one extension of days probably not enough b requires a New Facility License within months after satisfying the Data Adequacy Requirements does not provide for transmission credits for network upgrades upgrades other than the costs of interconnection The Cal ISO recognized this exclusion in its filing letter at but thinks that such issues are appropriately addressed as part of the process to revise the ISOs longterm grid planning process Enron has argued and won at FERC for transmission credits in other utility cases

need to respond to him The NUMBER ONE problem we have in California that is delaying our proposed power plant developments is securing ERCs My discussions with Calpine indicate that ERCs are their biggest problem as well And in case someone hasnt noticed the two most active developers in CAlifornia are Enron and Calpine Air quality laws are definitely slowing us down and slowing others down which keeps the new cleaner plants from being developed As I have mentioned before this is actually making air quality worse in that the older dirtier plants are running more Further if you do the math we will probably never make up for the dirty air that is created by keeping the dirty plants in business because of grandfathering while the clean plants dont get done because of ever more rigorous BACT standards and lack of ERCs Having said that I do not agree that we should send a message that we want to relax or suspend the standards However getting ppm plants on line which will put out of business the ppm plants as Calpine indicated to me happened in Texas makes the point that maybe a relaxation or suspension is the environmentally appropriate thing to do All in all though I believe that sucha common sense approach will go nowhere in California because the little people in the regulatory positions as well as the public will make sure that we pay for such a message Having said that I will repeat the key things that we should be promoting in my opinion stop the EPA from tightening the BACT standards to ever increasing levels of insanity GE will not guarantee the present and new EPA requirement of ppm which EPA determined with no new operating data They just did it because they could Stop making up rules for RACT adjustments Kelly Brodbeck is working very hard for example to develop a program in the Bay Area to retrofit boats with clean burning engines to create ERCs A high level staff guy at BAAQMD believes that we should be RACT adjusted probably making the program uneconomic There isnt even unanimity for this position on his staff However this position if it sticks is irresponsible in light of the fact that the boats can just keep on doing what they are doing We are creating ERCs which the BAAQMD will take a portion of in their haircut and in using the ERCs we will eventually put out of business the dirtier plants So our program gets RACT adjusted and the air gets dirtier Allow for payment of mitigation fees in lieu of buying ERCs There is precedent for that but this has to be run through the SIP and the EPA Again the inlieu fees can be used for gov sponsored ERC developments eg electric lawn mowers electric water heaters etc which will clean the air I am aware that Sandy is working with the CA legislature on this Go Sandy Sandra NRON AM

Sandra McCubbinNAEnron on AM Mary Schoen PM To cc Subject California says clean air not power crisis cause Friday May California regulators told congressional lawmakers on Thursday that clean air regulations are not to blame for the states electricity shortages and said new legislation seeking to ease air quality rules was unneeded Speaking at a House Commerce Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee hearing the head of the California Air Resources Board repeatedly said environmental regulations should not be suspended for the sake of electricity Air quality laws are not interfering with Californias ability to bring new generation on line and run existing power plants at maximum capacity said Michael Kenny executive officer of the board When asked by Democratic lawmakers on the panel about a provision in a pending electricity bill the California regulator said the state did not ask for a relaxation of clean air rules and did not need the change We believe that air qualityrelated sections of the legislation are unnecessary Kenny said Rep Joe Barton the Texas Republican who chairs the energy subcommittee said the measures allow flexibility to states for the temporary suspension of environmental laws He said the key point of his bill is to ensure the lights stay on in California this summer The Golden State expects to face threats of blackouts starting this month when air conditioning use accelerates Objections raised by Kenny to the Barton bill included disagreement on a section allowing the US Environmental Protection Agency to waive when asked by a state the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act pertaining to nitrogen oxide emissions Kenny said the state already gives flexibility on the issue and contended the legislation would go too far and be problematic The waiver applies to all new generation facilities in the state and does not allow for consideration on a casebycase generating plant by generating plant basis where unique local factors can be weighed said Kenny

commentssuggestions We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA In attendance were Ken Lay the Governor the Governors staff director Kari Dohn and myself The gov spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governors ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors comments Overview We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees His staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers including utilityowned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at MW He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by and provide some political cover Our proposals I have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided He seemed interested in the buy down of significant demand the state setting a goal of x MW of new generation by a date certain getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases As already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities His ideas The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming Some of these ideas would require legislative action State may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases This was a frequently recurring theme WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THIS MUST DEAL WITH CREDIT ISSUES IN OUR LIFE TIME NOTE THAT WE ARE TALKING TO SCE ABOUT A TOLLING AGT FROM LV COGEN CREDIT ISSUES ARE OPEN Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a costplus basis to consumers Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California State universities including UCCSU and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation Expand instate gas production Take state lands gas royalties in kind negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies Empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time THIS IS DONE NOW BY THE ISO Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state DO NOT THINK THIS WILL GO TOO FAR AS EMISSIONS OFFSETS ARE A FEDERAL ISSUE HOWEVER THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THE STATE COULD DO TO PROMOTE ERCS SEE PREVIOUS ISSUES DISCUSSED WITH STATE OFFICIALS INCLUDING STEVENS ET AL SORRY I DO NOT HAVE THE DOC ON MY VACATION ASK SAM FOR A COPY OF HIS SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS THIS PROMOTION COULD BE CONDITIONED ON SELLING IN STATE Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how Nordpool worksJeff someone in Schroeders group should be able to help out here NICE SCAPEGOAT Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new instate generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators REQUIRING IN STATE SALE IS PROBALY RESTRAINT OF TRADE HOWEVER GETTING THE SAME OUTCOME THROUGH INCENTINVES EG LONG TERM CONTRACTS IS BETTER CONFIDENTIALLY I KNOW THAT AES IS NEGOTIATING A PPA WITH SCE FOR ITS MOJAVE PLANT I PRESUME AS A CONDITION TO CONTINUING TO GET TO BUY IT THAT IS FINE Securitize uncollected power purchase costs SEE MY COMMENTS RE FRANK VICKERS EMAIL TO THE POINT CANNOT SECURITIZE IF HAVE A PHONY SRAC IE ONE BASED ON WACOG IF PUT IT BACK TO BORDER INDEX GAS BASED SRAC CAN SECURITIZE EASILY To dos Jeff again Id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to Kari He wants to see year fixed power prices for peak offpeak and baseload not just the one year strips He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal I DO NOT KNOW AB OUT YOU BUT I THINK IT IS A COP OUT THAT THE UTILITIES ARE THE BLAME FOR THIS AND SHOULD TAKE ALL THE BRUNT FOR THE HIGH PRICES NOTWITHSTANDING FLORIOS COMMENTS THAT HE WAS ALWAYS AGAINST DEREGULATION I THINK THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THE PROBLEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DEREGULATION VERY HIGH LOAD GROWTH NO GENERATION BUILT FOR YEARS THAT WAS PROBABLY THE PROBLEM OF THE REGULATED REGIME LOW HYDRO IN NW HIGH GROWTH IN ADJACENT STATES ETC I THINK IF GOV WAS HONEST WITH CONSUMERS NO RATE INCREASE FOR YEARS IT IS NOW TIME THAT CONSUMERS WOULD BE OK WITH INCREASE MY BIGGEST SUGGESTION IS TO THAT WHATEVER IS DONE IS DONE IN CONTEXT OF AN OVERALL PLAN THAT ACCOMODATES UTILITY CREDIT RATE INCREASES GENERATION ETC ETC EACH PARTY DOES NOT HAVE TO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING BUT IF EVERYONE CAN SEE THE WHOLE PLAN THEN I BELIEVE THINGS WILL WORK He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues Thanks to everyone for their help We made some progress today

<12460450.1075843342054.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,david.parquet@enron.com,2001-01-29 04:08:00,Re Urgent Steve Kean to testify at Senate hearing need info Cc little that Steve does not probably know by heart But a few comments to Steves point on siting new power plants I ASSUME SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE IS THE FEDERAL SENATE NOT THE STATE SENATE I HAVE GEARED MY SUGGESTIONS TO THINGS THE FEDS CAN OR SHOULD DO THE PREAMBLE The continuing lack of leadership by the Governor is causing serious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to make the billions in investments required for new power plants The desparate search for blame placing of exactly the guys that would make the investment the lawsuits the simplistic outright misrepresentations of what happened and is happening the threats of condemnation etc are doing a good job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the market that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in power plants in the states history To the point the debt lenders are getting nervous the equity providors are getting nervous Duke I would have less third world risk developing a plant in Brazil If the final result of all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid and the buying and selling of power the cynic might observe that we will have traded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion to the old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases In my opinion there is no way that the governors present political initiatives will result in the number of power plants that are necessary to cover the demand He may be covering the near term pricesupply issues with his CDWR initiative I note that it is winter time and power demand is down notwithstanding stage alerts wait until summer peak demands but destroyed the desire of the long term risk takers to develop new plants in this market If the politicians think the state can do the development I dont think so Think about it there just is not anyone in the IOUs or CDWR or the Munis or any state agency that can make the decisions necessary to make the investments required IN A TIMELY MANNER The public entities do not even have the staffs to do the required work much less the political environment to get anything done given the continued thirst for doing things right vs doing the right thing Maybe we will get back to long term power purchase agreements for the development of new power plants I point out that the Standard Offer contracts developed by the State and entered into YEARS AGO in a regulated environment by nearly MW of QFs are STILL OUT OF THE MONEY Per SCE since the PX began in only during August and December of last year were they in the money We checked it out they are right That is astounding And we want to go back to that Enron would be pleased to participate in long term PPAs especially since we are developing several sites and can make money doing that But if we want to be statesmen about this we need must get a market paradigm back THE SUGGESTIONS Federal Environmental issues There are agencies in CA that get involved in air issues US EPA CEC CARB and the local AQMD Lots of rhetoric that each is just doing its own job but the de facto result of that many agencies looking at the inevitably overlapping issues is that the requirements end up much tougher than they need to be Letting the state deal with the last and focusing on the US EPA because of where Steve will be testifying seems like the US EPA probably through a change in law at the Federal level could do the following a Take a leadership position in rationalizing the rat warren of districts and basins and ERC creation and transfer restrictions To our utter amazement every little district that we have gone into to develop power plants have completely different rules and have required a completely different approach re ERCs SF Bay Area South Coast San Joaquin County Kern County Placer etc ERCs are the single biggest problem we have in moving forward on the development of over MW of new plants we have on the books I point out the ERC market in the east for SOX SOX ERCs produced in Ohio can be used in a new plant in Indiana This is not technically crisp but was a rational political decision as part of the Clean Air Act We need that same rationalization now in California Granted CA and its politics was probably the genesis of the arbitrariness of AQMD vs county boundaries vs basin boundaries but if we can get the state to the table to change this the EPA will be involved Leadership by all is necessary When ppm new plants are being held up the ppm plants will continue to be used to produce the power Do the math and tell me if the pollution produced during the period of delay is worth the result Do it again realizing that many of these ppm plants will never be developed given the difficulty b Consider impact fees the concept of pay to pollute In LA there are car pool requirements to reduce pollution If a company cannot or will not carpool sufficiently they can pay a fine that the district applies I think to general programs like electric water heaters vs gas electric lawn mowers vs gasoline mass transit etc Implement a similar program for power plants Work in concert with the local air district and the EPA to develop a program that allows the developer to pay the market price for credits FYI million for Pastoria which the district uses to develop credits from existing sources that have not yet been cleaned up see list lines above and others Necessity power plant proceeds while credits are being develop If it takes years to develop the credits consider issues and value of fact that the ppm plant will eventually replace the ppm plants c Stop the crusade for ever lower BACT requirements that are based on vague representations inconclusive data and over zealous developer agreements Example Several years ago Goalline Technologies developed SCONOX for NOX reduction in a MW unit in LA Good thing to do but based primarily on the results of that small unit and the salesmanship of Goallines president we got ratcheted down on our MW plant in Pittsburg to ppm SCAQMD calls to SCR vendors indicated we can do that EPA jumped on board Guarantees from EPC contractors with LDs for nonperformance are different than we can do that from an equipment supplier Now EPA and others are wanting ppm again based on vague data Sam even advises requests to consider ppm I point out that there are ZERO frame Fa units in operation at these levels in California GE has told us absolutely not to a ppm guarantee However I believe that requirements will in fact be reduced again by EPA just because they can Again do the math on delaying or stopping the development of say a ppm plant because EPA wants ppm in favor of the continued operation of a ppm plant Hugely more resultant pollution d Be open minded and proactive with developers novel methods of creating new sources of ERCs PGE had a heck of a time creating ERCs for their Otay Mesa MW power plant in San Diego ending up putting new engines in harbor boats and garbage trucks Enron has several similarly dificult initiatives underway Steve cannot tell anyone this FYI only we are looking at replacing engines in harbor boats in SF Bay replacing engines in yard locomotives in Sacramento and LA replacing agricultural pumping engines in the Central Valley putting SCR technology in cement plants all over CA We could take years to get these programs approved as did PGE or we can take several months with EPAs and others leadership Federal Siting Issues California is at least attempting through legislation to speed up the siting on new power plants Unfortunately the Federal agencies do not have the time line requirements to provide their review on the speeded up schedules For example a request of the Fish and Wildlife Department for a reviewpermit gets put on the priority pile first come first serve shopping centers housing developments power plants power lines etc I understand that our Pastoria project had FW applications ahead of it when we applied And there was no limitation on how long they could take to get the review done I understand that one power project has waited years for its review The only way we got our permit was Sam Wehn begged FW to figure a way to get it done ahead of the other applications Fortunately FW figured that we could reapply under an EPA rule in this specific case which did have a timeline limitation We should not have to rely on luck to get plants permitted Suggestion require the federal agencies involved in power plant or transmission line permitting to speed up their reviewpermitting times to be consistent with the state initiatives to speed things up Market Issues I will not go into this in detail as Steve is more able than I to vocalize these issues However from a power plant development point of view if we want the private sector to develop MERCHANT power plants and I believe we do because of the enormity of the investment required we must get back to a market structure As I am sure Steve remembers one of the big issues we all dealt with in deregulation was stranded cost We can avoid those issues by getting the private sector to make the investments Steve knows all the issues stability liquidity

Department PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY AND PGE CORPORATION FILE PLAN OF REORGANI ZATION Plan Pays Claims in Full Does Not Call for Retail Rate Increases or State Bailout San Francisco CA PGE Corporation NYSE PCG and its utility unit Paci fic Gas and Electric Company jointly filed a Plan of Reorganization in US Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company to pa y all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter bankruptcy p roceedings The official creditors committee supports the plan This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect ric Company to move out of Chapter as a financially strong business posi tioned to continue safe reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr icity to its customers pay all valid creditor claims in full and do so wi thout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout said Robert D Glynn Jr Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman CEO and Pr esident of PGE Corporation And the plan will enable us to provide long term growth prospects to shareholders The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PGE Corporation into two separate standalone companies no longer affiliated with one anot her The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste m The electric generation electric transmission and natural gas transmi ssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p art of PGE Corporation The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a nd Electric will be distributed to PGE Corporation shareholders The electric generation electric transmission and gas transmission operati ons when reorganized as new businesses under PGE Corporation will have t he ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi c Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors claims The plan also re structures certain existing debt and uses billion in cash on hand to s atisfy creditor claims Under the plan all valid creditor claims will be paid in full using a com bination of cash and longterm notes In total the plan will provide cred itors with about billion in cash and billion in notes The vast m ajority of creditorsthose with allowed claims of or lesswill rec eive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec tive date of the plan Most secured creditors will also receive percen t of their allowed claims in cash Finally unsecured creditors with allow ed claims in excess of the threshold will be paid percent in ca sh and percent in notes Following the restructuring Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PGE Corporation will be organized as follows Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat ion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i ts customers in Northern and Central California It will hold percent o f the current utility assets in terms of book value and will employ people Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu ll range of utility services to one out of every Americans PGE Corporation in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus iness will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri c generation electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl y under Pacific Gas and Electric Company The new electric generation business will be a California company establish ed to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a ssociated lands and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district s now held by the utility In total the unit will have approximately megawatts of generation The facilities will be operated in accordance with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses and in ke eping with sound environmental stewardship policies The generating busine ss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com pany under a year contract at a stable marketbased rate The new electric transmission business will be a California company establi shed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u tility The system comprises circuit miles of electric transmission lines and cables The new gas transmission business will be a California company established to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b y the utility including miles of transmission pipelines and three ga s storage facilities Following the reorganization the California Public Utilities Commission wi ll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company i ncluding retail electric and natural gas rates The Federal Energy Regulat ory Commission FERC will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses for the hydroelectric assets and the rates terms and conditions of servic e provided by the electric transmission business FERC will also assume ju risdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant and over the rates terms and conditions of service for the ga s transmission system which will become an interstate pipeline Glynn said This plan without raising retail rates provides a safe reli able and longterm electric supply to California customers It enables our company to maintain a qualified workforce And it enables us to keep our generating assets intact and integrated rather than selling them piecemeal to pay creditors The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent ially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga nization We envision essentially the same experienced dedicated team continuing to do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs said Glynn We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t he people who know how to run them best In addition to resolving creditors claims and maintaining stability for cu stomers and employees the plan also provides longterm benefits to the sta te It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power for customers by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect ric Company would be financially able to reassume the procurement responsi bility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R esources The Chapter process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented Paul Aronzon legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito rs said This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r esolve creditors claims and restore PGEs creditworthiness It has our f ull support and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte r process With this plan filed said Glynn we are now focused on bringing the Cha pter process to completion reaffirming the financial health and creditw orthiness of our operations through this reorganization restoring customer s confidence and rebuilding value for our shareholders At AM Pacific Time today PGE Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electr ic Company will discuss the plan of reorganization on a conference call for members of the media The dialin number for the call is or Passcode At AM Pacific Time today PGE

Utility These statements are necessarily subjec t to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to dif fer materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements Although PGE Corporation and the Utility are not able to predict all of th e factors that may affect whether the Plan will be confirmed or whether i f confirmed it will become effective some of the factors that could affec t the outcome materially include the pace of the Bankruptcy Court proceedi ngs the extent to which the Plan is amended or modified legislative and r egulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the elect ric and natural gas industries in the United States particularly in Califo rnia whether the Utility is able to obtain timely regulatory approvals or whether the Utility is able to obtain regulatory approvals at all risks re lating to the issuance of new debt securities by each of the disaggregated entities including higher interest rates than are assumed in the financial projections which could affect the amount of cash raised to satisfy allowe d claims and the inability to successfully market the debt securities due to among other reasons an adverse change in market conditions or in the c ondition of the disaggregated entities before completion of the offerings whether the Bankruptcy Court exercises its authority to preempt relevant n onbankruptcy law and if so whether and the extent to which such assertion of jurisdiction is successfully challenged whether a favorable tax ruling or opinion is obtained regarding the taxfree nature of the internal restr ucturings and spin off contemplated by the Plan and the ability of the Ut ility to successfully disaggregate its businesses Please visit our websites wwwpgecorpcom and wwwpgecom

need to respond to him The NUMBER ONE problem we have in California that is delaying our proposed power plant developments is securing ERCs My discussions with Calpine indicate that ERCs are their biggest problem as well And in case someone hasnt noticed the two most active developers in CAlifornia are Enron and Calpine Air quality laws are definitely slowing us down and slowing others down which keeps the new cleaner plants from being developed As I have mentioned before this is actually making air quality worse in that the older dirtier plants are running more Further if you do the math we will probably never make up for the dirty air that is created by keeping the dirty plants in business because of grandfathering while the clean plants dont get done because of ever more rigorous BACT standards and lack of ERCs Having said that I do not agree that we should send a message that we want to relax or suspend the standards However getting ppm plants on line which will put out of business the ppm plants as Calpine indicated to me happened in Texas makes the point that maybe a relaxation or suspension is the environmentally appropriate thing to do All in all though I believe that sucha common sense approach will go nowhere in California because the little people in the regulatory positions as well as the public will make sure that we pay for such a message Having said that I will repeat the key things that we should be promoting in my opinion stop the EPA from tightening the BACT standards to ever increasing levels of insanity GE will not guarantee the present and new EPA requirement of ppm which EPA determined with no new operating data They just did it because they could Stop making up rules for RACT adjustments Kelly Brodbeck is working very hard for example to develop a program in the Bay Area to retrofit boats with clean burning engines to create ERCs A high level staff guy at BAAQMD believes that we should be RACT adjusted probably making the program uneconomic There isnt even unanimity for this position on his staff However this position if it sticks is irresponsible in light of the fact that the boats can just keep on doing what they are doing We are creating ERCs which the BAAQMD will take a portion of in their haircut and in using the ERCs we will eventually put out of business the dirtier plants So our program gets RACT adjusted and the air gets dirtier Allow for payment of mitigation fees in lieu of buying ERCs There is precedent for that but this has to be run through the SIP and the EPA Again the inlieu fees can be used for gov sponsored ERC developments eg electric lawn mowers electric water heaters etc which will clean the air I am aware that Sandy is working with the CA legislature on this Go Sandy Sandra NRON AM

Sandra McCubbinNAEnron on AM Mary Schoen PM To cc Subject California says clean air not power crisis cause Friday May California regulators told congressional lawmakers on Thursday that clean air regulations are not to blame for the states electricity shortages and said new legislation seeking to ease air quality rules was unneeded Speaking at a House Commerce Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee hearing the head of the California Air Resources Board repeatedly said environmental regulations should not be suspended for the sake of electricity Air quality laws are not interfering with Californias ability to bring new generation on line and run existing power plants at maximum capacity said Michael Kenny executive officer of the board When asked by Democratic lawmakers on the panel about a provision in a pending electricity bill the California regulator said the state did not ask for a relaxation of clean air rules and did not need the change We believe that air qualityrelated sections of the legislation are unnecessary Kenny said Rep Joe Barton the Texas Republican who chairs the energy subcommittee said the measures allow flexibility to states for the temporary suspension of environmental laws He said the key point of his bill is to ensure the lights stay on in California this summer The Golden State expects to face threats of blackouts starting this month when air conditioning use accelerates Objections raised by Kenny to the Barton bill included disagreement on a section allowing the US Environmental Protection Agency to waive when asked by a state the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act pertaining to nitrogen oxide emissions Kenny said the state already gives flexibility on the issue and contended the legislation would go too far and be problematic The waiver applies to all new generation facilities in the state and does not allow for consideration on a casebycase generating plant by generating plant basis where unique local factors can be weighed said Kenny

reviewed the Cal ISO filings below in Sues note to determine general consistency with FERC orders on interconnection procedures Potential issues are identified below and you all can decide if Enron should protestintervene the West Developers may want to review this too Since I am not familiar with the Cal ISO procedures I cannot determine whether protest is necessary for example PJM NY and NEPOOL have certain interconnection policies that would not be acceptable outside the pool but that work ok for the pool The TOs have also filed Amend interconnection procedures but I have not looked at those to see if they mirror these Maybe one of the paralegals could check that In addition one of you should review the filing letter and procedures to make sure that the statements made by Cal ISO are correct Filing letter The Cal ISO states that these procedures are filed in response to FERCs orders and that the Cal ISO and Market Participants are examining policies that will ensure that the ISO Controlled Grid is expanded to support competitive markets It also states that it would have liked to propose complementary changes to its longterm planning and expansion process but other priorities have prevented it from doing so Discusses the two previously methodologies regarding interconnection procedures No Grandfathering of Transmission Rights and Advance Congestion Cost Mitigation which was apparently rejected last year Filing Letter at Cal ISO does not propose a method of sharing upgrade costs but states that the procedures do not preclude such a provision This is one we have used in other Inter Agreements If required by law or if the Parties mutually agree to allow one or more third parties to use the Interconnection Facilities or any part thereof whether by transfer of the Interconnection Facilities to an RTO or otherwise and such use decreases the capacity of the Interconnection Facilities available to TO or the Facility or otherwise causes any detriment to TO or the Facility or benefits any party including TO other than Generator or if TO is compensated for the costs of the Interconnection Facilities in whole or in part for any reason Generator will be entitled to compensation from TO based upon the pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities by TO all third party users and Generator for the greater of i whatever costs Generator incurred in connection with the Interconnection Facilities plus interest at the Interest Rate from the date of Generators payment of the costs in connection with the Interconnection Facilities and ii the value that TO receives for the Interconnection Facilities Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence the Parties may use any other mutually agreed upon methodology to determine such compensation If one or more third parties are to use the Interconnection Facilities in accordance with Section Generators obligation to reimburse TO for the operation and maintenance costs incurred by TO in connection with the Interconnection Facilities shall be based on the pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities by TO all third parties users and Generator or on some other mutually agreed upon methodology provided however that under no circumstances shall Generators share of TOs operation and maintenance costs be greater than its pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities Procedures The timelines for submitting applications and responding to system impact studies SIS and facilities study FS are fine per previous FERC orders in fact Cal ISO asks for days to complete the Facilities Study PGE just filed requesting days c I would add on a nondiscriminatory basis after unless otherwise agreed by the ISO and the Interconnecting PTO allows the generator to perform its own SIS and FS subject to review by the Cal ISO and TO this is a good provision that has not been adopted by many utilities The SIS will identify adverse impact on Encumbrances undefined Someone needs to check this provision since I am not familiar with this Cal ISO rule A New Facility Operator is entitled to amend its Completed Application once without losing its queue spot Other utilities allow amendments as long as the change is not material which has only been defined by the utility and approved by FERC in several cases This Cal ISO proposed provision could be problematic to other generators in the queue if it is not limited to material unless Enron is making the one time change In any event check with West Developers on this provision This provision requiring a New Facility Operator to execute or have filed unsigned at FERC an Interconnection Agreement within days if no upgrades or within days if upgrades can be a problem Cal ISO does not file a pro forma Interconnection Agreement in these procedures If Cal ISO tenders a poor interconnection agreement draft which happens all the time with other utilities then there is no way that Enron would typically want to execute it within those time limits For example Duke did not file an pro forma interconnection agreement but does allow days for negotiation In my experience the negotiation of the interconnection agreement can take a long time It would be advisable for the Cal ISO to file a pro forma at FERC then you can protest if necessary and at least there will be a fairly decent interconnection agreement to use a The Queuing Milestones appear to be fairly rigid and quick require the New Facility Operator to comply with the ISO tariff and the TO tariff and within months of its Completed Application Date satisfy all applicable Data Adequacy Requirements of state and local siting and other regulatory authorities I dont know that months is achievable FERC has approved milestones in other cases but most contain language requiring reasonable movement toward the milestones For example in Duke ER Section Transmission Provider may reasonably extend any such milestone dates in the event of delays not caused by the Generation Interconnection Customer such as unforeseen regulatory or construction delays that could not be remedied by Gen Int Customer through the exercise of due diligence and may also reasonably extend milestone dates to which the Gen Int Customer has not agreed and which the Gen Int Customer has challenged at the Commission pending a Commission determination as to the reasonableness of such dates In addition the Cal ISO only allows one extension of days probably not enough b requires a New Facility License within months after satisfying the Data Adequacy Requirements does not provide for transmission credits for network upgrades upgrades other than the costs of interconnection The Cal ISO recognized this exclusion in its filing letter at but thinks that such issues are appropriately addressed as part of the process to revise the ISOs longterm grid planning process Enron has argued and won at FERC for transmission credits in other utility cases

heart But a few comments to Steves point on siting new power plants I ASSUME SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE IS THE FEDERAL SENATE NOT THE STATE SENATE I HAVE GEARED MY SUGGESTIONS TO THINGS THE FEDS CAN OR SHOULD DO THE PREAMBLE The continuing lack of leadership by the Governor is causing serious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to make the billions in investments required for new power plants The desparate search for blame placing of exactly the guys that would make the investment the lawsuits the simplistic outright misrepresentations of what happened and is happening the threats of condemnation etc are doing a good job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the market that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in power plants in the states history To the point the debt lenders are getting nervous the equity providors are getting nervous Duke I would have less third world risk developing a plant in Brazil If the final result of all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid and the buying and selling of power the cynic might observe that we will have traded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion to the old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases In my opinion there is no way that the governors present political initiatives will result in the number of power plants that are necessary to cover the demand He may be covering the near term pricesupply issues with his CDWR initiative I note that it is winter time and power demand is down notwithstanding stage alerts wait until summer peak demands but destroyed the desire of the long term risk takers to develop new plants in this market If the politicians think the state can do the development I dont think so Think about it there just is not anyone in the IOUs or CDWR or the Munis or any state agency that can make the decisions necessary to make the investments required IN A TIMELY MANNER The public entities do not even have the staffs to do the required work much less the political environment to get anything done given the continued thirst for doing things right vs doing the right thing Maybe we will get back to long term power purchase agreements for the development of new power plants I point out that the Standard Offer contracts developed by the State and entered into YEARS AGO in a regulated environment by nearly MW of QFs are STILL OUT OF THE MONEY Per SCE since the PX began in only during August and December of last year were they in the money We checked it out they are right That is astounding And we want to go back to that Enron would be pleased to participate in long term PPAs especially since we are developing several sites and can make money doing that But if we want to be statesmen about this we need must get a market paradigm back THE SUGGESTIONS Federal Environmental issues There are agencies in CA that get involved in air issues US EPA CEC CARB and the local AQMD Lots of rhetoric that each is just doing its own job but the de facto result of that many agencies looking at the inevitably overlapping issues is that the requirements end up much tougher than they need to be Letting the state deal with the last and focusing on the US EPA because of where Steve will be testifying seems like the US EPA probably through a change in law at the Federal level could do the following a Take a leadership position in rationalizing the rat warren of districts and basins and ERC creation and transfer restrictions To our utter amazement every little district that we have gone into to develop power plants have completely different rules and have required a completely different approach re ERCs SF Bay Area South Coast San Joaquin County Kern County Placer etc ERCs are the single biggest problem we have in moving forward on the development of over MW of new plants we have on the books I point out the ERC market in the east for SOX SOX ERCs produced in Ohio can be used in a new plant in Indiana This is not technically crisp but was a rational political decision as part of the Clean Air Act We need that same rationalization now in California Granted CA and its politics was probably the genesis of the arbitrariness of AQMD vs county boundaries vs basin boundaries but if we can get the state to the table to change this the EPA will be involved Leadership by all is necessary When ppm new plants are being held up the ppm plants will continue to be used to produce the power Do the math and tell me if the pollution produced during the period of delay is worth the result Do it again realizing that many of these ppm plants will never be developed given the difficulty b Consider impact fees the concept of pay to pollute In LA there are car pool requirements to reduce pollution If a company cannot or will not carpool sufficiently they can pay a fine that the district applies I think to general programs like electric water heaters vs gas electric lawn mowers vs gasoline mass transit etc Implement a similar program for power plants Work in concert with the local air district and the EPA to develop a program that allows the developer to pay the market price for credits FYI million for Pastoria which the district uses to develop credits from existing sources that have not yet been cleaned up see list lines above and others Necessity power plant proceeds while credits are being develop If it takes years to develop the credits consider issues and value of fact that the ppm plant will eventually replace the ppm plants c Stop the crusade for ever lower BACT requirements that are based on vague representations inconclusive data and over zealous developer agreements Example Several years ago Goalline Technologies developed SCONOX for NOX reduction in a MW unit in LA Good thing to do but based primarily on the results of that small unit and the salesmanship of Goallines president we got ratcheted down on our MW plant in Pittsburg to ppm SCAQMD calls to SCR vendors indicated we can do that EPA jumped on board Guarantees from EPC contractors with LDs for nonperformance are different than we can do that from an equipment supplier Now EPA and others are wanting ppm again based on vague data Sam even advises requests to consider ppm I point out that there are ZERO frame Fa units in operation at these levels in California GE has told us absolutely not to a ppm guarantee However I believe that requirements will in fact be reduced again by EPA just because they can Again do the math on delaying or stopping the development of say a ppm plant because EPA wants ppm in favor of the continued operation of a ppm plant Hugely more resultant pollution d Be open minded and proactive with developers novel methods of creating new sources of ERCs PGE had a heck of a time creating ERCs for their Otay Mesa MW power plant in San Diego ending up putting new engines in harbor boats and garbage trucks Enron has several similarly dificult initiatives underway Steve cannot tell anyone this FYI only we are looking at replacing engines in harbor boats in SF Bay replacing engines in yard locomotives in Sacramento and LA replacing agricultural pumping engines in the Central Valley putting SCR technology in cement plants all over CA We could take years to get these programs approved as did PGE or we can take several months with EPAs and others leadership Federal Siting Issues California is at least attempting through legislation to speed up the siting on new power plants Unfortunately the Federal agencies do not have the time line requirements to provide their review on the speeded up schedules For example a request of the Fish and Wildlife Department for a reviewpermit gets put on the priority pile first come first serve shopping centers housing developments power plants power lines etc I understand that our Pastoria project had FW applications ahead of it when we applied And there was no limitation on how long they could take to get the review done I understand that one power project has waited years for its review The only way we got our permit was Sam Wehn begged FW to figure a way to get it done ahead of the other applications Fortunately FW figured that we could reapply under an EPA rule in this specific case which did have a timeline limitation We should not have to rely on luck to get plants permitted Suggestion require the federal agencies involved in power plant or transmission line permitting to speed up their reviewpermitting times to be consistent with the state initiatives to speed things up Market Issues I will not go into this in detail as Steve is more able than I to vocalize these issues However from a power plant development point of view if we want the private sector to develop MERCHANT power plants and I believe we do because of the enormity of the investment required we must get back to a market structure As I am sure Steve remembers one of the big issues we all dealt with in deregulation was stranded cost We can avoid those issues by getting the private sector to make the investments Steve knows all the issues stability liquidity

Scott ES Dennis ES Robert CT Jeff nron Sandra nron Susan J NRON Richard nron James D nron Paul CT Mary CT Joe NRON Mark NRON Karen NRON cc Subject Meeting with Governor Davis need for additional commentssuggestions We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA In attendance were Ken Lay the Governor the Governors staff director Kari Dohn and myself The gov spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governors ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors comments Overview We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees His staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers including utilityowned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at MW He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by and provide some political cover Our proposals I have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided He seemed interested in the buy down of significant demand the state setting a goal of x MW of new generation by a date certain getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases As already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities His ideas The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming Some of these ideas would require legislative action State may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases This was a frequently recurring theme WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THIS MUST DEAL WITH CREDIT ISSUES IN OUR LIFE TIME NOTE THAT WE ARE TALKING TO SCE ABOUT A TOLLING AGT FROM LV COGEN CREDIT ISSUES ARE OPEN Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a costplus basis to consumers Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California State universities including UCCSU and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation Expand instate gas production Take state lands gas royalties in kind negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies Empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time THIS IS DONE NOW BY THE ISO Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state DO NOT THINK THIS WILL GO TOO FAR AS EMISSIONS OFFSETS ARE A FEDERAL ISSUE HOWEVER THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THE STATE COULD DO TO PROMOTE ERCS SEE PREVIOUS ISSUES DISCUSSED WITH STATE OFFICIALS INCLUDING STEVENS ET AL SORRY I DO NOT HAVE THE DOC ON MY VACATION ASK SAM FOR A COPY OF HIS SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS THIS PROMOTION COULD BE CONDITIONED ON SELLING IN STATE Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how Nordpool worksJeff someone in Schroeders group should be able to help out here NICE SCAPEGOAT Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new instate generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators REQUIRING IN STATE SALE IS PROBALY RESTRAINT OF TRADE HOWEVER GETTING THE SAME OUTCOME THROUGH INCENTINVES EG LONG TERM CONTRACTS IS BETTER CONFIDENTIALLY I KNOW THAT AES IS NEGOTIATING A PPA WITH SCE FOR ITS MOJAVE PLANT I PRESUME AS A CONDITION TO CONTINUING TO GET TO BUY IT THAT IS FINE Securitize uncollected power purchase costs SEE MY COMMENTS RE FRANK VICKERS EMAIL TO THE POINT CANNOT SECURITIZE IF HAVE A PHONY SRAC IE ONE BASED ON WACOG IF PUT IT BACK TO BORDER INDEX GAS BASED SRAC CAN SECURITIZE EASILY To dos Jeff again Id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to Kari He wants to see year fixed power prices for peak offpeak and baseload not just the one year strips He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal I DO NOT KNOW AB OUT YOU BUT I THINK IT IS A COP OUT THAT THE UTILITIES ARE THE BLAME FOR THIS AND SHOULD TAKE ALL THE BRUNT FOR THE HIGH PRICES NOTWITHSTANDING FLORIOS COMMENTS THAT HE WAS ALWAYS AGAINST DEREGULATION I THINK THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THE PROBLEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DEREGULATION VERY HIGH LOAD GROWTH NO GENERATION BUILT FOR YEARS THAT WAS PROBABLY THE PROBLEM OF THE REGULATED REGIME LOW HYDRO IN NW HIGH GROWTH IN ADJACENT STATES ETC I THINK IF GOV WAS HONEST WITH CONSUMERS NO RATE INCREASE FOR YEARS IT IS NOW TIME THAT CONSUMERS WOULD BE OK WITH INCREASE MY BIGGEST SUGGESTION IS TO THAT WHATEVER IS DONE IS DONE IN CONTEXT OF AN OVERALL PLAN THAT ACCOMODATES UTILITY CREDIT RATE INCREASES GENERATION ETC ETC EACH PARTY DOES NOT HAVE TO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING BUT IF EVERYONE CAN SEE THE WHOLE PLAN THEN I BELIEVE THINGS WILL WORK He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues Thanks to everyone for their help We made some progress today
