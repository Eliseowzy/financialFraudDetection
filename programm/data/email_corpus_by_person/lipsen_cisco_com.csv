the hand of the state is an extremely frightening proposition Unfortunately it falls inline with what Gov Davis likes to do which is to control all of the process himself I know John will not be able to digest all of this but will brief him over the phone on the excellent arguments you make here against support for ABX I will give you all feedback from the meetings tomorrow Thanks for all your help Laura At AM wrote Hi Laura Ive attached three things but first wanted to give you a bit of an update on events transpiring in Sacramento and at the Public Utilities Commission Move to Prohibit Customer Choice As you may know ABX the bill that the Legislature recently passed and the Governor signed gives the California Department of Water Resources the authority to buy power on behalf of the utilities Included in that bill however is a provision that prohibits Direct Access Californias term for customer choice In sum the bill in its current form prohibits businesses and consumers from chosing an alternative energy service provider like Enron Our understanding is that the Department of Finance called for the prohibition Their reasoning is that they need a captive customer base to pay for the bonds that the State will issue in order to finance DWRs power purchases Customer choice was of course the foundation of Californias restructuring law AB and is arguably the only bright spot in an otherwise fatally flawed plan For example the only businesses and consumers that were protected in San Diego when rates were deregulated last year were those businesses and consumers that had signed fixed price power deals with competitive service providers Ironically the recently passed legislation takes choices away from consumers and diminishes their ability to manage their energy costs Before AB consumers and businesses had one choicethe monopoly utility With the passage of AB X they again will have one choice But this time their only choice will be to buy from a government agency DWR A broad coalition of consumer groups has expressed its opposition to the prohibition and Senator Debra Bowen a key player on the Senate side and Fred Keeley a key player on the Assembly side have promised to fix the prohibition in another bill SBX Ill forward in another email the language that the coalition has drafted and hopes Bowen and Keeley will carry Unfortunately we are now hearing rumors that the Governor intends to direct the California Public Utilities to immediately implement the provisions of ABX prohibiting Direct Access despite the fact that a large coalition of consumers and service providers are actively working with Bown and Keeley to amend the prohibition language It would be extremely useful if the folks participating in the meeting on Thursday with the Governor let him know that taking choices away from businesses and customers is the wrong way to go and that he and the legislative leaders need to work with the coalition to fix it Youll note in the language developed by the coalition that the proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the Dept of Finances concerns about recouping DWRs costs of buying power and the need to give consumers and businesses maximum flexible in managing their energy costs Move to Have the State Take Over the Electric Industry in California John Burton the Democratic leader of the Senate insists that if California is going to bail out the utilities the State needs to get something in return Burton wants the state to buy and operate PGEs and Edisons transmission system and create a state power authority that would get in the business of among other things developing financing constructing and operating power plants and natural gas pipelines Burton got both of these bills designed to take over the industry passd out of his committee yesterday SBX and SBX It is unclear how much support he has in the full Senate or in the Assembly but the possibility of passage is certainly greater than zero at this juncture Others experts are offering a better alternative When the federal government helped Chrysler out of its financial difficulties years ago the federal government received stock warrants in return Until recently the Governor favored warrants but more recently he has waivered in his statements regarding a state take over Burton appears to have negotiating leverage with the Governor and appears to be using it Again it would be extremely useful for folks to let the Govenor know in the meetings on Thursday that a State take over of the industry is an extreme move and bad public policy I will forward to you in a separate email letters that we sent to Burton expressing our opposition to his bills and the reasons for our opposition In brief there is no shortage of private capital ready and willing to invest in Californias energy infrastructure ie power plants electric transmission lines gas pipelines All California needs to do is create the investment climate necessary to attract the capital In addition history shows that the State is extremely illequipped to become Californias megautility Here are the attachments A demand buydown proposal We made this proposal to the Governor and continue to propose it to policymakers in Sacramento Washington DC and just about everywhere else In short the notion is that if the market is willing to pay power producers say centskwh to produce power then the market ought to be willing to pay businesses and consumers centskwh to reduce power consumption This approach is critical for two reasons first it provides businesses and consumers the financial incentives necessary and that California currently lacks to conserve energy and use energy more efficiently Second because California delayed identifying and implementing a solution to Californias energy crisis its options for addressing the severe shortages that are likely occur this summer are very limited Reducing demand represents one of the few options that can help to immediately reduce the gap between supply and demand Putting financial incentives in place now to reduce demand and free up electrons is an investment with significant payback A manifesto recently released by a group of Berkeley and Stanford economists and industry experts urging the Govenor to pursue a marketoriented solution to Californias energy crisis An editorial in yesterdays Wall Street Journal by Dan McFadden a nobel prizewinning economist from Berkeley echoing the proposal advanced in the manifesto McFadden was one of the manifestos signatories Finally we are working on model Legislation proposing a marketbased solution that we will share with you soon and that we hope the business communityand the Valley in particularcan embrace and advocate I realize that this is a lot of information and I apologize for the length of this note but I wanted to try to make sure that youre uptodate Please dont hesitate to give me a call if youd

<11762789.1075848138676.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lipsen@cisco.com,2001-02-14 09:58:00,Re California Power Crisis Cc Thanks for this analysis I think we would all agree that the solution to put power in the hand of the state is an extremely frightening proposition Unfortunately it falls inline with what Gov Davis likes to do which is to control all of the process himself I know John will not be able to digest all of this but will brief him over the phone on the excellent arguments you make here against support for ABX I will give you all feedback from the meetings tomorrow Thanks for all your help Laura At AM wrote Hi Laura Ive attached three things but first wanted to give you a bit of an update on events transpiring in Sacramento and at the Public Utilities Commission Move to Prohibit Customer Choice As you may know ABX the bill that the Legislature recently passed and the Governor signed gives the California Department of Water Resources the authority to buy power on behalf of the utilities Included in that bill however is a provision that prohibits Direct Access Californias term for customer choice In sum the bill in its current form prohibits businesses and consumers from chosing an alternative energy service provider like Enron Our understanding is that the Department of Finance called for the prohibition Their reasoning is that they need a captive customer base to pay for the bonds that the State will issue in order to finance DWRs power purchases Customer choice was of course the foundation of Californias restructuring law AB and is arguably the only bright spot in an otherwise fatally flawed plan For example the only businesses and consumers that were protected in San Diego when rates were deregulated last year were those businesses and consumers that had signed fixed price power deals with competitive service providers Ironically the recently passed legislation takes choices away from consumers and diminishes their ability to manage their energy costs Before AB consumers and businesses had one choicethe monopoly utility With the passage of AB X they again will have one choice But this time their only choice will be to buy from a government agency DWR A broad coalition of consumer groups has expressed its opposition to the prohibition and Senator Debra Bowen a key player on the Senate side and Fred Keeley a key player on the Assembly side have promised to fix the prohibition in another bill SBX Ill forward in another email the language that the coalition has drafted and hopes Bowen and Keeley will carry Unfortunately we are now hearing rumors that the Governor intends to direct the California Public Utilities to immediately implement the provisions of ABX prohibiting Direct Access despite the fact that a large coalition of consumers and service providers are actively working with Bown and Keeley to amend the prohibition language It would be extremely useful if the folks participating in the meeting on Thursday with the Governor let him know that taking choices away from businesses and customers is the wrong way to go and that he and the legislative leaders need to work with the coalition to fix it Youll note in the language developed by the coalition that the proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the Dept of Finances concerns about recouping DWRs costs of buying power and the need to give consumers and businesses maximum flexible in managing their energy costs Move to Have the State Take Over the Electric Industry in California John Burton the Democratic leader of the Senate insists that if California is going to bail out the utilities the State needs to get something in return Burton wants the state to buy and operate PGEs and Edisons transmission system and create a state power authority that would get in the business of among other things developing financing constructing and operating power plants and natural gas pipelines Burton got both of these bills designed to take over the industry passd out of his committee yesterday SBX and SBX It is unclear how much support he has in the full Senate or in the Assembly but the possibility of passage is certainly greater than zero at this juncture Others experts are offering a better alternative When the federal government helped Chrysler out of its financial difficulties years ago the federal government received stock warrants in return Until recently the Governor favored warrants but more recently he has waivered in his statements regarding a state take over Burton appears to have negotiating leverage with the Governor and appears to be using it Again it would be extremely useful for folks to let the Govenor know in the meetings on Thursday that a State take over of the industry is an extreme move and bad public policy I will forward to you in a separate email letters that we sent to Burton expressing our opposition to his bills and the reasons for our opposition In brief there is no shortage of private capital ready and willing to invest in Californias energy infrastructure ie power plants electric transmission lines gas pipelines All California needs to do is create the investment climate necessary to attract the capital In addition history shows that the State is extremely illequipped to become Californias megautility Here are the attachments A demand buydown proposal We made this proposal to the Governor and continue to propose it to policymakers in Sacramento Washington DC and just about everywhere else In short the notion is that if the market is willing to pay power producers say centskwh to produce power then the market ought to be willing to pay businesses and consumers centskwh to reduce power consumption This approach is critical for two reasons first it provides businesses and consumers the financial incentives necessary and that California currently lacks to conserve energy and use energy more efficiently Second because California delayed identifying and implementing a solution to Californias energy crisis its options for addressing the severe shortages that are likely occur this summer are very limited Reducing demand represents one of the few options that can help to immediately reduce the gap between supply and demand Putting financial incentives in place now to reduce demand and free up electrons is an investment with significant payback A manifesto recently released by a group of Berkeley and Stanford economists and industry experts urging the Govenor to pursue a marketoriented solution to Californias energy crisis An editorial in yesterdays Wall Street Journal by Dan McFadden a nobel prizewinning economist from Berkeley echoing the proposal advanced in the manifesto McFadden was one of the manifestos signatories Finally we are working on model Legislation proposing a marketbased solution that we will share with you soon and that we hope the business communityand the Valley in particularcan embrace
