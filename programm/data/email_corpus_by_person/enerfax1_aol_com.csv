has come up with a schedule for the states Department of Water Resources to pay off about million in late payments to generators by February The ISO oversees a daily power auction and acts as the billing agent for sales The operators have contended that the DWRs status as credit guarantor for Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison relieved it of responsibility for making direct payments However earlier this month the FERC declared the DWR as scheduling coordinator a typical designation for utilities making the water department liable for purchases it made on behalf of the utilities and gave the operators days to submit a payment plan for the period of January to July The utilities still owe generators about billion for power purchased over that time and the DWR is owed about billion for power supplied over the same period resulting in arrears of about million The water department says it has reserved about billion in preparation for such a payment The ISO says that the FERCordered dualbilling system would be too complex and costly and asked that the commission allow it to use the current system under which all payments would be disbursed by February th weeks

Pacific PanCanadian and Alberta Energy Merge PanCanadian Energy and Alberta Energy have reached an agreement to merge forming one of the top independent oil and natural gas company in the world in terms of proved reserves production and value The share swap deal will create a C billion exploration and production company with operations in the US the North Sea and Ecuador and major Canadianbased operations The newly merged company will be called EnCana Corporation The top executives of each company plan to enhance the market value and prevent a takeover of either firm Canadian energy companies have historically experienced a lower stock market value than US rivals in terms of multiples of projected cash flow per share used to measure the value of companies Some say that pension funds looking to invest in North America exploration would not have considered the companies before because they were too small but the new company is large enough to attract institutional investors It has been estimated that EnCana could eventually have a multiple of to times cash flow suggesting a target price of C to C Competitors Anadarko and Burlington Resources currently trade at times and

financial statements have generally cast doubt on corporate accounting practices Some say that the stock market now carries a higher equity risk premium because of Enrons collapse In some cases investors who lose money in one market unwound their exposure in others leading to a spiral of forced selling Even companies with no Enron exposure are experiencing investor risk aversion equal to those that had direct financial dealings with the company For example Kmart would likely not have been vulnerable to energy sector risks in the past But Kmart claimed that insurers had raised premiums for surety bonds which Kmart needed to cover certain contingent liabilities Enrons collapse also worried investors about other energy companies like Calpine El Paso and Mirant forcing them to adjust their balance sheets The fallout from Enron likely led to a downturn in outstanding commercial and industrial loans over the past month Another sign of potential contagion effects is a million outflow from high yield bond funds last week was attributed by to fears aroused by the Enron and Kmart bankruptcies Each new Enron disclosure fuels fears that the economy is threatened by the fallout And whether actual contagion exists or not fear of it seems to led many companies to distance themselves from the energy trader Allegheny Energy Supply Company Salt River Project SRP and Sempra Energy

stay short although no new trades are recommended Prices continue in a pervasive downtrend yet stop loss provisions are in place to guard against any unexpected price rallies The massive short interest held by non commercial accounts is of concern but the stop loss provisions of the model are designed to cope with what economists call exogenous variables Weather storage and the economy are all negative and combined with the unfavorable technical environment suggest that prices could work still lower GasTrader Consultant is a natural gas futures trading program designed to minimize the opportunity costs losses that often result under the best intentioned but often misguided hedging programs Specific trading parameters are in place daily and trades are executed on the close or at predetermined trading points Results assume positions are maintained in the spot most liquid futures contract and are rolled over on the th of the month prior to contract expiration If the program is in a long mode producers and physical market longs would lift all hedges Conversely if the program is in a short mode end users would lift their hedges If the model is flat or neutral a conservative strategy requires hedging by both long and short market participants It is believed that by combining natural gas price trends with hedging requirements opportunity costs can be minimized and greater participation in market moves can be realized Hedging costs are synchronized with the market Check out the FREE TRIAL subscription Go to SubscribetoGasTradernet Energy Seminars Inc Announces Key

Pipeline PGE National Energy Group Platts Study Says Data Center Power Problems Never Happened Two years ago utilities feared a surge of new data center development would overwhelm the electric power supply but those fears were never realized Now utilities are preparing for the next wave of development of these facilities that house computers used to process and store digital information for the Internet according to the latest in a series of E Source reports from Platts A series of studies titled Delivering Energy Services to Internet Hotels and Other HighDensity Electronic Loads explains why those anticipated electric loads never materialized Many of the data centers that were planned for were never built Those built and operating are running at low occupancy rates Now utilities are preparing for a future wave of data center development as the economy improves and demand for Internetbased services increase accordingly The amount of power drawn by microprocessor chips continues to rise and so the computers installed in future data centers may demand much more power than those installed today However a future power crunch is unlikely as utilities are already preparing for the next wave of expansion Utilities are instituting infrastructure charges that shift risk from the utility industry to the data center developers They are also encouraging their data center customers to

OPTIMISTIC Market technicians are taking a close look at their charts to see if todays jump in prices will give way to bearish fundamentals The earlier gap on the price charts should be a good reference point for price support says John Beaver President Private Futures Group Oklahoma City Before todays trading a gap was left on the March daily bar chart by the trading that took place between January and January an extended holiday weekend The low price for the March contract on January was but the high price on January was thus a cent gap or area where no trading took place was left on the chart Todays trading also left a gap between the low and Fridays high of The significance of the gaps is that typically buying demand is so great or selling pressure so heavy that the market will gap higher or lower with the next days trading opening well above the previous days high or substantially lower than the low of the day before The gap on the March daily chart from should be a good reference point for support A gap was also left in todays trading The area between to is good intermediate support These gaps are significant in that they are holding said Beaver Other traders arent such strong believers Gaps are almost always filled if for no other reason than markets go up and down You wait long enough and they will be filled the question is when said a Houston trader I look at them but they are overrated Statistically they are extremely overrated and traders put way too much emphasis on them but because people do that you have to pay attention to them said a trader with Coquest Dallas Locals use more of an opening range than the gap Lets say weve got a gap between and Are you buying s or s Where do you buy Often the gap doesnt mean too much anyway he said I look at them buy I wouldnt risk my reputation on them Beaver is not deterred I wouldnt mind seeing the AGA come out and push prices to to so i could buy some more I think we could visit those

Skilling Tape Raises New Questions Congressional investigators reportedly have an October videotape in which former CEO Jeffrey Skilling vigorously defends Enrons accounting methods and touts the partnership deals now linked to its collapse The tape raises questions about Skillings recent testimony to lawmakers in which he said he knew of nothing wrong with Enrons finances when he resigned last August citing personal reasons In a transcript of the tape Skilling responds to an Enron employees concern about a Wall Street Journal article The September story discussed Enrons use of an accounting method that books longterm contracts as current income The article also said Enron would have had a nd quarter loss if not for million in unrealized gains from risk management activities However Skilling says the story is just totally without merit adding that Enrons accounting is conservative and the company provides more data in its annual report than anyone in a transactionbased industry He then concludes that the company is in a strong position from an accounting basis During the same meeting Skilling tells employees the company will be bringing in partners to help Enron leverage its capital in its new Enron Net Works division Earlier this month in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Skilling said he was not aware of any inappropriate financing arrangements designed to conceal liabilities or overstate earnings Skilling is likely to be asked again about Enrons partnerships at the Senate consumer affairs subcommittee hearing today He is also

Americas Europe Asia Pacific Analysts Testify Before Congress on Enron Rating Debacle Wall Street analysts whose firms sold most of the billion in stock and bonds issued by Enron testified before Congress yesterday that they were not influenced by their companies dealings with Enron and were misled about Enrons financial condition As late as November th of the analysts whose job it was to follow Enron still rated the company as buy or strong buy Enron has been involved in acquisitions valued about billion and held bond and note sales since Salomon Smith Barney was the biggest adviser on Enron mergers with about billion in transactions followed by Credit Suisse with billion Credit Suisse served as the sole lead manager for billion in secondary stock sales by Enron over the last years generating about million in fees Chase Manhattan arranged more than billion in financing for Enron Even though the analysts may not have directly benefited from their stock recommendations senators pointed to a potential conflict of interest because their firms have business ties with companies the analysts follow And analysts can receive bonuses based on overall profits of their firms which in turn can depend on the companies the analysts follow The analysts testifying at the hearing said they get bonuses on that basis Some have proposed new regulations to increase barriers between investment bankers and analysts within a security firm Analysts would have to disclose whether they personally hold any stock of a company they recommend and if their firm has business ties to that company The analysts that testified yesterday represent Credit Suisse JP Morgan Chase Lehman and Citigroups Salomon Smith Barney ENERGY ENERGYr FEAs Complete Suite of Energy Products BUILT FOR THE

Oct Nov Dec Jan PRICES AT KEY LEVEL Since late January natural gas futures have made an impressive advance of over cents under fundamental conditions that appear to be unsupportive of increasing prices Although students of the laws of supply and demand would require a shift in production consumption or other economic variables to revise their assessments of natural gas prices market technicians see the situation from the standpoint of only analyzing price behavior or variables derived from price movements I look at a number of different tools but there is a beautiful down trendline that projects lower prices says an Oklahoma City analyst The big debate as prices move up is that although there are overlapping technical patterns the current rise may be the fourth wave higher of a five wave pattern down and there is one more new price low coming The counter to that argument is that if prices reach and hold above prices will not make that final fifth wave down and that there is a bigger rally coming A close over per MMBtu not just a trade over is one issue that we are studying carefully he said Prices maybe at a pivotal point It will be key to see how prices handle themselves in the mid s Theres a very good chance that prices will retreat to the low s I am in a negative mode on this market But if we close above the trendline at then I will take a neutral to positive stance on this market CHECK OUT FREE TRIAL OF GASTRADER NEWSLETTER AT GASTRADERNET Progas Storage and Services Inc Progas can custom build gas storage in the Upper Midwest Design to your
