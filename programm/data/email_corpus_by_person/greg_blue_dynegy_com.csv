Pergher Gunther cc Subject POWER POINTSFor The Record Price Cap Follies Of POWER POINTSFor The Record Price Cap Follies Of By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesSignificant facts in the California electricity crisis of have been lost in the highpitched political response to a genuine economic problem Thats too bad because some of the lost truths are humorous others are enlightening The year began with California State Senator Steve Peace who was one of the chief architects of the states deregulation law boasting that California had fooled merchant power companies into paying too much for the power plants they bought from the states utilities The deregulation law was a bet that most of the industry nationwide would misperceive what we were doing and overbid on the power plants said Peace as reported by Intelligence Press in January When the California legislature entered the debate on electricity competition Peace went on to say in January the assumption was that you had to accept some level of compromise on reliability But what is fundamentally different in what we did compared to the national debate is that we said absolutely categorically you cannot compromise reliability We led with reliability Now of course this view of things is laughable By late June even Peace was foaming at the mouth before the California Independent System Operator about the new power plant owners and how they were gouging the state He demanded and eventually got the ISO board of governors to cut their price cap to a megawatthour from MWh For the record the ISOs lower price cap was a complete failure Not only didnt the price cap protect the states utilities from financial ruin it contributed to their losses During the week of Dec when western US wholesale power markets were well above MWh the ISO staff was buying massive amounts of juice at an average price of MWh in outofmarket purchases that were allowed under the price cap rule but not publicly reported The ISO staff was allowed to make these outofmarket purchases only from utilities outside of California So Californias independent power producers were selling to outofstate utilities for about MWh and the utilities were selling power back to the ISO for up to MWh Some Northwest utilities even started buying power from the plants PGE Corp PCG and Edison Internationals EIX Southern California Edison still own through in the California Power Exchanges dayahead market at MWh and then selling it back to the utilities through the ISOs realtime market at MWh That was pretty cheeky but market participants always take advantage of stupid rules if they can make a big profit At this point the ISO asked the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to dispense with its failed price cap and move to the FERCrecommended soft price cap which requires only that sellers document costs that justify power sold for more than MWh On Dec the FERC approved the emergency measure Prices fell but one would never know that listening to the California Public Utilities Commission The elimination of wholesale electricity price caps by FERC on December as confirmed by its order on December and the resulting fivefold increase in wholesale electricity prices has expanded the crisis the CPUC said in its ratecase ruling Thursday This is false and the CPUC staff knows it The CPUC wants to blame the FERC for the crisis because the FERC has said that the CPUC is to blame for discouraging PGE and Southern California Edison from purchasing power on a longterm basis What Sen Peace lacks in perception the CPUC lacks in integrity The highest price in the fouryear history of western electricity markets was recorded the morning of Dec about hours before the FERC killed the price cap Power for Monday at the midColumbia River hub traded overthecounter Friday morning at a high MWh because a cold front was expected to arrive over the weekend The lowest prices paid in the Northwest that day were MWh The cold front never fully materialized As a result the California Power Exchange which trades Monday power on Sunday rather than Friday as the overthecounter market does priced Monday Dec power at MWh This was above the old price cap of MWh but not bad considering where other western utilities had been trading Monday power two days earlier When the CPUC and California Gov Gray Davis talk about a fivefold increase in prices after the FERC lifted the price cap they are talking about the CalPXs clearing price index of on Dec But the CalPX went on record later calling that clearing price meaningless It was the result of a computer problem instituting the new soft price cap rules No electricity was bought or sold at that price in California that day and hours later the prices were refigured at MWh The overthecounter market had drifted down to MWh in the Northwest and to MWh in the Southwest And prices have been drifting down ever since Northwest power traded Friday at MWh and Southwest power traded at MWh Generators are coming back on line from fall maintenance and the weather is warmer than expected Pretty fundamental stuff but Steve Peace the CPUC and Gov Davis are still convinced they can simply dictate prices Sure And Alan Greenspan can save the Nasdaq By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires GMTAPDJ GMT
