<21517066.1075840825895.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,daniel.diamond@enron.com,2001-09-08 07:20:54,E Nymex Market Forces ENymex still on launchpadpst Market Forces ENymex still on launchpad Energy Compass c Energy Intelligence Group All rights reserved The New York Mercantile Exchange has been thinking about shifting some of its business online since early last year and possibly before that when it was invited to join the electronic IntercontinentalExchange ICE It rejected the offer which rival International Petroleum Exchange has since gladly accepted instead unveiling plans last May to build its own electronic trading platform for overthecounter and smaller futures contracts But its cyberspace initiative is still on the launchpad Called eNymex the online system was supposed to launch in October at the same time as the Big Oilbacked ICE But October came and went and while ICE appeared eNymex failed to show Its start date was pushed back to late and then to the first quarter of and then to the second quarter of this year Nymex held to that secondquarter target for months before again failing to deliver Its now given up on the third quarter as well and exchange executives have stopped trying to predict when the electronic trading platform will be ready to go Thats not the only blow to Nymexs etrade strategy Delays are also plaguing an internet version of its existing Access afterhours electronic trading system although it remains available as a proprietary dialup system to existing customers Late last month Nymex announced plans to make Access available over the internet at wwwnymexaccesscom in a move designed to widen its customer base But just a few days before the planned Sep start date the exchange pulled back EC Augp As with eNymex a new date has yet to be scheduled Launched in the dialup version of Access handled million contracts last year equal to of Nymexs total trading volume Nymex executives say that putting Access on the web could triple the volume of business completed on the platform The exchanges new Brent crude oil futures contract and other existing pittraded contracts are available on Access Compared with ICE which is steadily unveiling new services and products on its etrade system the New York exchanges path to building an electronic platform has been bumpy Earlier this year Nymex ended its relationship with Accenture formerly Andersen Consulting which had been involved in managing the exchanges transition to an electronic trading platform almost from the start Some observers characterized the move as a costcutting measure Nymex says Accenture was dismissed because its work was done Nymex blames many of the delays on GlobalView Software one of its technology partners with which it is involved in a bitter legal dispute In April Nymex filed a breach of contract lawsuit in a New York court against GlobalView alleging that the Chicagobased software firm had stopped work on eNymex and seeking unspecified damages GlobalView chief executive Jon Olson admits that his company did indeed stop work but says it was because Nymex stopped paying It is countersuing seeking around million for fees and damages Nymex president Bo Collins is also claiming that GlobalView has gone bankrupt But Olson says business is good for the yearold company which has around clients in the energy industry With GlobalView off the project Nymex has decided it will build the frontend piece of eNymex the part that GlobalView was working on When its all complete Nymex will have an etrade platform for derivatives and smaller futures contracts and a separate etrade service for its afterhours customers It will also have its existing pittraded contracts which it has no intention of ditching With so many different pieces some observers wonder what Nymex is up to Collins a onetime natural gas trader at USbased El Paso responds that Nymex aims to build an electronic cloud around its successful pit contracts Rather than disrupt a successful business Collins says the exchange is creating new electronic trading opportunities around its pittraded products The reality is we have a system of pit trading that provides immense liquidity to the market he says So I have got to figure out a way to marry the technology to the humanness of the process For example Nymexs Henry Hub natural gas futures contract is successful and several types of contracts trade on other exchanges based on the Henry Hub price Thats where eNymex will come in Collins says The etrade platform will offer spread and basis swaps contracts based on prices of Nymexs pit contracts thus marrying technology and the trading pit Some observers suggest that the eNymex rollout has taken a back seat to the exchanges newest product a Brent crude oil futures contract challenging the IPE The new contract which started trading on Sep was joined the following day by a new Brent options contract On Sep the New York exchange started offering a BrentWTI spread options contract The battle for the hearts and minds of Brent traders will rage in the traditional trading pits of New York and London for another year at least But over the next months all of the IPEs business will be shifted online to a futures trading platform being built by ICE The IPEs strategy is clear By agreeing to be acquired by ICE the London exchange obviously sees a future where commodities trading takes place in cyberspace not in a trading pit Nymex is betting that its electronic cloud strategy whereby etrade is married with pit trading will pay off In the end though the etrade versus pit trade battle being waged by the worlds two biggest oil futures exchanges may become secondary to the battle for Brent If Nymex can create liquidity in its new Brent contract its bumpy path toward etrade may be forgotten By Jeff Gosmano Houston Folder Name E Nymex Relevance Score on Scale of To review or revise your folder visit or contact Dow Jones Customer
