Christine Sent Monday November AM To Bajwa Bilal Alon Heather Fortunov Gallin Rohmer Gisselle Subject FW Highlights from this mornings ENEDYN analyst conference call This was forwarded to me this morning Someones notes from the call Listened in on the analyst call this morning Here are my notes Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements Watson spoke for c minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold MM shares out of a total MM shares of the postmerger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model uhoh They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enronrelated earnings accretion at which represents a haircut to Enron internal estimates Doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENEthere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these comments Patrick Tucker x

end of Q earnings targets Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited HOUSTON Oct Reuters Natural gas and power marketer and trader Dynegy Inc said on Monday that thirdquarter net earnings rose percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns The Houstonbased company said earnings rose to million or cents per diluted share from million or cents per diluted share for the same period of Companywide operating revenues rose to billion in the third quarter of versus billion in the similar yearago period Analysts polled by Thomson FinancialFirst Call expected earnings in a range of cents to cents a share with a mean estimate of cents Dynegy also said it raised its earnings estimate for the year to a range of to per diluted share from the target set on Oct It maintained a fourthquarter forecast of cents to cents a share and a forecast of to share All are in line with analysts estimates Chief Financial Officer Robert Doty said that the company was on track to achieve percent to percent earnings growth next year Our longterm strategy to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets supports earnings sustainability Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said in a statement I would say the companys ability to continuously post strong earnings growth illustrates their ability to successfully navigate through wildly various operating environments UBS Warburg analyst Jay Yannello said This company has rapidly emerged as the leading player in its field While stocks in its sector have been hammered sharply over the past six months Dynegy has been a better performer than similar companies Dynegys stock this year has fallen some percent outperforming the Standard Poors utilities index which has lost percent Despite the strong earnings growth shares of Dynegy were down or percent to in Monday afternoon trading Analysts cited rumors that the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC wants to renegotiate the power purchase contracts that the California Department of Water Resources holds with companies like Dynegy Calpine Corp Mirant Corp and Williams Cos Inc A spokesman for the Department of Water Resources however said it doesnt plan to renegotiate the deals These companies renegotiate contracts all the time The question is do they maintain value in the contracts or do they lose value in the contracts said analyst Jeff Dietert of Simmons and Co And I think the assumption that the market is making is that Dynegy and others would lose value in their contracts Dynegy still has an accounts receivable balance of about to million for power it produced for cashchallenged California utilities Were not out of the woods yet said President and Chief Operating Officer Stephen Bergstrom on a conference call But he noted there could be some resolution by the second or third quarter of next year After all PGE Corps Pacific and Gas Electric utility sought bankruptcy in April and filed a reorganization plan on Sept Edison Internationals Southern California Edison utility plans to pay off its creditors by March under a settlement it reached with the CPUC WHOLESALE INCOME NEARLY DOUBLES Dynegy Marketing and Trade the companys main wholesale business reported an percent yearoveryear increase in recurring net income taking in million this year compared with million in the comparable quarter in Among other things Dynegy trades wholesale natural gas power coal emission allowances and weather derivatives The company attributed part of its improved performance this quarter to better results in European and Canadian operations including increased gas marketing in Canada North American natural gas volumes grew percent to billion cubic feet per day Bcfd in the quarter rising from Bcfd in the yearearlier period Total physical power sales increased percent to million megawatt hours MWh in the third quarter compared with million MWh in the same quarter a year ago Dynegydirect the companys online trading platform for more than products and services recorded nearly billion in transactions in the third quarter the company said Since its birth in November Dynegydirect has recorded billion in transactions Dynegy recently expanded the platform its answer to hometown rival Enron Corps wildly successful EnronOnline trading platform into British energy markets One nominally lower performer this year was Illinois Power Dynegys regulated transmission and distribution subsidiary It reported recurring net income of million versus million a year earlier Dynegy attributed the smaller figure to a reduced industrial load The companys new communications segment took a million loss for the quarter mostly from costs associated with developing its mile network The network reaches US cities and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter Dynegy expects that segment to record a fourthquarter loss of nil to cents a share and a fullyear loss of cents to cents a share

Transportation as a commodity Transportation as a commodity By BILL HENSEL JR JoC Week Copyright c The Journal of Commerce Inc All Rights Reserved Enron Corp the Houstonbased energy giant is familiar with commodity markets In addition to energy the business for which it is best known Enron is the worlds largest metals trader The company also understands transportation It ships products as diverse as coal steel forest products and project cargo Now Enron is proposing to change the face of overtheroad trucking and domestic intermodal services by treating them as a commodity that can be bought and sold like any other product The companys Enron Freight Markets unit promises to help shippers and carriers manage risks associated with fluctuating diesel fuel prices and other shipping costs Enron will quote a set rate for docktodock moves and guarantee the service promised in the contract Enron Freight Markets was created in March to develop a market for freight capacity and to buy and sell spot and forward capacity in transportation As in other futures markets such as soybeans or pork bellies a buyer of a contract would have the option of taking delivery of the service or closing out his position Enron has successfully used similar formulas to create markets in energy Can it do the same with trucking and intermodal freight capacity Barry Parker a consultant for BDP Consulting Ltd which specializes in freight economics said it could work but that transportation isnt like other markets The marketplace needs these things but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to them Parker said I applaud what they are doing but it is an uphill battle Enron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of Webmodal a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and logistics services for carriers shippers and service providers The former Webmodal office in Chicago houses Enron Freights hour customer service and operations center This summer Enron took another step by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major trucking companies Enron said it recently signed its first firm sales contract with a major shipper but declined to identify it Dan Reck vice president of Enron Freight Markets said the company can offer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are considerably different from any others What Enron Freight Markets is trying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the freight market Reck said A key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and conditions The standardized areas would include specific delivery times and specific consequences for nonperformance Fixedprice contracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges spikes in shipping volumes and fluctuating carrier rates Enron said it can do that not only because it has deep pockets to make the market liquid but also by using its technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having customers sign longterm contracts What ends up happening is that the obligations of both parties becomes much more clean and predictable Reck said So from a carriers perspective they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece of their business There are very clean operational parameters We are also trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and conditions Enron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural gas and electricpower markets and is trying to change the way other markets such as steel are structured EFM sees transportation as another commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or speculation We are kind of commodityagnostic Reck explained We dont care what the commodity is we just sell capacity Enrons approach differs significantly from others that have entered the trucking field as technologybased intermediaries NTE the former National Transportation Exchange puts buyers and sellers directly together while Logisticscom uses the contracting process to identify the most costeffective matches between shippers and carriers Unlike the online services Enron contracts directly with the party involved and does not wait for two to be matched up on its website Under Enrons ideal contract damages for nonperformance are spelled out explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers must be able to bank on the reliability of the contract For example suppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of per mile for a shipment of freight between Atlanta and Chicago If Enron does not provide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the carrier can find is cents per mile Enron pays the difference The same process would work in reverse If the carrier promised to provide a truck and didnt Enron would provide a replacement at a higher price and the trucker would have to make up the difference Reck said the standardized contract would not be dictated by Enron but would evolve through negotiations or public forums Efforts are under way to introduce the company to shippers carriers and other intermediaries Enron officials say theyve talked with to shippers since March One goal is to persuade an independent group such as a trucking association or committee of marketplace participants to sponsor a forum for negotiations which the company believes would add legitimacy In its first contract Enron is acting as a carrier since the shipper already was working with a thirdparty logistics provider Enron considers itself distinct from PLs It focuses on docktodock moves and leaves supplychain optimization to others Its aim is to allow parties to minimize risk for example by giving shippers the ability to hedge against the possibility of diesel passthrough fees Enron is an extensive user of the Internet however and last year launched EnronOnline for traders to trade natural gas oil electricity and various other commodities online No one expects Enrons new freight capacity product to capture immediate acceptance Even Enron acknowledges that acceptance will be slow Reck said it will take time to overcome cultural resistance to change in the freight industry and that Enron is prepared for that We have done that in every market we have gotten into Reck said What we find is the economic benefits of doing business this way overpowers resistance over time You have to show what the benefits are JOCO c Copyright The Journal of Commerce Inc All Rights Reserved Folder Name Rahil Jafry Relevance Score on Scale of To review or revise your folder visit or contact

South By Peter Eavis mailto Senior Columnist PM EDT URL marketsdetoxhtml Enron ENENYSE news commentary appears to be relying on asset sales to offset weakness in its highprofile energy trading operation A billiondollar sale of power plants likely made a hefty contribution to the energy giants secondquarter profits which are supposed to owe their rapid growth to the companys wellpublicized trading acumen A smaller sale of impaired assets to an affiliate company also may have helped nudge secondquarter numbers past Wall Street earnings estimates One energy market source alleges the price tag on this deal was inflated Complicating matters Enrons financials make it difficult to determine exactly how much these deals may have contributed to earnings For its part Enron flatly denies that it used onetime gains to meet estimates or that the price of the impairedassets sale was inflated But dependence on asset sales would mark a big step backwards for Houstonbased Enron which has long told investors that trading is its future By shrewdly capturing a dominant position in the nations fastgrowing energy market Enron has expanded trading profits exponentially over the last couple of years Operating earnings from trading surged in to billion causing the stock to double Now theres chatter that Enrons swashbuckling traders were caught out by the second quarters unexpected drop in the prices of power and other energy commodities In addition the company booked a large loss in its broadband unit If asset sales cant be repeated and trading income weakens earnings could crater observers say which could pull Enrons already battered stock down even lower In fact fear that Enrons prodigious profits growth wont be sustained is the chief reason its stock price has dropped by half this year Other factors have contributed as well Investor dissatisfaction over Enrons opaque and confusing financial statements have risen throughout the year and earlier this month CEO Jeff Skilling quit after only six months on the job Skillings departure sparked all sorts of dark theories about the real reason for his sudden move Enron Chairman Ken Lay who has now reassumed the CEO post said this week that he aims to improve Enrons disclosure He has moved to allay concerns over toplevel instability by promoting two experienced Enron executives to the positions of president also vacated by Skilling and vice chairman But skeptics remain unconvinced I think the secondquarter performance was bad in the trading operations and was covered up by asset sales says Mark Roberts director of research at Off Wall Street a Cambridge Massbased stock analysis firm that doesnt do underwriting Off Wall Street issued a critical report on Enron in May For the quarter Enron made cents a share cents more than analysts had expected Details Details One transaction investors want details on is the sale by Enron North America of three gasfired power plants to Allegheny Energy Supply a unit of Allegheny Energy AYENYSE news commentary Hagerstown Md The deal took place in May for a price of billion according to Alleghenys recent Securities and Exchange Commission disclosures Allegheny declined to comment on the deal Enrons secondquarter earnings got a huge boost from the sale of these three socalled peaker plants says Roberts He believes the gain on the sale may have been as high as million An energy company analyst at a Wall Street brokerage thinks it may have been closer to million His firm hasnt done recent underwriting for Enron Enrons financial statements dont specify the size of the gain from the peakers so called because they supply power when demand is strong The company declines to offer a number saying the gain figure is hard to isolate because it must be netted against gains or losses on contracts associated with the assets sold However Enrons public disclosure states that proceeds from the sale are included in its commodity salesandservices line which is by far the biggest contributor to Enrons earnings producing million in operating profits in the second quarter The problem is that the firms trading profits also are booked in this segment As a result investors cant know how much of the quarters blowout commodity salesandservices earnings came from the peaker sale and how much from straight trading If Roberts million estimate is correct trading may have accounted for only million in secondquarter operating profit Partners Indeed The other deal thats raising eyebrows is the sale in June by Enron of Texasbased assets that are used to produce MTBE methyl tertiarybutyl ether the chemical compound added to gasoline to make it burn more efficiently The assets were sold for million by one subsidiary of Enron to another subsidiary called EOTT Energy Partners EOTNYSE news commentary chiefly a marketer and transporter of crude oil Any gain on the sale would have been booked in Enrons wholesale line The issues with the deal are plenty It took place on June right at the end of the second quarter This could be construed as a sign that Enron pressed EOTT to do the deal then so it could include any gain in secondquarter results Then theres the question of price Enron took a million impairment charge against these MTBE assets at the end of responding to what it described at the time as significant changes in state and federal rules regarding the use of MTBE Some environmental authorities believe MTBE to be a dangerous substance and claim the MTBE content in drinking water has reached unacceptably high levels Skeptics ask How can Enron turn around months after a massive impairment charge and sell the assets for million In addition an executive at another energy company that talked to Enron about buying the MTBE assets claims theyre worth million at most he claims Enron has long been trying to sell them for around million Put bluntly did Enron stuff EOTT with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectations An Enron spokeswoman responds EOTT views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business It makes good business sense And a recent EOTT SEC disclosure states that EOTTs audit committee made up of three directors who arent employees or officers of any Enron affiliate as well as an investment bank judged the sale price to be fair However the chairman of the audit committee Daniel Whitty is a director for two other Enron subsidiaries He declined to comment on the deal A person familiar with Enrons business adds that it was EOTT that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in thirdquarter numbers This person also says the gain was immaterial to Enrons secondquarter numbers since there wasnt a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold Most important this person insists the million price isnt based only on the assets sold EOTT is also paying for a contract with Enron that gives EOTT years worth of MTBErelated business Whats more Enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in MTBE production this person states Whatever the case with the MTBE assets Enron would go a long way toward fulfilling Lays promises of glasnost by breaking out assetsale gains They need to put their disclosure where their mouth is concludes Off

Bryson Hull Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited HOUSTON April Reuters The teflon around energy and trading powerhouse Enron Corp is starting to show some scratches as negative events over the past few months from India to its broadband unit begin to take their toll analysts say Make no mistake Wall Street still sees the Houstonbased giant as the energy convergence sector leader Analysts polled by Thomson FinancialFirst Call still believe Enron will meet its earnings per share targets of for But the stock has dropped to its lowest levels since late a slide which started with news that Enrons keystone broadband content deal with Blockbuster Inc had fallen apart The stock had traded in the mids as recently as February before the stock markets recent collapse and a string of negative news On Friday it traded at on the New York Stock Exchange down cents or percent and well off its high of last August Their share price hasnt been bulletproof and thats what counts They were up pushing and theyre now in the s while the energy sector has done quite well so they have underperformed quite a bit and that doesnt seem bulletproof to me analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities said Meade said the price fall came as investors took the bad news out of Enrons valuation particularly in devaluing the broadband business With broadband the market initially gave them full credit But investors got smart over the next year and once you got some bad news out there you could argue that valuation was pulled Meade said But the bad news neither starts nor ends there The latest negative item came Wednesday when a California federal judge ordered Enron to return the University of California and California State University systems to direct power access which Enron says will cost them million a month The universities lawsuit which claimed Enron Energy Services breached their power management contract could cast a shadow over the Houstonbased companys power risk management arm which recently saw a huge upsurge in business involving similar multimillion dollar deals with large corporations Other bad news includes broadband layoff talk failed water company spinoff Azurix Incs impending selloff its North American assets the failure of the video on demand deal with Blockbuster word that the billion sale of utility Portland General is unlikely to go through and continuing payment problems at the Dabhol power plant in India That longrunning dispute in India reared its head again on Monday Enron confirmed it issued a notice of political force majeure to the Maharashstra State Electricity Board MSEB which has consistently defaulted on payments Force majeure is an event beyond the control of a contractual party that could not have been prevented Its one of the steps in the process of protecting our rights Its one step but its not the only step Enron spokesman John Ambler said Enron has already invoked payment guarantees from the Indian national government but it has refused to cover MSEBs million December bill until Enron and MSEB settle another dispute over a fine The MSEB wants the million fine which it levied to cover its outstanding bills LAYOFFS OR REDEPLOYMENTS Another nettling problem for Enron is news of trouble at Enron Broadband Services EBS the cuttingedge unit that encompasses a nascent bandwidth trading operation and a broadband content services business Most recently Enron has had to answer questions about a reduction in the number of employees at EBS because of the stock markets faltering confidence in telecoms generally Two weeks ago the company characterized word of layoffs at the broadband unit as nothing more than an internal redeployment of staff to areas that were growing at a higher rate Its word games Initially they said they were redeploying and that was not the word I heard from inside the company but that was the way they put it Its probably a little of both said analyst John Olson of Houston investment house Sanders Morris Harris EBS spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly on Monday said employees were leaving the broadband unit to work in other areas of the company Most of them have elected to go into the redeployment pool or are already moved into corporate or another business Kimberly said Kimberly did not have an exact figure on the number who have opted to take a severance package but characterized it as a small percentage It has been a rough few weeks for EBS which also suffered from the Blockbuster debacle Last month the two announced a mutual end to a year

share from million or cents per diluted share for the same period in This represented a percent increase from Q and boosted the c ompanys earnings estimate Dynegy has a market capitalization of billion Its stock is currently trading at about down from a week high of although it is important to note that for yearend the co mpanys stock was one of the top performers among Standard Poors com panies with a total shareholder return of percent Dynegy employs people Enron Corp NYSE ENE reported million in losses for the third quart er after taking billion in charges associated with several of its no ncore businesses The companys Q recurring net income before the write offs increased percent to million or cents a diluted share an d revenue in the quarter rose to billion from billion in Q Enron has a market capitalization of billion Its stock is currently trading at about which represents a sixyear low for the company an d is considerably lower than the peak of hit in August Enron empl oys people Analysis Dynegy closed out a banner year in and appears to still be o n a roll in terms of its financial performance In contrast Enron faced an unprecedented year of turmoil and is presently languishing in a low ebb characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the comp anys financial reporting While the two companies operate in the same mark et space of power trading and are fierce competitors Dynegyironically the younger and smaller of the two companiesis an industry success story whil e Enrons status remains rather uncertain The questions to be addressed in this article are What is Dynegy doing right What is Enron doing wrong What lessons can other power and naturalgas marketers learn from this tale of two companies Although they are often referred to as crosstown rivals Dynegy and Enro n are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions Their divergent approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the singlem ost important element related to their disparate positions at the end of Put more simply the two companies have vastly different strategies an dhindsight being a strong argument can be made that Dynegys strateg y is the winner at this juncture Throughout this article I will focus on two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically Those two key areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to whi ch the companies have expanded and invested into noncore sectors Both companies started out as naturalgas companies and converged into the power market in the s However that is essentially where their similar ities end and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decid edly different paths In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary let me summarize the two paths this way Enron does not believe it needs t o own physical assets to be a success in the power and naturalgas trading sector Dynegy on the other hand not only believes in the ownership of ph ysical assets but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the compa ny as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry Lets look at the companies separately Well discuss Enron first since it is the older of the two Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficul t to define but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates comm odity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers The participation and success in commodity markets according to Enron does n ot necessitate ownership of physical assets In fact the company has routi nely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wh olesale business Rather Enron has concentrated on developing a new philos ophy of risk management excellence in which it will merely buy and sell th e commodities it needs to participate in trading venues As an example Enron bought Portland General which owns MW of genera tion and kilometers of electric TD lines in as a way to launc h its penetration of the West Coast power markets When competition fizzled in that region Enron put Portland General back on the sales block a sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing Like wise in Europe where it is one of the most prominent trading companies En ron has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and unlike other US competitors has refrained from buying additional genera ting units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy According to its most recent K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Enron owns or controls MW of generating capacity including joint own erships which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector Dynegys approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different fr om Enrons In the words of CEO Chuck Watson Dynegys longterm strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets which supports earnings sustainability Ever since going public in Dynegy has been on an acquisition binge with each purchase significantly increasing its g eneration capability Dynegy presently owns or controls about MW of generating capacity in the United States gasprocessing plants and miles of pipelines which are located in geographically competitive area s The companys goal is to own or control MW or percent of the US market within the next five years Sometimes Dynegy has acquired ass ets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy but just as often it has purchased assets independently Most notably when Dynegy a cquired Illinova in early the purchase doubled Dynegys generating ca pacity Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe wher e it is presently planning to purchase naturalgas storage facilities in En gland Dynegy executives have argued that naturalgas storage is the best w ay to back up a naturalgas trading operation Theres no question that the approach is working Out of the million that Dynegy reported in the t hird quarter million of it came from the companys main wholesale bus iness The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference be tween Enron and Dynegy and its significance should not be overlooked It i s not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegys approach Owning phys ical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the cour se of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price In other words by controlling the actu al output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells a trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region how much power can be produced to meet that load a nd when shortages might occur In addition in markets that are short on in frastructure it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region By t he same token those companies that do control physical assets often have g reater communication with grid operators and possible insight to spreads the difference between various energy prices In fact Dynegys CEO Watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around t he volatility of price and being capable of resolving balances when shorta ges exist This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomp lish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids Dynegys strategy of acquiring both naturalgas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities On the other side of this argument a case could be made that Enrons appro ach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility Certainly by investing less in power generation facilities Enron has less capital o n the line when compared to a company like Dynegy Under a scenario when ma rket prices suddenly drop a company such as Enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an as setladen company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixe d payments of a generation facility Assetheavy companies also may find th at their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilit ies in times of extreme price volatility As the industry becomes increasin gly focused on bottomline results this could be seen as a potential conce rn for investors Further some would argue that Enrons approach of establ ishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell r equirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility What E nron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own po rtfolio Consequently the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the g reat debate among power traders However although Dynegys overall perfor mance in the third quarter was better than Enrons that does not necessari ly provide a clear endorsement of Dynegys strategy toward acquiring new ge neration facilities Keep in mind that Enrons Q losses resulted primarily from nonrecurring charges related to its noncore businesses broadband a nd water in particular Without these charges Enrons core wholesale trad ing business continues to perform well This is a point that CEO Ken Lay ha s been quick to reiterate to investors Our percent increase in recurri ng earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core who lesale and retail energy businesses and our naturalgas pipelines Lay sai d The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enrons leadi ng market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook Moreover perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets the key issu e that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earn ings in the third quarter is the companies approach to developing new line s of business Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point Enron which prides itself as usually gaining a firststrike advantage plunged i nto the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies Under the lead ership of thenCEO Jeffrey Skilling Enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quic kly become lucrative Now Lay admits that the company could have gotten in to the broadband business with less capital and that Enron spent too much too soon in this sector Nevertheless Enron recorded an million non recurring writedown for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quar ter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by redu cing future costs in this sector to million a quarter Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared t o Enron Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom s ector but in the third quarter took a million loss in its broadband bu siness compared to the million loss that Enron reported However Dyneg y clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities electricity and natural gas and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical wa y that merely supplements its core business It is also important to note that Enron gained the firststrike advantage w hen it developed EnronOnline an electronic trading exchange In fact Enro n was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space well ahead of its competitors Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydi rect The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was s uccessful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline ha s recorded transactions that exceed in notional value Since its incep tion in November Dynegydirect has recorded billion in notional tr ansactions At this juncture Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting Enron which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enrons CFO To my rec ollection no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet and thus the companys status with investors is arguably more solid As I dont expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon my projection is that at least in the near term we will cont inue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and Enron That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game A s noted the companys core business of wholesale business remains strong but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other noncore businesses Th at doesnt mean Enron is down permanently but it will have to find a way t o strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and thos e businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous In many ways the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the to rtoise and the hare parable I am sure you can guess which company is the t ortoise and which is the hare in this analogy The race between the two is far from over although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point based on i ts more methodical approach What will be fascinating to observe is how bot h companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly mo dify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies

rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters Enron Corp NYSE ENE stock sustained further he avy losses on October as investor confidence in the former Wall Street f avorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years The energy giants stock was off or percent a t per share at midday trade on Oct making a cumulative loss of percent for a week in which it reported a thirdquarter loss of mi llion As of early morning trading on Oct Enron shares were priced at a reflection of new developments including a new Securities and Ex change inquiry that have caused uncertainty about the company among invest ors Analysis Enrons first financial report since the departure of former CEO Jeffrey Skilling in August has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory While Skilling cited personal reasons for his depa rture many analysts suspected that a significant drop in Enrons share pri ce and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role A t the time of Skillings departure Enrons stock had tumbled to a week low However based on the new Q report it now appears that Enrons downw ard turn may be continuing despite the return of Kenneth Lay to the company s top spot In essence Enrons financial problems have been caused by bus inesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its cor e focus on wholesale power sales It appears that Enron is learning a costl y lessonnamely that investors are not responding favorably to the company s innovation especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromis ed The road ahead may remain uncertain for Enron as a good number of unre solved issues and a new Securities and Exchange Commission SEC inquiry in to financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company Lets first establish the financial losses that Enron has reported in the t hird quarter As noted as a whole the company reported million in los ses after taking billion in charges associated with several of its n oncore businesses When we break down the losses it becomes clear that En ron is struggling with its operations in three businesses water broadband and the retail power market Specifically Enron reported million in charges from Azurix its water and wastewater business million in cha rges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations including sever ance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts and million in what the company is calling investment losses Evidently abou t half of the million figure is related to Enrons investment in NewPo wer Company the retail electricity and naturalgas provider that Enron lau nched about two years ago with partners America Online and IBM Enron owns percent of NewPower In addition Enrons debt to total capitalization r atio reportedly will increase to about percent although Lay says that p ending asset sales may reduce that amount to percent by the end of However it is important to note that Enrons Q recurring net income bef ore the writeoffs did increase percent to million or cents a diluted share and revenue in the quarter rose to billion from bi llion in Q The losses associated with NewPower are particularly interesting As one of the leading investors in the company Enron drove NewPowers aggressive bu siness focus on retail residential power sales despite ongoing concerns ab out the development of retail competition across the United States NewPowe r went public last year at an opening price of and in the early days o f its initial public offering was trading above that price However the co mpanys stock has experienced a devastating drop in value and is currently priced at NewPower is not scheduled to release its own Q financial statement until early November but it is expected that the company will c ontinue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future Specificall y NewPower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a Q loss of million to million or to a share Thirdquarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the million to million that the company had forecast in August In analyzing NewPowers Q financial losses see IssueAlert from at wwwscientechcomrci IssueAlert I argu ed that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negativ e factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in re sidential and small business markets in the United States On the positive side NewPower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from AES Corp and DTE Energy These purchases prompted an impressive growth sp urt for NewPower and the company reportedly now has a customer base in markets in states However the bad news for NewPower is that its losses continue to widen apparently resulting from a combination of weather fact ors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the compa ny operates This dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better and t he companys stock has continued to drop as a result In an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes NewPower recently rev ised an existing master netting agreement with Enron Corp and several of i ts subsidiaries The revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cas h collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron subsidiaries th rough Jan With the lowered financial obligations that it must mak e to Enron NewPower believes that it will have sufficient financial resour ces to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset based financing However from Enrons perspective the losses associated with NewPower and by the same token the losses in water and broadband have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price The message is clear The businesses that Enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole Further what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on Enrons p art has not translated into measurable profits and consequently Wall Stree t has reacted by sending Enrons stock to a level that is about half of whe re it was a year ago The individual sectors that Enron has pursued are all unique but they share the common denominator of taking Enron away from wh at was a successful core business Further they are similar in that Enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which i t arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth The problem with Enron s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of f iberoptic lines which has prevented the demand for the divisions service s from materializing as anticipated The problem with Azurix which has bee n losing money since its formation in is that privatization of the wa ter sector has not materialized as quickly as Enron and other companies ant icipated In addition to these problem areas Enron also faces challenges r elated to its investments in India where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government and California from which Enron has yet to rece ive full payment for previous power sales In addition to the losses outlined in the Q report there are new issues t hat are brewing at the start of this week First the SEC has requested tha t Enron provide information regarding certain related party transactions Not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry However it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns relate d to the dealings of Enrons Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from E nron Ken Lay has said that Enron will cooperate fully with the SECs reque st In a separate development several mutual funds including AIM Constell ation that once held large positions in Enron have either liquidated or re duced their holdings in the company which has further weakened Enrons sto ck value Portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about Enrons ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader The present challenge for Enron is to convince investors that the company r emains on solid ground despite the losses Thus Lay has been quick to reit erate that earnings from the companys energy and gaspipeline business are still strong Further Lay says that the charges reported in the third qua rter should be seen as a way to clear away issues that have clouded the pe rformance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses Neverthele ss the fact remains that Enron has invested huge amounts of money toward i ts diversification effort and in addition to water and broadband the compa ny has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well Thus se veral questions remain at this juncture Are the losses reported in the thi rd quarter only a temporary setback for Enron that will clear the way for t he company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trad ing Or will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and Moving forward will Enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably On ly time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at En ron which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We look forward to hearing from you Nancy

HOUSTON CBSMW In the wake of the Sept terrorist attacks one of the few places to buy or sell jet fuel was an online market maintained by Enron The attacks highlighted the Houston companys strength as a manager of risk during periods of heightened uncertainty Through its trading centers the company gives customers a way to hedge against volatility in oil natural gas and electricity markets as well as other commodities Although the company lost one employee aboard one of the hijacked planes and closed its operations on the day of the attacks its trading activity resumed the next day By coming back online so fast we made the decision to provide some stability in the market said Vance Meyer an Enron spokesman The customers really appreciated the fact that we were there providing a place for them to maintain and adjust their positions in the market In a financial sense Enron ENE didnt suffer Meyer said But employees at the Enron Building in downtown Houston were badly shaken Nick Humber who worked for Enrons wind energy business died aboard a Los Angeles bound flight that crashed into the World Trade Center We have offices in Washington and New York and people who had friends that died or were affected in some way Meyer said We also had traders who were on the phone with people in the World Trade Center when the planes hit The decision to temporarily halt commodity trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the wake of the attacks may have increased volatility a boon to the group said Bob Christensen analyst at FACEquities Companies that can defray volatility by helping customers manage their energy costs should be seeing a lot of business he said Managing risk is what Enron does best market players say And that strength should help the company going forward as US businesses try to recover from the impact of September Through its EnronOnline platform the company buys and sells commodities at volumes totaling about billion a day Meyer said The world at large has become more risk averse and Enron which is in the business of risk mitigation should benefit from that said Glen Hilton senior analyst and portfolio manager for the Montgomery New Power Fund which has a stake in Enron With energy risk and prices potentially going up theyll be the first number on many CFOs speed dial Other companies do what Enron does but its the best positioned to succeed because of its status as the leader in natural gas and power trading measured in terms of volume Duke Energy DUK is the nextlargest competitor but it has onethird of Enrons volume High profile departure Thats a good place to be for a company whose stock price has been on the skids since last year though it grew percent on the top line in Other problems notwithstanding including its moneylosing broadband business and its failure to sell the Oregon utility Portland General Electric Enrons largest black eye came in midAugust when Jeffrey Skilling chief executive since February resigned abruptly John Hammerschmidt senior portfolio manager of the Turner New Energy and Power Technology Fund said he freaked out when Skilling left and managers immediately divested the Turner largecap portfolios of Enron holdings Despite its status as a growth player Turner had reentered the stock in June after a long absence because of valuation At the time Enron was trading in the mid to high s This is a premier company and a premier industry he said adding that he believed then that the market had priced rumors into the stock One of the rumors was that Enron was about to take a big loss from being long on power when power prices were collapsing Hammerschmidt said That has not materialized Whatever the problems were Hammerschmidt said he felt them to be manageable When Skilling walked out Hammerschmidt began to believe some of the rumors might be true In our experience when somebody in power leaves for no reason theres uncertainty and uncertainty makes growth guys real nervous he said Management continuity Now hes looking to get back in Enron he said works in both down and up markets Enrons earnings are more solid today than theyve ever beenand theyre valuable because were becoming a digital economy he said We need highquality power and local power plants have trouble providing reliability Enron is focused on guaranteeing people quality power in times of stress on the system Of course theres still the issue about trusting management After Skilling left Enron promoted Greg Whalley to president and chief operating officer and Mark Frevert to vice chairman You cannot expect Whalley and Frevert to articulate the Enron vision the way Jeffrey did Christensen said They may grow into it On the upside Skilling predecessor Ken Lay who Wall Street credits with building Enron into a powerhouse is back at the helm and he has promised to remain at the post until a solid succession plan is in place We have a great deal of confidence in Mr Ken Lay as he was the original architect of ENEs and for that matter the entire industrys tremendous transformation for the past decade Merrill Lynch stated in a research report the day after Skilling left Enron Whats more Ken Lay has promised more transparency at Enron more insight into how the company makes money which will help Hilton said Trying to forecast Enrons earnings is difficult Christensen said that a lack of data and clarity in regard to Enrons wholesale operations has been an issue in the past Enron has promised to provide more information when it reports its thirdquarter results on October Ultimately only time will assuage investors concerns But with the prospects that Enron has the stock is a deal right now Hammerschmidt said I dont know what gets people back but buy Enron at

By Peter Eavis mailto Senior Columnist PM EDT URL marketsdetoxhtml Enron ENENYSE news commentary appears to be relying on asset sales to offset weakness in its highprofile energy trading operation A billiondollar sale of power plants likely made a hefty contribution to the energy giants secondquarter profits which are supposed to owe their rapid growth to the companys wellpublicized trading acumen A smaller sale of impaired assets to an affiliate company also may have helped nudge secondquarter numbers past Wall Street earnings estimates One energy market source alleges the price tag on this deal was inflated Complicating matters Enrons financials make it difficult to determine exactly how much these deals may have contributed to earnings For its part Enron flatly denies that it used onetime gains to meet estimates or that the price of the impairedassets sale was inflated But dependence on asset sales would mark a big step backwards for Houstonbased Enron which has long told investors that trading is its future By shrewdly capturing a dominant position in the nations fastgrowing energy market Enron has expanded trading profits exponentially over the last couple of years Operating earnings from trading surged in to billion causing the stock to double Now theres chatter that Enrons swashbuckling traders were caught out by the second quarters unexpected drop in the prices of power and other energy commodities In addition the company booked a large loss in its broadband unit If asset sales cant be repeated and trading income weakens earnings could crater observers say which could pull Enrons already battered stock down even lower In fact fear that Enrons prodigious profits growth wont be sustained is the chief reason its stock price has dropped by half this year Other factors have contributed as well Investor dissatisfaction over Enrons opaque and confusing financial statements have risen throughout the year and earlier this month CEO Jeff Skilling quit after only six months on the job Skillings departure sparked all sorts of dark theories about the real reason for his sudden move Enron Chairman Ken Lay who has now reassumed the CEO post said this week that he aims to improve Enrons disclosure He has moved to allay concerns over toplevel instability by promoting two experienced Enron executives to the positions of president also vacated by Skilling and vice chairman But skeptics remain unconvinced I think the secondquarter performance was bad in the trading operations and was covered up by asset sales says Mark Roberts director of research at Off Wall Street a Cambridge Massbased stock analysis firm that doesnt do underwriting Off Wall Street issued a critical report on Enron in May For the quarter Enron made cents a share cents more than analysts had expected Details Details One transaction investors want details on is the sale by Enron North America of three gasfired power plants to Allegheny Energy Supply a unit of Allegheny Energy AYENYSE news commentary Hagerstown Md The deal took place in May for a price of billion according to Alleghenys recent Securities and Exchange Commission disclosures Allegheny declined to comment on the deal Enrons secondquarter earnings got a huge boost from the sale of these three socalled peaker plants says Roberts He believes the gain on the sale may have been as high as million An energy company analyst at a Wall Street brokerage thinks it may have been closer to million His firm hasnt done recent underwriting for Enron Enrons financial statements dont specify the size of the gain from the peakers so called because they supply power when demand is strong The company declines to offer a number saying the gain figure is hard to isolate because it must be netted against gains or losses on contracts associated with the assets sold However Enrons public disclosure states that proceeds from the sale are included in its commodity salesandservices line which is by far the biggest contributor to Enrons earnings producing million in operating profits in the second quarter The problem is that the firms trading profits also are booked in this segment As a result investors cant know how much of the quarters blowout commodity salesandservices earnings came from the peaker sale and how much from straight trading If Roberts million estimate is correct trading may have accounted for only million in secondquarter operating profit Partners Indeed The other deal thats raising eyebrows is the sale in June by Enron of Texasbased assets that are used to produce MTBE methyl tertiarybutyl ether the chemical compound added to gasoline to make it burn more efficiently The assets were sold for million by one subsidiary of Enron to another subsidiary called EOTT Energy Partners EOTNYSE news commentary chiefly a marketer and transporter of crude oil Any gain on the sale would have been booked in Enrons wholesale line The issues with the deal are plenty It took place on June right at the end of the second quarter This could be construed as a sign that Enron pressed EOTT to do the deal then so it could include any gain in secondquarter results Then theres the question of price Enron took a million impairment charge against these MTBE assets at the end of responding to what it described at the time as significant changes in state and federal rules regarding the use of MTBE Some environmental authorities believe MTBE to be a dangerous substance and claim the MTBE content in drinking water has reached unacceptably high levels Skeptics ask How can Enron turn around months after a massive impairment charge and sell the assets for million In addition an executive at another energy company that talked to Enron about buying the MTBE assets claims theyre worth million at most he claims Enron has long been trying to sell them for around million Put bluntly did Enron stuff EOTT with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectations An Enron spokeswoman responds EOTT views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business It makes good business sense And a recent EOTT SEC disclosure states that EOTTs audit committee made up of three directors who arent employees or officers of any Enron affiliate as well as an investment bank judged the sale price to be fair However the chairman of the audit committee Daniel Whitty is a director for two other Enron subsidiaries He declined to comment on the deal A person familiar with Enrons business adds that it was EOTT that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in thirdquarter numbers This person also says the gain was immaterial to Enrons secondquarter numbers since there wasnt a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold Most important this person insists the million price isnt based only on the assets sold EOTT is also paying for a contract with Enron that gives EOTT years worth of MTBErelated business Whats more Enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in MTBE production this person states Whatever the case with the MTBE assets Enron would go a long way toward fulfilling Lays promises of glasnost by breaking out assetsale gains They need to put their disclosure where their mouth is concludes Off Wall Streets Roberts Know any companies that the market may be misvaluing Detox would like to hear about them Please send all feedback to mailto In keeping with TSCs editorial policy Peter Eavis

Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg Facts Dynegy Inc NYSE DYN beat expectations in the third quarter repo rting that its earnings rose to million or cents per diluted share from million or cents per diluted share for the same period in This represented a percent increase from Q and boosted the c ompanys earnings estimate Dynegy has a market capitalization of billion Its stock is currently trading at about down from a week high of although it is important to note that for yearend the co mpanys stock was one of the top performers among Standard Poors com panies with a total shareholder return of percent Dynegy employs people Enron Corp NYSE ENE reported million in losses for the third quart er after taking billion in charges associated with several of its no ncore businesses The companys Q recurring net income before the write offs increased percent to million or cents a diluted share an d revenue in the quarter rose to billion from billion in Q Enron has a market capitalization of billion Its stock is currently trading at about which represents a sixyear low for the company an d is considerably lower than the peak of hit in August Enron empl oys people Analysis Dynegy closed out a banner year in and appears to still be o n a roll in terms of its financial performance In contrast Enron faced an unprecedented year of turmoil and is presently languishing in a low ebb characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the comp anys financial reporting While the two companies operate in the same mark et space of power trading and are fierce competitors Dynegyironically the younger and smaller of the two companiesis an industry success story whil e Enrons status remains rather uncertain The questions to be addressed in this article are What is Dynegy doing right What is Enron doing wrong What lessons can other power and naturalgas marketers learn from this tale of two companies Although they are often referred to as crosstown rivals Dynegy and Enro n are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions Their divergent approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the singlem ost important element related to their disparate positions at the end of Put more simply the two companies have vastly different strategies an dhindsight being a strong argument can be made that Dynegys strateg y is the winner at this juncture Throughout this article I will focus on two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically Those two key areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to whi ch the companies have expanded and invested into noncore sectors Both companies started out as naturalgas companies and converged into the power market in the s However that is essentially where their similar ities end and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decid edly different paths In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary let me summarize the two paths this way Enron does not believe it needs t o own physical assets to be a success in the power and naturalgas trading sector Dynegy on the other hand not only believes in the ownership of ph ysical assets but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the compa ny as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry Lets look at the companies separately Well discuss Enron first since it is the older of the two Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficul t to define but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates comm odity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers The participation and success in commodity markets according to Enron does n ot necessitate ownership of physical assets In fact the company has routi nely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wh olesale business Rather Enron has concentrated on developing a new philos ophy of risk management excellence in which it will merely buy and sell th e commodities it needs to participate in trading venues As an example Enron bought Portland General which owns MW of genera tion and kilometers of electric TD lines in as a way to launc h its penetration of the West Coast power markets When competition fizzled in that region Enron put Portland General back on the sales block a sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing Like wise in Europe where it is one of the most prominent trading companies En ron has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and unlike other US competitors has refrained from buying additional genera ting units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy According to its most recent K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Enron owns or controls MW of generating capacity including joint own erships which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector Dynegys approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different fr om Enrons In the words of CEO Chuck Watson Dynegys longterm strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets which supports earnings sustainability Ever since going public in Dynegy has been on an acquisition binge with each purchase significantly increasing its g eneration capability Dynegy presently owns or controls about MW of generating capacity in the United States gasprocessing plants and miles of pipelines which are located in geographically competitive area s The companys goal is to own or control MW or percent of the US market within the next five years Sometimes Dynegy has acquired ass ets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy but just as often it has purchased assets independently Most notably when Dynegy a cquired Illinova in early the purchase doubled Dynegys generating ca pacity Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe wher e it is presently planning to purchase naturalgas storage facilities in En gland Dynegy executives have argued that naturalgas storage is the best w ay to back up a naturalgas trading operation Theres no question that the approach is working Out of the million that Dynegy reported in the t hird quarter million of it came from the companys main wholesale bus iness The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference be tween Enron and Dynegy and its significance should not be overlooked It i s not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegys approach Owning phys ical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the cour se of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price In other words by controlling the actu al output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells a trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region how much power can be produced to meet that load a nd when shortages might occur In addition in markets that are short on in frastructure it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region By t he same token those companies that do control physical assets often have g reater communication with grid operators and possible insight to spreads the difference between various energy prices In fact Dynegys CEO Watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around t he volatility of price and being capable of resolving balances when shorta ges exist This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomp lish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids Dynegys strategy of acquiring both naturalgas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities On the other side of this argument a case could be made that Enrons appro ach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility Certainly by investing less in power generation facilities Enron has less capital o n the line when compared to a company like Dynegy Under a scenario when ma rket prices suddenly drop a company such as Enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an as setladen company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixe d payments of a generation facility Assetheavy companies also may find th at their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilit ies in times of extreme price volatility As the industry becomes increasin gly focused on bottomline results this could be seen as a potential conce rn for investors Further some would argue that Enrons approach of establ ishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell r equirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility What E nron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own po rtfolio Consequently the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the g reat debate among power traders However although Dynegys overall perfor mance in the third quarter was better than Enrons that does not necessari ly provide a clear endorsement of Dynegys strategy toward acquiring new ge neration facilities Keep in mind that Enrons Q losses resulted primarily from nonrecurring charges related to its noncore businesses broadband a nd water in particular Without these charges Enrons core wholesale trad ing business continues to perform well This is a point that CEO Ken Lay ha s been quick to reiterate to investors Our percent increase in recurri ng earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core who lesale and retail energy businesses and our naturalgas pipelines Lay sai d The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enrons leadi ng market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook Moreover perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets the key issu e that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earn ings in the third quarter is the companies approach to developing new line s of business Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point Enron which prides itself as usually gaining a firststrike advantage plunged i nto the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies Under the lead ership of thenCEO Jeffrey Skilling Enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quic kly become lucrative Now Lay admits that the company could have gotten in to the broadband business with less capital and that Enron spent too much too soon in this sector Nevertheless Enron recorded an million non recurring writedown for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quar ter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by redu cing future costs in this sector to million a quarter Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared t o Enron Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom s ector but in the third quarter took a million loss in its broadband bu siness compared to the million loss that Enron reported However Dyneg y clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities electricity and natural gas and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical wa y that merely supplements its core business It is also important to note that Enron gained the firststrike advantage w hen it developed EnronOnline an electronic trading exchange In fact Enro n was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space well ahead of its competitors Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydi rect The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was s uccessful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline ha s recorded transactions that exceed in notional value Since its incep tion in November Dynegydirect has recorded billion in notional tr ansactions At this juncture Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting Enron which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enrons CFO To my rec ollection no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet and thus the companys status with investors is arguably more solid As I dont expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon my projection is that at least in the near term we will cont inue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and Enron That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game A s noted the companys core business of wholesale business remains strong but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other noncore businesses Th at doesnt mean Enron is down permanently but it will have to find a way t o strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and thos e businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous In many ways the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the to rtoise and the hare parable I am sure you can guess which company is the t ortoise and which is the hare in this analogy The race between the two is far from over although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point based on i ts more methodical approach What will be fascinating to observe is how bot h companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly mo dify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies

rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters Enron Corp NYSE ENE stock sustained further he avy losses on October as investor confidence in the former Wall Street f avorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years The energy giants stock was off or percent a t per share at midday trade on Oct making a cumulative loss of percent for a week in which it reported a thirdquarter loss of mi llion As of early morning trading on Oct Enron shares were priced at a reflection of new developments including a new Securities and Ex change inquiry that have caused uncertainty about the company among invest ors Analysis Enrons first financial report since the departure of former CEO Jeffrey Skilling in August has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory While Skilling cited personal reasons for his depa rture many analysts suspected that a significant drop in Enrons share pri ce and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role A t the time of Skillings departure Enrons stock had tumbled to a week low However based on the new Q report it now appears that Enrons downw ard turn may be continuing despite the return of Kenneth Lay to the company s top spot In essence Enrons financial problems have been caused by bus inesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its cor e focus on wholesale power sales It appears that Enron is learning a costl y lessonnamely that investors are not responding favorably to the company s innovation especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromis ed The road ahead may remain uncertain for Enron as a good number of unre solved issues and a new Securities and Exchange Commission SEC inquiry in to financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company Lets first establish the financial losses that Enron has reported in the t hird quarter As noted as a whole the company reported million in los ses after taking billion in charges associated with several of its n oncore businesses When we break down the losses it becomes clear that En ron is struggling with its operations in three businesses water broadband and the retail power market Specifically Enron reported million in charges from Azurix its water and wastewater business million in cha rges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations including sever ance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts and million in what the company is calling investment losses Evidently abou t half of the million figure is related to Enrons investment in NewPo wer Company the retail electricity and naturalgas provider that Enron lau nched about two years ago with partners America Online and IBM Enron owns percent of NewPower In addition Enrons debt to total capitalization r atio reportedly will increase to about percent although Lay says that p ending asset sales may reduce that amount to percent by the end of However it is important to note that Enrons Q recurring net income bef ore the writeoffs did increase percent to million or cents a diluted share and revenue in the quarter rose to billion from bi llion in Q The losses associated with NewPower are particularly interesting As one of the leading investors in the company Enron drove NewPowers aggressive bu siness focus on retail residential power sales despite ongoing concerns ab out the development of retail competition across the United States NewPowe r went public last year at an opening price of and in the early days o f its initial public offering was trading above that price However the co mpanys stock has experienced a devastating drop in value and is currently priced at NewPower is not scheduled to release its own Q financial statement until early November but it is expected that the company will c ontinue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future Specificall y NewPower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a Q loss of million to million or to a share Thirdquarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the million to million that the company had forecast in August In analyzing NewPowers Q financial losses see IssueAlert from at wwwscientechcomrci IssueAlert I argu ed that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negativ e factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in re sidential and small business markets in the United States On the positive side NewPower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from AES Corp and DTE Energy These purchases prompted an impressive growth sp urt for NewPower and the company reportedly now has a customer base in markets in states However the bad news for NewPower is that its losses continue to widen apparently resulting from a combination of weather fact ors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the compa ny operates This dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better and t he companys stock has continued to drop as a result In an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes NewPower recently rev ised an existing master netting agreement with Enron Corp and several of i ts subsidiaries The revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cas h collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron subsidiaries th rough Jan With the lowered financial obligations that it must mak e to Enron NewPower believes that it will have sufficient financial resour ces to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset based financing However from Enrons perspective the losses associated with NewPower and by the same token the losses in water and broadband have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price The message is clear The businesses that Enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole Further what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on Enrons p art has not translated into measurable profits and consequently Wall Stree t has reacted by sending Enrons stock to a level that is about half of whe re it was a year ago The individual sectors that Enron has pursued are all unique but they share the common denominator of taking Enron away from wh at was a successful core business Further they are similar in that Enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which i t arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth The problem with Enron s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of f iberoptic lines which has prevented the demand for the divisions service s from materializing as anticipated The problem with Azurix which has bee n losing money since its formation in is that privatization of the wa ter sector has not materialized as quickly as Enron and other companies ant icipated In addition to these problem areas Enron also faces challenges r elated to its investments in India where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government and California from which Enron has yet to rece ive full payment for previous power sales In addition to the losses outlined in the Q report there are new issues t hat are brewing at the start of this week First the SEC has requested tha t Enron provide information regarding certain related party transactions Not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry However it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns relate d to the dealings of Enrons Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from E nron Ken Lay has said that Enron will cooperate fully with the SECs reque st In a separate development several mutual funds including AIM Constell ation that once held large positions in Enron have either liquidated or re duced their holdings in the company which has further weakened Enrons sto ck value Portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about Enrons ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader The present challenge for Enron is to convince investors that the company r emains on solid ground despite the losses Thus Lay has been quick to reit erate that earnings from the companys energy and gaspipeline business are still strong Further Lay says that the charges reported in the third qua rter should be seen as a way to clear away issues that have clouded the pe rformance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses Neverthele ss the fact remains that Enron has invested huge amounts of money toward i ts diversification effort and in addition to water and broadband the compa ny has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well Thus se veral questions remain at this juncture Are the losses reported in the thi rd quarter only a temporary setback for Enron that will clear the way for t he company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trad ing Or will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and Moving forward will Enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably On ly time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at En ron which is clearly a company in the midst of another

To Jafry Rahil Subject FW A Positive Note about Enron fyi From CBSMarketWatchcom online at newsstoryaspsiteIDyhooguidBAEDCADCDBDACD ATTACKS HIGHLIGHT ENRONS VALUE By Lisa Sanders AM ET Oct HOUSTON CBSMW In the wake of the Sept terrorist attacks one of the few places to buy or sell jet fuel was an online market maintained by Enron The attacks highlighted the Houston companys strength as a manager of risk during periods of heightened uncertainty Through its trading centers the company gives customers a way to hedge against volatility in oil natural gas and electricity markets as well as other commodities Although the company lost one employee aboard one of the hijacked planes and closed its operations on the day of the attacks its trading activity resumed the next day By coming back online so fast we made the decision to provide some stability in the market said Vance Meyer an Enron spokesman The customers really appreciated the fact that we were there providing a place for them to maintain and adjust their positions in the market In a financial sense Enron ENE didnt suffer Meyer said But employees at the Enron Building in downtown Houston were badly shaken Nick Humber who worked for Enrons wind energy business died aboard a Los Angeles bound flight that crashed into the World Trade Center We have offices in Washington and New York and people who had friends that died or were affected in some way Meyer said We also had traders who were on the phone with people in the World Trade Center when the planes hit The decision to temporarily halt commodity trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the wake of the attacks may have increased volatility a boon to the group said Bob Christensen analyst at FACEquities Companies that can defray volatility by helping customers manage their energy costs should be seeing a lot of business he said Managing risk is what Enron does best market players say And that strength should help the company going forward as US businesses try to recover from the impact of September Through its EnronOnline platform the company buys and sells commodities at volumes totaling about billion a day Meyer said The world at large has become more risk averse and Enron which is in the business of risk mitigation should benefit from that said Glen Hilton senior analyst and portfolio manager for the Montgomery New Power Fund which has a stake in Enron With energy risk and prices potentially going up theyll be the first number on many CFOs speed dial Other companies do what Enron does but its the best positioned to succeed because of its status as the leader in natural gas and power trading measured in terms of volume Duke Energy DUK is the nextlargest competitor but it has onethird of Enrons volume High profile departure Thats a good place to be for a company whose stock price has been on the skids since last year though it grew percent on the top line in Other problems notwithstanding including its moneylosing broadband business and its failure to sell the Oregon utility Portland General Electric Enrons largest black eye came in midAugust when Jeffrey Skilling chief executive since February resigned abruptly John Hammerschmidt senior portfolio manager of the Turner New Energy and Power Technology Fund said he freaked out when Skilling left and managers immediately divested the Turner largecap portfolios of Enron holdings Despite its status as a growth player Turner had reentered the stock in June after a long absence because of valuation At the time Enron was trading in the mid to high s This is a premier company and a premier industry he said adding that he believed then that the market had priced rumors into the stock One of the rumors was that Enron was about to take a big loss from being long on power when power prices were collapsing Hammerschmidt said That has not materialized Whatever the problems were Hammerschmidt said he felt them to be manageable When Skilling walked out Hammerschmidt began to believe some of the rumors might be true In our experience when somebody in power leaves for no reason theres uncertainty and uncertainty makes growth guys real nervous he said Management continuity Now hes looking to get back in Enron he said works in both down and up markets Enrons earnings are more solid today than theyve ever beenand theyre valuable because were becoming a digital economy he said We need highquality power and local power plants have trouble providing reliability Enron is focused on guaranteeing people quality power in times of stress on the system Of course theres still the issue about trusting management After Skilling left Enron promoted Greg Whalley to president and chief operating officer and Mark Frevert to vice chairman You cannot expect Whalley and Frevert to articulate the Enron vision the way Jeffrey did Christensen said They may grow into it On the upside Skilling predecessor Ken Lay who Wall Street credits with building Enron into a powerhouse is back at the helm and he has promised to remain at the post until a solid succession plan is in place We have a great deal of confidence in Mr Ken Lay as he was the original architect of ENEs and for that matter the entire industrys tremendous transformation for the past decade Merrill Lynch stated in a research report the day after Skilling left Enron Whats more Ken Lay has promised more transparency at Enron more insight into how the company makes money which will help Hilton said Trying to forecast Enrons earnings is difficult Christensen said that a lack of data and clarity in regard to Enrons wholesale operations has been an issue in the past Enron has promised to provide more information when it reports its thirdquarter results on October Ultimately only time will assuage investors concerns But with the prospects that Enron has the stock is a deal right now Hammerschmidt said I dont know what gets people back but buy Enron at and in a year youre making money he said I can see the stock getting back to in a blink

Transportation as a commodity Transportation as a commodity By BILL HENSEL JR JoC Week Copyright c The Journal of Commerce Inc All Rights Reserved Enron Corp the Houstonbased energy giant is familiar with commodity markets In addition to energy the business for which it is best known Enron is the worlds largest metals trader The company also understands transportation It ships products as diverse as coal steel forest products and project cargo Now Enron is proposing to change the face of overtheroad trucking and domestic intermodal services by treating them as a commodity that can be bought and sold like any other product The companys Enron Freight Markets unit promises to help shippers and carriers manage risks associated with fluctuating diesel fuel prices and other shipping costs Enron will quote a set rate for docktodock moves and guarantee the service promised in the contract Enron Freight Markets was created in March to develop a market for freight capacity and to buy and sell spot and forward capacity in transportation As in other futures markets such as soybeans or pork bellies a buyer of a contract would have the option of taking delivery of the service or closing out his position Enron has successfully used similar formulas to create markets in energy Can it do the same with trucking and intermodal freight capacity Barry Parker a consultant for BDP Consulting Ltd which specializes in freight economics said it could work but that transportation isnt like other markets The marketplace needs these things but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to them Parker said I applaud what they are doing but it is an uphill battle Enron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of Webmodal a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and logistics services for carriers shippers and service providers The former Webmodal office in Chicago houses Enron Freights hour customer service and operations center This summer Enron took another step by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major trucking companies Enron said it recently signed its first firm sales contract with a major shipper but declined to identify it Dan Reck vice president of Enron Freight Markets said the company can offer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are considerably different from any others What Enron Freight Markets is trying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the freight market Reck said A key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and conditions The standardized areas would include specific delivery times and specific consequences for nonperformance Fixedprice contracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges spikes in shipping volumes and fluctuating carrier rates Enron said it can do that not only because it has deep pockets to make the market liquid but also by using its technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having customers sign longterm contracts What ends up happening is that the obligations of both parties becomes much more clean and predictable Reck said So from a carriers perspective they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece of their business There are very clean operational parameters We are also trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and conditions Enron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural gas and electricpower markets and is trying to change the way other markets such as steel are structured EFM sees transportation as another commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or speculation We are kind of commodityagnostic Reck explained We dont care what the commodity is we just sell capacity Enrons approach differs significantly from others that have entered the trucking field as technologybased intermediaries NTE the former National Transportation Exchange puts buyers and sellers directly together while Logisticscom uses the contracting process to identify the most costeffective matches between shippers and carriers Unlike the online services Enron contracts directly with the party involved and does not wait for two to be matched up on its website Under Enrons ideal contract damages for nonperformance are spelled out explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers must be able to bank on the reliability of the contract For example suppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of per mile for a shipment of freight between Atlanta and Chicago If Enron does not provide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the carrier can find is cents per mile Enron pays the difference The same process would work in reverse If the carrier promised to provide a truck and didnt Enron would provide a replacement at a higher price and the trucker would have to make up the difference Reck said the standardized contract would not be dictated by Enron but would evolve through negotiations or public forums Efforts are under way to introduce the company to shippers carriers and other intermediaries Enron officials say theyve talked with to shippers since March One goal is to persuade an independent group such as a trucking association or committee of marketplace participants to sponsor a forum for negotiations which the company believes would add legitimacy In its first contract Enron is acting as a carrier since the shipper already was working with a thirdparty logistics provider Enron considers itself distinct from PLs It focuses on docktodock moves and leaves supplychain optimization to others Its aim is to allow parties to minimize risk for example by giving shippers the ability to hedge against the possibility of diesel passthrough fees Enron is an extensive user of the Internet however and last year launched EnronOnline for traders to trade natural gas oil electricity and various other commodities online No one expects Enrons new freight capacity product to capture immediate acceptance Even Enron acknowledges that acceptance will be slow Reck said it will take time to overcome cultural resistance to change in the freight industry and that Enron is prepared for that We have done that in every market we have gotten into Reck said What we find is the economic benefits of doing business this way overpowers resistance over time You have to show what the benefits are JOCO c Copyright The Journal of Commerce Inc All Rights Reserved Folder Name Rahil Jafry Relevance Score on Scale of To review or revise your folder visit or contact

Friday August PM To Subject Rahil Jafry POWER POINTS Skilling Moves On To Charities Family POWER POINTS Skilling Moves On To Charities Family By Mark Golden Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones Jeff Skilling will be spending the next few years working with charities in Houston and spending time with family the former chief executive of Enron Corp ENE said in an interview The yearold Skilling who resigned abruptly from Enron after the companys board meeting Aug repeatedly said he had left as stated for personal reasons Wall Street has been skeptical of the explanation and several analysts have said theyre waiting for the other shoe to drop The companys stock price fell in response to the announcement last week a loss of about billion in shareholder value and hasnt recovered this week But the former chief executive said the stock price will recover once investors see that his departure isnt a precursor to more bad news for the company Ive spent the last years working really hard said Skilling who requested the interview with Dow Jones Newswires There are a lot of things that I havent been doing personal interests spending time with family There are a number of charitable things that I havent spent the time on that I believe I should I dont mean fundraising but hands on getting out and doing things building houses helping individuals Skilling who has been involved with a multiple sclerosis charity for years said he plans to get involved in promoting the City of Houston Its massively underrated as a place to work and live he said Its a great city and I think I can do a lot to get that across Though insistent that there is nothing more to his departure than personal reasons Skilling said little to reveal why a talented executive would surrender the top spot of the countrys largest energy trading company just six months after taking the job Skilling had been Enrons No executive from until this year and hes generally credited with the success of Enrons wholesale trading operations which comprise about of the parents earnings He confirmed theres no crisis in his family and his health is fine Skilling who assumed the chief executive title on Feb also denied that he was suffering under the strain of the job Late last week Chairman Kenneth Lay and other Enron executives in New York told Wall Street analysts that Skilling had been going kind of nuts under the pressure of being chief executive one analyst said Its not true that I was cracking up he said Do I sound like someone who is cracking up The representation of me as thickskinned is a reasonable representation When asked if his departure could have been handled more smoothly so as not to alarm investors Skilling said that perhaps the mechanics could have been better but said that is hindsight We thought it through and thought we were going about it in the right way he said I dont know what we could have done differently It will turn out in retrospect fine as soon as people see that theres nothing else About One Weeks Notice The former chief executive totally disagreed with speculation in this column last week that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay who immediately resumed the role of chief executive may have wanted to regain daytoday control of the company and pushed Skilling out I think the world of Ken You cant find a bigger fan of his than me he said I was not forced out Personal and family reasons are of the story I guess its kind of mundane and Im sorry it doesnt have as much drama and suspense as a lot of people would like it to have but thats what the deal is Skilling said he spoke with Lay about wanting to do other things many times over the years The first serious discussion of his imminent departure came about a week before the announcement said Skilling whose recollection of his giving notice to Lay was somewhat cloudy The board knew what was going on and that was the point the Aug board meeting where the decisions were going to be made he said The decisions I guess to accept my resignation Skilling said Enron refused to release a copy of the minutes of the Aug board meeting which was regularly scheduled The company doesnt generally release boardmeeting minutes spokeswoman Karen Denne said The former chief executive continues to work as a paid adviser to Enron A clause in his contract prevents him from competing with the company through the end of and he has no plans to work outside the energy industry That might sound like a big comedown from running the countrys most aggressive energy company but Skilling said the move fits Some people say Well you were working and aspiring so long to become CEO of Enron Thats not true I was working to build a business and we did said Skilling who is credited with transforming the company into a trading powerhouse The company I built is doing great My life is moving on He also said the company will do fine without him Some analysts have expressed concern about Enrons ability to retain its top talent Skillings predecessor as Enrons No executive Richard Kinder for example left the company in after Lay announced that he

Magazines Cathie Black No on the list to publish O The Oprah Magazineby some measures the most successful magazine startup ever At No is Andrea Jung Chairman and CEO of Avon who has breathed life into ailing Avon Mirant CEO Marce Fullerthe only newcomer in the top fiveholds the No position Inside a stodgy utility Southern Fuller built a highgrowth trading and marketing unit which was spun off in April In these new more tempered times patience may be about to reap its reward In FORTUNEs annual survey of the Most Powerful Women in Business there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in Patient But Not Passive the story that accompanies the list By patience we mean staying with a company steadily building influence there and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge not promises and selfpromotion Fiorina who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNEs inaugural list in heads the biggest company billion in revenues last year run by a woman And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever Wall Street practically heckled her latest movea bold bet to buy Compaqbut Fiorina remains defiant In difficult times people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny she says As always the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time Last year power resided in the technology and Internet sectors but that influence was fleeting Gone from the list this year Deborah Hurricane Debby Hopkins who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May Ellen Hancock who failed at her startup Exodus and Morgan Stanleys Mary Meeker who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz But one Web warrior looks better than ever Meg Whitman No on the list She has never overpromised to investors instead she has diligently delivered abovetarget profits every single quarter Fourteen newcomers join the list this year Marce Fuller President CEO Mirant Louise Kitchen COO Enron Americas

Global Prescriptions Pharmacia Carole Black President and CEO Lifetime Television Networks Larree Renda EVP Retail Operations Safeway and Louise Francesconi VP and GM Missile Systems Raytheon While the economy and its points of power change the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same Says Sellers We consider the size and importance of a womans business in the global economy her clout inside her company and the arc of her careerwhere she has been and where she is likely to go When appropriate we also weigh the womans influence on mass culture and society That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No on this years list The shifts on our list this year are dramatic with newcomers But one trend is especially intriguing Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever A few years ago responsibility for a billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list No more This years FORTUNE includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of billion or more which is a first In a related story It Took a Lady To Save Avon Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung Chairman and CEO of Avon Says Brooker Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them And thats what has made her one of the most successful CEOsmale or femalein recent years Over the past months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business how it advertises manufactures packages and even sells its products and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady but by reviving her The result growth in revenues operating profits and operating margins In addition FORTUNE includes an international list of the powerful women in business The top ten featured in the magazine are Marjorie Scardino CEO Pearson Britain Anne Lauvergeon

our discretionJulie Ferrara will be responsible for publishing North American content and Im responsible for European content So if theres something on that everyones talking about Football then we could publish a news item if wed like As for the legal issue I spoke with Mark Taylor lawyer for Enron North America over a month ago and he correct me if Im wrong Mark seemed to differentiate between public domain content and proprietary content the difference between the two being whether or not you could possibly get the information from any other source I think sports scores is usually in the public domain category So lets keep up the good work and if you want to prepare a possible football related news item lets move towards publishing it always going through the normal channels of course

thoughts in detail to avoid confusion We should get together to discus s these thoughts if we all see some opportunities here Rahil ENWs Goals To leverage the brand value residing in EnronOnline to help brand and creat e value for Enrons other ecommerce initiatives DealBench ClickPaper CommodityLogic etc To find new ways to further develop and commercialize ENWs existing platforms ie use them to generate greater revenues andor enhance their intrinsic value in the market To strategically develop new businesses using Enron Net Works core skills This shouldwill lead to mediumlonger term revenues on a sustainable basis To generate shortmedium term revenues to meet targets and allow breathing room for longer term initiatives Landscape Few days ago I came across this blurb on one of the online news updates Upsidecom Meanwhile British Telecommunications BTY internal incubator Brights tar announced Wednesday an agreement to work with US based technology operati ng company incuVest a million holding company to create companies in th e communications field based on British Telecomms patents Thoughts BTs patents are probably mostly technological patents or process related patents No organization has the Bandwidth ie resources to commercialize this many patents by itself in a short period of time Doing it all themselves would mean having to work on commercializing these patents in a sequential manner which could take years Given the nature of these and all other patents timetomarket is critic al since disruptive technologies can render these assets valueless Even companies with adequate resources wont have all the skills required to develop new businesses since eplatforms require commercial technological legal regulatory and development approaches that span across various countries and industries Hence it would be in BTs best interests to try and Focus on commercializing only the select patents that they think may offer them most value and in which they have a truly developed skillbase Monetize the remaining patents by giving them away in exchange for equity or by selling them This will also help raise money to redeploy towards commercializing the higher value patents Pitch Enron Net Works would be the perfect partnersolution provider for BT and others to Evaluate the potential commercial value of BTs technological and process related patents so they can decide to whether incubate them internally or monetize them Auctionoff patents which BT considers to be less valuable via Deal Bench which has data rooms capabilities to showcase patent specific information as well as an ability to host several clients Commercialize patents with BT and or other people who participate in the auctions by providing a wellbranded business development infrastructure eg from the company that developed the worlds biggest ecommerce site i n record time Benefits to ENW Generate shortterm revenues from DealBenchs auctiondataroom platform while branding it in the longer run Gain access to ideas and partners with whom we can develop new opportunitie s Branch out into servicing other companies that hold proprietary information patents etc like Lucent Technologies Xerox and others Companies lik e this have been battered in the equity markets recently and would be open to ideas which helps them monetize some of their intellectual assets to appeas e the shareholders Have secondary benefits of knowing whats being developed in the markets b y plugging into a network of people and companies whove bought these patents and are commercializing them This may allow us to invest in new ventures that hold promise when the market outlook improves in the future Why Enron Net Works Our experience across industries and geography allows us to leverage our experiences to evaluate commercial opportunities Once the value has been identified we can use DealBench to monetize unwant ed assets in the broader market We have experience and the support infrastructure on which we can rely to minimize the development time legal tax regulatory technological and commercial support just like we did with EnronOnline Having industry and development experience has given us better skills to develop new opportunities compared to consultants and incubators who typically dont have these realworld business experiences Core skills include Evaluating technology and implementing it in the most scaleable manner Valuing the technology and opportunities from a financial standpoint Commercial and market based insights which are increasingly valuable in the eWorld where everything is getting commoditized due to decreasing interaction costs and increasing transparency ENW can quantify the value chain in these new industries Enrons overall ability to manage risks in an array of commodity markets Steps Forward dedicate some resources to Understand what it takes to do this and analyze whether we truly have the skills and resources to execute on this eg Is DealBench built for this Do we have the right skills etc We may also have to ally with some of the technologyspecific skills within EBS Identify the optimum number of new opportunities that can be valued auctioned andor developed by ENW This number may be only looking at opportunities at a time or auctioningoff no more than This is okay since we dont want to over extend ourselves since our credibility is at stake Identify toplevel contacts with each of these organizations BT and their partner incuVest Lucent Xerox etc whom we can sell on our idea Develop a contingency plan if the likes of BT Lucent and Xerox dont buy in due ENW not having done similar things before In this case we could mine the patent database to identify the owners and approach some of the smaller shops or other MomandPop owners to buy and develop these things This will allow us to develop an internal process and also develop a history If the patent holders have qualms about accidentally selling some patents with significant value like Xerox has done in the past we can structure creative contracts which allow them to share in the upside by retaining a certain percentage of the future earnings of the patent buyers somewhat li ke a portfolio of equity in startup companies Enron can even help provide liquidity for these portfolios in the future Let me know if you have any questionsideas Regards

Rules Legislation Aim to Clear Up Regulation of OvertheCounter ContractsUS Commodity Futures Trading CommissionBrief Article The Oil Daily ITEM Copyright Gale Group All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Energy Intelligence Group CFTC Rules Legislation Aim to Clear Up Regulation of OvertheCounter Contracts A long process designed to clarify rules for overthe counter OTC markets may be drawing to a close after the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC the main regulatory agency issued its final framework for a new regime The rules are designed to clear up the legal status of OTC products such as swaps while providing more flexible oversight of futures markets and promoting the establishment of independent clearinghouses Unveiled late last month the CFTC reforms are due to be published in the Federal Register next week and would take effect days later in midFebruary In the meantime a new president should take office Jan CFTC experts seem confident that the reforms will survive the changeover saying it is hard for an incoming administration to pull back final regulations There are also signs of progress on a parallel bill supporting the reforms the Commodity Futures Modernization Act This was passed by the House in late October but got bogged down in the Senate partly due to objections by Sen Phil Gramm RTexas who heads the Senate Banking Committee A compromise was hammered out early this week sources say and the law could still get through this year most likely as an attachment to an appropriations bill Legislation would give the CFTC measures a stronger legal footing but could require them to be tweaked into line The CFTC reforms respond to the explosion of both derivatives markets and electronic trading from equities to natural gas Currently electronic exchanges targeting derivatives markets such as the Big Oilbacked IntercontinentalExchange operate in a regulatory gray area The new reforms define futures exchanges more flexibly replacing a onesizefitsall approach with core principles and establishing three tiers of regulation The top tier of recognized futures exchanges RFEs matches the current futures markets such as Nymex and is the most tightly regulated The second rank of derivatives transaction facilities DTFs comprises institutions requiring looser regulation if for example participation is restricted to big companies The third tier of exempt multilateral transaction execution facilities Exempt MTEFs escapes most regulation In parallel the CFTC has clarified an old ruling removing swaps from regulation the socalled Part exemption This ends previous restrictions so that OTC products traded between two parties can now be fungible standardized and cleared This is part of a drive to turn derivatives into legally recognized products making it hard for one side to renege on an unfavorable contract Finally the CFTC has moved to encourage the establishment of independent clearinghouses by separating the rules for exchange and clearing functions Two startups EnergyClear and NexClear have already declared their intention to offer such services starting with US gas and power Amid concerns about price manipulation the energy industry has been treated as a special case throughout the new framework and does not qualify for the leastregulated Exempt MTEF category of exchange The CFTC reforms also remain fuzzy in certain areas In particular the new Part exemption for derivatives covers bilateral transactions with multilateral activity still in something of a gray area Basically an exchange handling multilateral trades of energy derivatives can apply to the CFTC for official status as a commercial DTF if it thinks this will bring credibility and legal standing However a derivatives exchange that does not register with the CFTC will not be pursued The new framework offers legal certainty for those who want recognition it is not ruling on the status of those who dont one expert said In practice outfits such as EnronOnline the web system for direct transactions with Enron are in the clear as bilateral platforms dealing in contracts outside CFTC jurisdiction Intercontinental as a multilateral exchange dealing in standardized swaps could probably remain unregulated but could also register as a DTF to clarify its status Nymex in its current form would be an RFE because it entertains noninstitutional traders But the exchange could apply for its planned electronic arm enymex or its traditional floor to become a DTF by limiting activity to institutional users David Pike Manimoli

Rules Legislation Aim to Clear Up Regulation of OvertheCounter ContractsUS Commodity Futures Trading CommissionBrief Article The Oil Daily ITEM Copyright Gale Group All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Energy Intelligence Group CFTC Rules Legislation Aim to Clear Up Regulation of OvertheCounter Contracts A long process designed to clarify rules for overthe counter OTC markets may be drawing to a close after the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC the main regulatory agency issued its final framework for a new regime The rules are designed to clear up the legal status of OTC products such as swaps while providing more flexible oversight of futures markets and promoting the establishment of independent clearinghouses Unveiled late last month the CFTC reforms are due to be published in the Federal Register next week and would take effect days later in midFebruary In the meantime a new president should take office Jan CFTC experts seem confident that the reforms will survive the changeover saying it is hard for an incoming administration to pull back final regulations There are also signs of progress on a parallel bill supporting the reforms the Commodity Futures Modernization Act This was passed by the House in late October but got bogged down in the Senate partly due to objections by Sen Phil Gramm RTexas who heads the Senate Banking Committee A compromise was hammered out early this week sources say and the law could still get through this year most likely as an attachment to an appropriations bill Legislation would give the CFTC measures a stronger legal footing but could require them to be tweaked into line The CFTC reforms respond to the explosion of both derivatives markets and electronic trading from equities to natural gas Currently electronic exchanges targeting derivatives markets such as the Big Oilbacked IntercontinentalExchange operate in a regulatory gray area The new reforms define futures exchanges more flexibly replacing a onesizefitsall approach with core principles and establishing three tiers of regulation The top tier of recognized futures exchanges RFEs matches the current futures markets such as Nymex and is the most tightly regulated The second rank of derivatives transaction facilities DTFs comprises institutions requiring looser regulation if for example participation is restricted to big companies The third tier of exempt multilateral transaction execution facilities Exempt MTEFs escapes most regulation In parallel the CFTC has clarified an old ruling removing swaps from regulation the socalled Part exemption This ends previous restrictions so that OTC products traded between two parties can now be fungible standardized and cleared This is part of a drive to turn derivatives into legally recognized products making it hard for one side to renege on an unfavorable contract Finally the CFTC has moved to encourage the establishment of independent clearinghouses by separating the rules for exchange and clearing functions Two startups EnergyClear and NexClear have already declared their intention to offer such services starting with US gas and power Amid concerns about price manipulation the energy industry has been treated as a special case throughout the new framework and does not qualify for the leastregulated Exempt MTEF category of exchange The CFTC reforms also remain fuzzy in certain areas In particular the new Part exemption for derivatives covers bilateral transactions with multilateral activity still in something of a gray area Basically an exchange handling multilateral trades of energy derivatives can apply to the CFTC for official status as a commercial DTF if it thinks this will bring credibility and legal standing However a derivatives exchange that does not register with the CFTC will not be pursued The new framework offers legal certainty for those who want recognition it is not ruling on the status of those who dont one expert said In practice outfits such as EnronOnline the web system for direct transactions with Enron are in the clear as bilateral platforms dealing in contracts outside CFTC jurisdiction Intercontinental as a multilateral exchange dealing in standardized swaps could probably remain unregulated but could also register as a DTF to clarify its status Nymex in its current form would be an RFE because it entertains noninstitutional traders But the exchange could apply for its planned electronic arm enymex or its traditional floor to become a DTF by limiting activity to institutional users David Pike Manimoli

<30048221.1075860259221.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,rahil.jafry@enron.com,2000-12-22 08:06:00,Potential commercial opportunities for ENWfor my Jerry McGuiretype long winded Memo but I wanted articula te my thoughts in detail to avoid confusion We should get together to discus s these thoughts if we all see some opportunities here Rahil ENWs Goals To leverage the brand value residing in EnronOnline to help brand and creat e value for Enrons other ecommerce initiatives DealBench ClickPaper CommodityLogic etc To find new ways to further develop and commercialize ENWs existing platforms ie use them to generate greater revenues andor enhance their intrinsic value in the market To strategically develop new businesses using Enron Net Works core skills This shouldwill lead to mediumlonger term revenues on a sustainable basis To generate shortmedium term revenues to meet targets and allow breathing room for longer term initiatives Landscape Few days ago I came across this blurb on one of the online news updates Upsidecom Meanwhile British Telecommunications BTY internal incubator Brights tar announced Wednesday an agreement to work with US based technology operati ng company incuVest a million holding company to create companies in th e communications field based on British Telecomms patents Thoughts BTs patents are probably mostly technological patents or process related patents No organization has the Bandwidth ie resources to commercialize this many patents by itself in a short period of time Doing it all themselves would mean having to work on commercializing these patents in a sequential manner which could take years Given the nature of these and all other patents timetomarket is critic al since disruptive technologies can render these assets valueless Even companies with adequate resources wont have all the skills required to develop new businesses since eplatforms require commercial technological legal regulatory and development approaches that span across various countries and industries Hence it would be in BTs best interests to try and Focus on commercializing only the select patents that they think may offer them most value and in which they have a truly developed skillbase Monetize the remaining patents by giving them away in exchange for equity or by selling them This will also help raise money to redeploy towards commercializing the higher value patents Pitch Enron Net Works would be the perfect partnersolution provider for BT and others to Evaluate the potential commercial value of BTs technological and process related patents so they can decide to whether incubate them internally or monetize them Auctionoff patents which BT considers to be less valuable via Deal Bench which has data rooms capabilities to showcase patent specific information as well as an ability to host several clients Commercialize patents with BT and or other people who participate in the auctions by providing a wellbranded business development infrastructure eg from the company that developed the worlds biggest ecommerce site i n record time Benefits to ENW Generate shortterm revenues from DealBenchs auctiondataroom platform while branding it in the longer run Gain access to ideas and partners with whom we can develop new opportunitie s Branch out into servicing other companies that hold proprietary information patents etc like Lucent Technologies Xerox and others Companies lik e this have been battered in the equity markets recently and would be open to ideas which helps them monetize some of their intellectual assets to appeas e the shareholders Have secondary benefits of knowing whats being developed in the markets b y plugging into a network of people and companies whove bought these patents and are commercializing them This may allow us to invest in new ventures that hold promise when the market outlook improves in the future Why Enron Net Works Our experience across industries and geography allows us to leverage our experiences to evaluate commercial opportunities Once the value has been identified we can use DealBench to monetize unwant ed assets in the broader market We have experience and the support infrastructure on which we can rely to minimize the development time legal tax regulatory technological and commercial support just like we did with EnronOnline Having industry and development experience has given us better skills to develop new opportunities compared to consultants and incubators who typically dont have these realworld business experiences Core skills include Evaluating technology and implementing it in the most scaleable manner Valuing the technology and opportunities from a financial standpoint Commercial and market based insights which are increasingly valuable in the eWorld where everything is getting commoditized due to decreasing interaction costs and increasing transparency ENW can quantify the value chain in these new industries Enrons overall ability to manage risks in an array of commodity markets Steps Forward dedicate some resources to Understand what it takes to do this and analyze whether we truly have the skills and resources to execute on this eg Is DealBench built for this Do we have the right skills etc We may also have to ally with some of the technologyspecific skills within EBS Identify the optimum number of new opportunities that can be valued auctioned andor developed by ENW This number may be only looking at opportunities at a time or auctioningoff no more than This is okay since we dont want to over extend ourselves since our credibility is at stake Identify toplevel contacts with each of these organizations BT and their partner incuVest Lucent Xerox etc whom we can sell on our idea Develop a contingency plan if the likes of BT Lucent and Xerox dont buy in due ENW not having done similar things before In this case we could mine the patent database to identify the owners and approach some of the smaller shops or other MomandPop owners to buy and develop these things This will allow us to develop an internal process and also develop a history If the patent holders have qualms about accidentally selling some patents with significant value like Xerox has done in the past we can structure creative contracts which allow them to share in the upside by retaining a certain percentage of the future earnings of the patent buyers somewhat li ke a portfolio of equity in startup companies Enron can even help provide liquidity for these portfolios in the future Let me know if you have any questionsideas Regards

launch this second phase of EnronOnline well have to rely on other third party content for general news items as in Europe As best I understand it this occasional news will be placed on the site at our discretionJulie Ferrara will be responsible for publishing North American content and Im responsible for European content So if theres something on that everyones talking about Football then we could publish a news item if wed like As for the legal issue I spoke with Mark Taylor lawyer for Enron North America over a month ago and he correct me if Im wrong Mark seemed to differentiate between public domain content and proprietary content the difference between the two being whether or not you could possibly get the information from any other source I think sports scores is usually in the public domain category So lets keep up the good work and if you want to prepare a possible football related news item lets move towards publishing it always going through the normal channels of course
