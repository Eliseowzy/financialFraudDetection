<14108065.1075862398707.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,l..schrab@enron.com,2001-10-19 10:03:28,FW Read this Thought you would find this of interest Im a Bad American Date Fri Jun Written by Ted Nugent the rock singer and hunternaturalists upon hearing that California Senators B Boxer and D Feinstein denounced him for being a gun owner and a Rock Star This was his response after telling the senators about his past contributions to childrens charities and scholarship foundations which have totaled more than million in the last years Im a Bad Americanthis pretty much sums it up for me I like big trucks big boats big houses and naturally pretty women I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family not some midlevel governmental functionary with a bad combover who wants to give it away to crack addicts squirting out babies I dont care about appearing compassionate I think playing with toy guns doesnt make you a killer I believe ignoring your kids and giving them Prozac might I think Im doing better than the homeless I dont think being a minority makes you noble or victimized I have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are different weird or make me mad This is my life to live and not necessarily up to others expectations I know what SEX is and there are not varying degrees of it I dont celebrate Kwanzaa But if you want to thats fine I just dont feel like everyone else should have to I believe that if you are selling me a Dairy Queen shake a pack of cigarettes or hotel room you do it in English As of matter of fact if you are an American citizen you should speak English My uncles and forefathers shouldnt have had to die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born in to come disrespect ours and make us bend to your will Get over it I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry butt if youre running from them after they tell you to stop If you cant understand the word freeze or stop in English see the previous line I dont use the excuse its for the children as a shield for unpopular opinions or actions I know how to count votes and I feel much safer letting a machine with no political affiliation do a recount when needed I know what the definition of lying is and it isnt based on the word isever I dont think just because you were not born in this country you qualify for any special loan programs govt sponsored bank loans etc so you can open a hotel Eleven trinket shop or any thing else while the indigenous peoples cant get past a high school education because they cant afford it I didnt take the initiative in inventing the Internet I thought the Taco Bell dog was funny I want them to bring back safe and sane fireworks I believe no one ever died because of something Ozzy Osbourne IceT or Marilyn Manson sang but that doesnt mean I want to listen to that junk from someone elses car when Im stopped at a red light But I respect your right to I think that being a student doesnt give you any more enlightenment than working at Blockbuster or Jack In The Box I dont want to eat or drink anything with the words light lite or fatfree on the package Our soldiers did not go to some foreign country and risk their lives in vain and defend our Constitution so that decades later you can tell me its a living document ever changing and is open to interpretation The guys who wrote it were light years ahead of anyone today and they meant what they said now leave the document alone or theres going to be trouble I dont hate the rich I help the poor I know wrestling is fake Ive never owned or was a slave and a large percentage of our forefathers werent wealthy enough to own one either Please stop blaming me because some prior white people were idiots and remember tons of white Indian Chinese and other races have been enslaved too it was wrong for every one of them I believe a selfrighteous liberal with a cause is more dangerous than a Hells Angel with an attitude I want to know exactly which church is it where the Reverend Jessie Jackson preaches and what exactly is his job function I own a gun you can own a gun and any red blooded American should be allowed to own a gun but if you use it in a crime then you will serve the time I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made and continue to make more If it makes you mad then invent the next operating system thats better and put your name on the building Ask your buddy that invented the Internet to help you I dont believe in hate crime legislation Even suggesting it makes me mad Youre telling me that someone who is a minority gay disabled another nationality or otherwise different from the mainstream of this country has more value as a human being that I do as a white male If someone kills anyone Id say that its a hate crime We dont need more laws Lets enforce the ones we already have I think turkey bacon turkey beef turkey fake anything sucks I believe that it doesnt take a village to raise a childit takes a parent with the guts to stand up to the kid and spank his butt and say NO whenits necessary to do so Ill admit that the only movie that ever made me cry was Ole Yeller I didnt realize Dr Seuss was a genius until I had a kid I will not be frowned upon or be looked down upon or be made to keep silent because I have these beliefs and opinions I thought this country allowed me that right I will not conform or compromise just to keep from hurting somebodys feelings Im neither angry nor disenfranchised no matter how desperately the mainstream media would like the world to believe otherwise Yes I guess by some peoples definition I may be a bad American But thats tough Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at intlasp
