Leadership to support a significant initiative for Enron The recipients of this Email are the HR practitioners and Legal advisers being asked to revise the form and scope of the Companys Human Resource Policies Project NForm is being formally launched after completing detailed consultations with each Vice President of Human Resources HR Leadership selected you to represent the practical aspects and needs of the business units and to lend your talents and professional acumen to the projects deliverable HR Leadership has provided specific recommendations for guiding the process of review and revision Mindful of these mandates this effort will significantly modify the form content and presentation of HR policy information to our employees The Concept The current HR policy document is being revised to a narrative format The purpose scope and responsibilities typical of the current policy format will be converted into a conversational dialogue carefully structured to convey the information employees need to know about the rules and control that Enron chooses to adopt Roles and accountabilities As a critical participant you will review each narrative provide dialogue and context to its related issues and assist the group in applying the defined criteria A formal process will be necessary You will be asked to help develop the guidelines HR Leadership will require periodic updates and fundamental evaluations to reach a consensus on each policy recommendations You will be a vital participant in meeting that need Format There are a variety of elements to consider within this opportunity Each Policy Narrative will ultimately be supported by legal and technical determinations Access to that foundation information will be a part of the new format The desire for Business Unit distinctions has been considered and the new policy format will accommodate that desire Equally important the narrative format will allow documentation of the geographic and regulatory circumstances that differ from US domestic policy The revised format will provide for georegulatory distinctions specific to the employment issues not dependent on US regulatorycompliance The objective is to establish HR Policy Narratives that will be responsive to information needs of employees as well as business units with global reach Policy determinations Our team will be known as the NForm Group To the greatest extent possible the associated reviews dialogue and edit tasks will be online work Fully aware that each of the NForm Group has a complete portfolio of accountabilities to address Project NForm will avoid scheduled meetings and marginal agendas Significant efforts at groupthink will be necessary however the vast amount of work progress will occur via email and comment tracing Please review the attached tactical action plan This plan is a preliminary effort to isolate deliverables and mileposts In addition it will scope some of the issues and perspectives offered by HR Leadership and legal Counsel The Office of Labor Employment Relations OLER will initiate each Policy Narrative You will periodically receive a NForm Policy document as well as current or related policies for reference There will be three distinct tiers to each Policy Narrative Narrative based upon US Domestic law regulations etc Business Unit Distinctions Georegulatory Distinctions To accomplish this formidable task each policy will need your prompt attention Your suggestions perspectives and related citations need to be returned by Email reply within days of receiving each draft Comments will be consolidated and included as part of the subsequent revision drafts In each case the turn around must be prompt Legal and practical considerations will be consolidated for the opportunity to finetune each narrative In the absence of a response the NForm Group will assume that your business unit and practical consideration have been satisfied Once a final draft has been developed communication specialists will review the message to be certain that clear and positive information is being conveyed HR Leadership has provided specific guidance and specific license simultaneously Please consider the following concepts as guideposts in the task ahead User friendly and up to date HR Policies that are appropriate for the risks we manage HR Policy should be supported by a regulatory or statutory mandate Some Organizational principles exist as Policy to ensure the desired conduct prevails Evaluate every HR Policy and remove the clearly procedural aspects Fewer Policies are necessary when supported by appropriate procedures and guidelines HR Policy information should link to definitions clarifications legal basis procedures and HR guidelines based upon need to access A clear mandates exists Policy revision is needed wanted and must be done right The Policy initiative is a clear way to reinforce our vision and values and the culture at Enron HR Policy procedure and guidelines should be just a click away Policies as the top layer details belong is subsequent layers Policies should be the guide rails what we define as must do use procedure to define the instructions directions and references Please take a few moments to contemplate this opportunity If you are not willing to assume this role please let me know I will be asking you to participate in an introductory and strategy meeting the week of June Th in Houston For the interim we will begin circulating the first of many narrative drafts for your input I look forward to your support insights and active participation on Project NForm Please call if you have any questions or concerns Regards Rick Johnson Houston Portland Distribution Gary Buck Sharon Butcher Jim Carlson
