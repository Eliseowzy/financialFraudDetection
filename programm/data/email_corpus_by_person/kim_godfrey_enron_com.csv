communication In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement I would like to fill yourself David and Bob in on some history During the meetings in August EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and identified sections to be clarified amended There was a group of at least Compaq attendees Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq Both EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services Spreadsheets were exchanged between both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon A significant amount of time was spent in this process between August through October EBS and Compaq Derrick Deakins developed contract language to clarify the outstanding sections This contract amendment was sent to Compaq Rob and Derrick for comments in November EBS has not heard anything regarding the language During the course of these discussions EBS agreed to concede on certain points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in The EBS concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services This was reason for the development of the EBS Consulting Payment EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with our relationship Kim Godfrey Director Enterprise Services

GodfreyEnron nron Communications Anthony GilmoreEnron nron Communications cc Subject Computer Associates Meeting Notes Stephen Down and I met with Computer Associates in Toronto yesterday Here are some of my thoughts on how it went We met with Julia in the morning went to CAs Toronto office where we made presentation on EBS Later Julia made a presentation on Computer Associates their Sales manager talked about their security suit of products we were given a demonstration of their UniCenter TNG software and then taken to lunch At lunch we were joined by the President of Worldwide Online Corporation a Canadian startup About Computer Associates Computer Associates is a highly centralized organization run by its founders The company is the third largest independent software manufacturing business in the world It offers more then software products Like other companies in their space their stock has taken a beating this year losing more then half its value Jan now Julia Ruslys is part of their Strategic Alliances team their mandate is to manage Strategic Business Alliances Development Partner Program eForce technology unit Analyst relations CAs APPROACH Computer Associates sees EBS as a potential development partner Their interest seems to be in a longterm alliance with EBS where they can package their software with a bundled network offering from EBS for their clients They claim that their main product UniCenter TNG has a market share of IT infrastructure management market It is a cutting software package that can manage all LANs or remote networks for an Enterprise With a stunning graphic interface the software can be configured to manage All networks within an Enterprise Each computer connected to a node within the enterprise can be monitored and managed remotely software installation etc Their is a plethora of addons to the basic UniCenter package including some advanced Asset Management tools that can predict future utilization through a neural network architecture She commented that with UniCenter TNG our clients have full control and flexibility over their whole network EXCEPT THEIR BANDWIDTH NEEDS EBSs flexible and intelligent BOS if integrated with UniCenter TNG can provide an enterprise complete control over their IT infrastructure with exceptional flexibility Similarly they have a keen interesting in developing and expanding their storage solutions They seem to be interested in expanding their market opportunity and increasing revenues through increasing the number of CA certifications and joint selling initiatives In other words they would like EBSs network to be CAcertified by developing compatibility between UniCenter TNG and IPNet Connect They currently have partners including almost all top names in IT infrastructure space EBS APPROACH CONVEYED Although I think we have conveyed EBSs approach of looking at specific quick and clear opportunities CA does not seem like a leanmean organization Furthermore the people that we met with did not seem to have an appreciation of the financial structuring and risk management capabilities instead seemed to be disconnected with the corporate financial goals of their organization For example when Steve Dowd talked about financial risk management tools their sales manager started talking about how they help enterprises manage risk through their security software packages WORLDWIDE ONLINE CORP Worldwide Online Corp is a startup with less then M revenues that claims to have good connections with CBC Canadian Broadcasting Corp They were in contact with Brad Sims group out of Portland That group at some point lost interest in Worldwide because Worldwide are looking for video streaming services Being a startup with no credit it is understandable why they were abandoned by us Steve made it clear that he knows nothing about the deal and he may give Brad a call I personally do not see anything for us in the next two quarters or so even though the company has been promised many sports broadcast opportunities by CBC It is interesting that Worldwide Online is a small client of CA Julia went out of her way to convince us to meet with Worldwide Online At one point I almost thought as if her main goal was to promote a dialogue between EBS and Worldwide online NEXT STEPS Steve and I made it clear that it will be important for us to look at some specific short to mediumterm opportunity with CA Julia is going to identify the people in her organization whom we can have constructive dialogue with regards to IP connectivity needs of CA their network infrastructure procurement team At the same time we had to show an interest in bringing her team together with our product development people to see if any integration opportunities exist between UniCenter TNG and IPNet Connect BOSStorage etc Ali

Furthermore the people that we met with did not seem to have an appreciation of the financial structuring and risk management capabilities instead seemed to be disconnected with the corporate financial goals of their organization For example when Steve Dowd talked about financial risk management tools their sales manager started talking about how they help enterprises manage risk through their security software packages WORLDWIDE ONLINE CORP Worldwide Online Corp is a startup with less then M revenues that claims to have good connections with CBC Canadian Broadcasting Corp They were in contact with Brad Sims group out of Portland That group at some point lost interest in Worldwide because Worldwide are looking for video streaming services Being a startup with no credit it is understandable why they were abandoned by us Steve made it clear that he knows nothing about the deal and he may give Brad a call I personally do not see anything for us in the next two quarters or so even though the company has been promised many sports broadcast opportunities by CBC It is interesting that Worldwide Online is a small client of CA Julia went out of her way to convince us to meet with Worldwide Online At one point I almost thought as if her main goal was to promote a dialogue between EBS and Worldwide online NEXT STEPS Steve and I made it clear that it will be important for us to look at some specific short to mediumterm opportunity with CA Julia is going to identify the people in her organization whom we can have constructive dialogue with regards to IP connectivity needs of CA their network infrastructure procurement team At the same time we had to show an interest in bringing her team together with our product development people to see if any integration opportunities exist between UniCenter TNG and IPNet Connect BOSStorage etc Ali
