expressed to him our desire to discuss acquisition of the plants and that we are prepared to move quickly He indicated that they are going to take the next couple of weeks to assess how best to remarket these facilities and that they were leaning towards an open RFP type process perhaps with the help of an ibank advisor My objective is to steer them away from this path and in that regard I gave him a rundown of a number of reasons why they would do well to enter discussions with us ASAP eg unique situation in that we serve load in UIs area good relationship with the CT regulators no market power concerns that killed the NRG deal ability to affect improvementscleanup at the sites etc He asked me to send him a letter outlining these qualifiers and was recptive to a meeting in the near future I am going to try and hook up with him in CT as he is on business there this week As for location these plants definitely are in a good spot given that southern CT is quite constrained However the really binding constraint is in the NorwalkStamford area these plants are located outside of this area I am trying to get some more granular information on the locationsseverity of constraints in southern CT to help assess constraints in the BridgeportNew Haven area where the plants are One other point is that the one of the units at the Bridgeport station is in deactived reserve an MW oil plant so there may be some relatively cheap expansionrepowering plays I did learn that they have an asset management deal with a rdparty through mid next year unless they sell off the plants before then I will update with status as we move along John Original Message From Kitchen Louise Sent Wed PM To Presto Kevin M Miller Don Asset Mktg Robinson Mitch Davis Mark Dana Llodra John Broderick Paul J Cc Lavorato John Duran W David Subject RE Conn Coal Plants Both John Llodra and Don Miller have had discussions with regard to pursuing these assets over the last week Essentially these plants may be the first distress sales we see in the market place JohnDon can you let everyone know how you plan to move forward Original Message From Presto Kevin M Sent Wednesday September PM To Miller Don Asset Mktg Robinson Mitch Davis Mark Dana Llodra John Broderick Paul J Cc Lavorato John Kitchen Louise Duran W David Subject Conn Coal Plants As most of you know NRGs proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut UIs territory was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago The proposed purchase price of million for MW of coal was a bargain price at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT Over the past years the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they puked the plants to NRG for kW in early At a minimum it is expected that kW of SCR andor scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies My strong view is that as a practical matter the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area In a true locational marginal price environment the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York Currently pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads regardless of who causes the congestion In the recently proposed single NE RTO model it is about certain that the PJM locational marginal price market model will be implemented sometime between mid and mid At that point in time consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL incity Boston and CT will be exposed to higher energy prices while consumers in Maine New Hampshire and Rhode Island should see lower prices Given the facts above coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset node If we could buy these plants for approx kW with kW of environmental upgrades the resulting allin depr fixed variable OM fuel costs NOx SO capital reserve interest x plant cost would be approx Mwh This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve Additional upside is derived from positive basis ICAP ancillary services emissions allowances and long term requirements sales to LSEs Lavo and Louise This could be the Alberta PPA for Lots of hair but lots of upside Any thoughts
