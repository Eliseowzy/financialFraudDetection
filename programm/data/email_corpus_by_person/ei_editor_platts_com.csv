valued at over billion had been in trouble for months and each side sued the other in state court in New York PNM said the merger could be terminated after Dec under the terms of the deal if there had not been satisfactory progress made towards completing the transaction But Western has disputed that PNM had grounds to back out of the deal PNM sued Western in October seeking to get out of the deal alleging breach of contract in part because of adverse rulings from the Kansas Corporation Commission KCC on rates and a Western restructuring plan considered vital to the transaction Western fired back with its own lawsuit a month later seeking at least million in damages against PNM for alleged extortion breach of contract sabotage and improper interference in the KCC proceedings Neither case has been decided although PNM has asked the court to either dismiss Westerns case or delay action on it until after it has decided PNMs initial suit Western also has appealed the KCC order blocking a

Nine states will sue if pollution controls are weakened The attorneys general of nine northeastern US states said Tuesday they would sue to block new federal regulations should they weaken pollution controls at power plants The Bush administration is considering changes to socalled new source review regulations that verge on the wholesale weakening of the Clean Air Act NY Attorney General Eliot Spitzer told a press briefing Although the attorneys general focused on the adverse impact on air quality caused by emissions from coalburning power plants in the Midwest changes in the NSR program would also affect oil refineries The attorneys general said they would consider challenging the administrative process that led to the new regulations which provided industry unfettered access Spitzer said but denied access to the states The Bush administration would also be violating federal statutes by changing the rules in the middle of the game Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said The new source review program requires industrial facilities to install new pollution control equipment when they upgrade their operations The Environmental Protection Agency under the Clinton administration filed suit that was joined by several states alleging that a number of utilities upgraded their plants under the guise of doing routine maintenance to avoid the NSR requirements The EPA also initiated vigorous enforcement of the NSR program against refiners which led to a number of multimillion dollar settlements of NSR violations The refinery and utility industry are lobbying for

separate oceanwave power initiatives on the western North American coastline suggest this novel technology may be poised to make inroads into previously skeptical markets In the US plans are underway to build a MW offshore demonstration project near Neah Bay in Washington State The project developer is startup company AquaEnergy Group Ltd The local Clallam public utility district has committed to purchasing the power from the Makah Nation a North American Indian tribe which will own and operate the development when completed Once this permitting and development precedent has been set we believe offshore wave power has the potential to satisfy to of total US power demand within years said Alla Weinstein CEO of AquaEnergy Farther north BC Hydro intends to develop up to MW of ocean wave power as part of a broader plan to install MW of renewable energy generation on Vancouver Island British Columbia This is not an RD exercise for us said Brenda Goehring spokesperson for BC Hydro If this turns out to be a viable resource the potential is huge for North America Supporting this potential according to wave power proponents is that this novel renewable offers some advantages over other green power sources For example relative to other intermittent renewables the energy in waves is somewhat predictable Historical seasonal data on wave and tidal movements are available and waves travel long distances making it possible to calculate their arrival time Plus if there is excess energy the devices can be used for other purposes such as water desalinization added Weinstein In some areas a new supply of fresh water would be a valuable ancillary benefit of power generation Wave projects also offer the potential to support local economies This is not like wind power where you have to buy a large turbine from Denmark for example said Goehring These are smallscale devices that can be manufactured and managed locally Its a new opportunity for regional industry The proposed projects should help to define the permitting requirements and perfect the technology thereby paving the way for commercial applicability if they prove to be costcompetitive Equally important these

policy importance Even with a highpowered electron microscope it is hard to see any silver lining in the clouds surrounding the events of Sept The attacks on the US did however spotlight the countrys need for more domestic oil and gas reserves and a uniform national energy policy Initially the BushCheney energy plan was bumped down on the White House and Capitol Hills list of legislative priorities But that plan in different formulations has begun to resurface propelled by a new sense of urgency that could turn into a crisis if retaliatory American military action destabilizes an already unstable Middle East bringing about another oil shock The war against terrorism could still push energy off the political agenda because lawmakers have no time to focus on it But commodity indices could end up benefiting should policy makers decide to pursue US energy independence even though it remains unclear as yet how that might ultimately play out American independents have always had an ambiguous attitude toward the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC For decades the cartel has kept global oil prices for the most part high which obviously has helped US producers

pretty well for us as well because its a price that keeps oil in the something range said Lee Fuller vice president of government relations for the Independent Petroleum Association of America IPAA

price of barrel for OPECs crude basket midrange of a price band is too high given the state of the world economy Kuwaiti oil minister Adel alSubih said Thursday We as Kuwaitwould be satisfied with the lower half of the band Subih said adding that Kuwait had proposed lowering the band to barrel I think OPEC will reconsider the price band at a later stage Subih said Kuwait had also suggested that the price band mechanism become a target rather than a mechanism Under the mechanism OPEC could cut or increase production by barrels per day if prices strayed from the band for a determined period of time but this has been allowed to lapse since the recent slide in prices and the economic uncertainty following the Sept attacks in the US Subih said Kuwait had based next years budget on a price of barrel for Kuwaiti crude I see there will be very hard times to come in the form of very low prices and then things will square out Subih said when asked how long it would be before nonOPEC agreed to cooperate But he stressed OPECs move did not constitute a price war We are not talking about a price war That would mean dumping oil We have huge excess capacity and that we do not intend to do Subih said He added OPEC was making an offer that is hard to refuse in offering to cut barrels in return for one from nonOPEC producers There is no time frame but I would say before January we will have something developing Already there are positive signals from nonOPEC producers Subih said OPEC had been forced to act because independent producers had failed to respond to calls for voluntarily output cuts on three occasions this year when OPEC had slashed output by million barrels per day Caterpillar and FuelCell Energy agree to jointly distribute fuel cell technology Caterpillar Inc and

a joint partner in Foothills with Vancouverbased Westcoast Energy which is in the process of being taken over by Duke Energy Foothills has US and Canadian regulatory permits dating from to build the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System which would run through Alaska along the highway into western Canada and ultimately into the lower states The new proposal is to build a or inchdiameter

have said the existing proposala mile pipeline with capacity for billion cubic feetdaywould cost billion The three North Slope producersExxonMobil BP and Phillips Petroleumtestified at a Senate hearing this fall that the economics of any Alaskatolower pipeline were questionable Kvisle said he hopes a smaller project will persuade the producers to give early backing to the engineering phase and in the process see how gas supply and demand unfolds The dramatic drop in wellhead gas prices this year has fueled concerns that a pipeline from Alaska is no longer economical Kvisle noted Still

output of Priest Rapids Hydroelectric Project and withdrawn its participation in a competitive license application for the project PacifiCorp agreed to a contract with Grant Public Utility District No the current owner and operator of the project for purchase of a share of the project output when current contracts expire in and Grant County Public Utility District said that that it has received power sales contract commitments from all of its current utility power customers as well as additional purchasers in Idaho added as a result of a recent FERC administrative proceeding The PUD had placed an endofyear deadline on contract terms PacifiCorp and the Yakama Indian Nation had announced in August that they were forming a partnership to challenge the PUD for the license However in signing the new contract this week PacifiCorp agreed that it will support Grant PUDs relicensing effort effectively ending its participation in any challenge PacifiCorp says that the contract the company has just concluded is more favorable than that previously offered by the PUD If so this suggests that the competitive license move may have been a strategy to improved power purchase contract terms The Yakama Nation has said that it will move forward with the competitive license application despite PacifiCorps decision to pull out of the partnership Hence the PUDs license for the Priest
