Kathleen Sullivan Lora Thome Jennifer Tiberi Fino Twiggs Thane Van Biert Teun Walton Steve Warner Geriann Watanabe Mika W ood Doug Yeung Charles Yoho Lisa SubjectGovernment Affairs Organization Announcement With the announcement of Enrons acquisition by Dynegy behind us and with the initial severance process completed it seemed an appropriate time to e ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future Before I turn to the organizational changes I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance youll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart Leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegeI am thankful for every day that I have had that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re sponsibility This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat ed group of professionals and support staff and who to a person are also very decent and good people To say goodbye to some of our colleagues is not easy I want to on behalf of all of us thank them for their hard wor k their integrity their decency and the good times and laughter that we shared I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done As to the organizational structure it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines particularly within the US has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times The nee d to rationalize the organizational structure in order to consolidate all US energy functions is a strong need from my perspective As a result Jim Steffes will lead the US Energy group along with Sue Nord who will j ointly report to Jim and myself Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h elp Jim shoulder a significant burden Also reporting to Jim will be a lea dership group for US Energy that will be as follows Wholesale Electrici ty will be led by Christi Nicolay Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will be led by Harry Kingerski Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner La st but not least Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara who will continue to focus o n California energy issues will report to Jim Sue Mara will also be part of the Wholesale electricity team Steve Montovano who will continue to report to me will lead a commercial development effort along with Dan Allegretti With the elimination of the regional groups I also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our politicalleg islative needs across the US Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w ill address that need and that will focus on state political support Paul will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev elopment efforts across the US Much of the rest of the group remains the same Linda Robertson will conti nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel who reports to Linda taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC Amr Ibrahi m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function Maggy Huson will take over su pport of the nonenergy business units which are as follows Global Market s Industrial Markets Networks and Broadband Rob Hemstock will continue to lead the support of Enron Canada Paul Dawson who heads up government affairs for Europe Sergio Assad who heads up government affairs for Sout h America and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther who head up our Asian efforts will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company That Comm ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock Maggy Huson Amr Ibrahim Paul Kaufman Harry Kingerski Leslie Lawner Steve Montovano Christi Nicolay Sue Nord Sarah Novosel Linda Robertson Jim Steffes and myself We will also con tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson Harry King erski Sue Nord Linda Robertson Jim Steffes myself Finally I am form ing a DynegyEnron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of Jose Bestard Paul Dawson Paul Kaufman Sue Nord Sarah Novosel and myself No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf ect or permanent I believe these changes will make us better and more pre pared for the future However we must be prepared to further adjust as th e future unfolds for the company One final note I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company We are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr oup fundamentally altered but we must resolve to do our best for each othe r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges f or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy reflects the excelle nce and integrity that has characterized our group Personally I will do all I can for as long as I can to steer the group through this to the ver y best place possible Your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated Hang in there and thanks File

you very much for your response This will be a great addition to the employee response section in our entry to Fortunes Best Companies to Work for Thanks again Courtney Original Message From Rishe Frank Sent Tuesday October PM To Votaw Courtney Subject RE Response Courtney I am pleased to offer my comments on how Enron responded to the events of September th To give you some background I was at the Houston attending meetings at the Enron Building on the th floor when news of the tragedy hit I was originally scheduled to return to New Jersey that evening but as a result of the airport closings I did not get home until late Friday afternoon when I was fortunate enough to be on the first of a number of chartered planes that Enron utilized to facilitate getting employees back to their homes or other destinations The following is a brief outline on how I was affected and how the Company and various employees responded Shortly after the incident an announcement was made on the PA system indicating that the Enron building was in no danger but that anyone who felt uncomfortable being at the office was free to leave This was reassuring particularly for those who were uneasy being on the higher floors The Company wisely shut down the building late that morning so there was no question that employees were free to go Right from the start management made it clear that we could do whatever was needed to get home and that the company would be very flexible with respect to travel expenses during the period while we were unable to get home and in travel getting home An email from Rick Shapiro sent to everyone in the Government Affairs expressing his concerns for everyone served to reinforced what my immediate supervisor and to say the least was reassuring By early Thursday the Company was already making plans to utilized corporate plains to try to facilitate travel for those of us that were stuck one place or another and I was pleasantly surprised when I received a call from Ginger Dernehl saying that I was on the list of people going on the corporate jet up to the New York area whenever the airports opened and that I had to be ready to go on short notice Knowing of three other employees from the New Jersey area that were in the same predicament as I was I gave their names to Ginger Dernehl and Maureen McVicker who were coordinating the list of those needing flights and they immediately got them on the list as well As it turnedout the airports never opened on Thursday so everything was put onhold for another day However it was clear that everyone was doing what ever they could and the thought that kept running through my mind was What a great company to work for The next day Friday I arrived at the Office early only to learn that although some commercial air travel had resumed the ban on corporate air travel was still in effect My alternative at that point was a Continental Flight to Philadelphia but whether or not it would actually go was still a question What I did not know was that the Company was already working on possible chartered flights anticipating that chartered flights might resume before corporate flights Sure enough just as I was about to leave to go to Intercontinental Airport not knowing what nightmarish delays I might encounter I got that call that a chartered flight was leaving for Albany NY ASAP and I had to be at Allen Center right away because there was a van waiting to take me and seven other Enron employees to Hobby Airport About four hours later we arrived at Albany Airport where there were two cars waiting to take us to our various destinations Although it was frustrating at times not knowing when I would actually get home and see my family the genuine concern shown by everyone involved was so reassuring that it greatly minimized whatever inconvenience I was experiencing What a great company to work for If you have any questions or need more details give me a call Frank Original Message

Deregulation Work Gas deregulation unfulfilled promises It was meant to foster competition lower bills and improve customer service for Georgians It hasnt MATTHEW C QUINN STAFF Nov Atlanta JournalAtlanta Constitution Home Page E Copyright The Atlanta Journal and Constitution Three years after Georgia deregulated natural gas theres widespread sentiment the landmark law has failed to live up to its promise and needs to be fixed When the state allowed unregulated marketing companies to sell natural gas to million homes and businesses the goal was to drive prices down and improve service Instead heres what resulted A relentless wave of billing errors confusion and customer service complaints Residential gas prices that remained high even as wholesale prices plunged Tens of thousands of customers whose service was disconnected for nonpayment of bills dating to last winters record cold Marketing companies saddled with millions of dollars in debt resulting from unpaid bills Three marketers have gone bankrupt reducing competition Some survivors appear to be barely hanging on The situation is so strained that players on virtually all sides of the debate now agree that deregulation has gone very wrong No easy fixes are at hand No responsible executive in the world would have ever subjected customers to what theyve had to go through said Paula G Rosput chief executive of AGL Resources parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co which pushed the Legislature to enact deregulation in and remains a monopoly distributor of gas sold by marketers Rosput who joined the company in when deregulation was already under way now says that deregulating natural gas in Georgia was probably swimming against the tide Georgias relatively short heating season offers limited opportunity for profit she said Rosput faults the Public Service Commission for meddling and the marketers for lacking the expertise to do the job properly Theres plenty of blame to go around here she said noting that never in the history of Georgia has the gap between wholesale and retail prices been so wide Gov Roy Barnes has stepped into the morass He plans to name a consumer protection task force to come up with solutions before the Legislature convenes in January Barnes said deregulation has been good for many industrial and business customers but he has profound concerns about the impact on consumers Barnes said hes not out to scrap deregulation Thats a problematic option that nonetheless is expected to be discussed by the task force and the Legislature along with more limited steps to prop up the existing system with consumer protection measures The most immediate problem is households without gas as winter cold sets in According to Atlanta Gas Light more than consumers who were shut off for nonpayment have still not been reconnected The top marketers are insisting that balances be paid in full before service is restored except in certain hardship cases The PSC has allocated million to help lowincome senior citizens pay their bills and the federal government has kicked in million for lowincome families but those measures will help only a small fraction of consumers As a result social services agencies are overwhelmed with pleas for help from gas customers The Sullivan Center a southwest Atlanta nonprofit is holding weekly classes to help advise people having trouble paying their bills Many of them havent paid since last winters frigid temperatures sent bills soaring in Georgia and across the country The PSC responded in January by slapping a moratorium on shut offs but that actually may have exacerbated the situation in the long term When the moratorium expired in April more than customers were targeted for disconnection and marketers were stuck with a reported million in bad debt Since then homes and businesses have been shut off of those were reconnected after paying their bills Nancy D Coveny executive director of Buckhead Christian Ministry which offers assistance to lowincome residents said deregulation has made it more difficult to help people straighten out their accounts because of the multitude of marketers and policies Before deregulation it was a lot easier to straighten out problems Coveny said We would call Atlanta Gas Light We had relationships High prices Jessie Champion of southwest Atlanta said she had her gas cut off after failing to pay a bill dating back months Champion said she had been making budget billing payments to Georgia Natural Gas Services the states top marketer and an affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light and was told by the company that the computer messed up Shes been using an electric heater for her household which includes three grandchildren and a disabled son Catherine LandWaters vice presidentcustomer service at Georgia Natural Gas said Champions service was shut off after she failed to keep up with her payments She said the company has no record of a disability claimed by Champion but added that the company will work with her to get her service restored Denise McGregory of Norcross had her gas shut off two weeks ago after confusion over bills from two marketers for two apartments she briefly had during a move She said Infinite Energy turned off her gas even though she sent a check Service was restored two days later but only after she yelled and screamed and complained to the PSC I have to have gas she said I have seven children Dave Benfield a spokesman for Infinite said McGregory had been notified that she faced disconnection The small Floridabased marketer approved her account for reconnection the same day it received payment If people dont pay us in days they get a notice Benfield said In most cases they pay The PSC has logged more than complaints about natural gas service since January over such things as pricing billing inaccuracies disconnection notices sent in error and demands for payment of hefty overdue balances That dwarfs the number of complaints the PSC gets about electricity and telecommunications People arent being treated right says PSC member Stan Wise a supporter of deregulation who wants to save the system Marketers say many billing problems have been straightened out and complaints to the PSC have tapered off What remains a major concern for virtually everyone involved is the price consumers are paying for natural gas When the wholesale price of gas dropped substantially in recent months residential prices charged by marketers remained high Last week wholesale prices shot up percent in advance of cold weather but are still much lower than last year Marketers say prices have remained high in part because of bad debt they are carrying from nonpaying customers The PSC is expected to launch an inquiry this week into whether bad debt is the reason retail and wholesale prices have been out of synch Its not clear how much is bad debt and how much is marketers taking advantage of the situation said state Consumer Utility Counsel Kristy Holley Reeling from bad debt Residential consumers enjoyed rebates and lower prices at the outset of deregulation Those who locked in fixed prices benefited when prices shot up last winter and their gas costs did not But relatively few customers opted for a fixed price which was not heavily promoted as an option A recent analysis by the PSC staff shows typical monthly residential gas bills between April and September have been higher than those in neighboring states with regulated utilities The average September bill for customers served by Georgia marketers was compared with an average of for six regulated utilities in nearby states Even the lowest Georgia bill was higher than the regulated average But the Georgia bill includes marketer charges for natural gas and customer service plus Atlanta Gas Lights distribution charges PSC member Robert Baker says AGLs charges which account for percent of typical bills may be partly to blame for high bills On the basis of a PSC staff finding that the utility has been earning up to million a year above whats authorized the commission has launched an earnings review that could lead to reduced rates AGL meanwhile claims its entitled to a rate increase of up to million With the exception of large industrial customers that had distribution costs slashed and got more leeway to shop for gas from competing wholesale suppliers its hard to find anyone who gives deregulation high marks Marketers flocked to Georgia with hopes of getting in on the ground floor of an expanding national deregulated business for electricity and natural gas What was supposed to be Georgias gradual transition to an exciting new market with lower prices and superior customer service moved faster than anyone predicted That touched off an array of billing problems and errors When unusually cold weather hit last winter and prices skyrocketed many consumers already angered by the billing problems blamed deregulation and didnt pay their bills While those problems were evolving in Georgia California had its electricity implosion Many marketers had based their investment in Georgia on an expectation theyd recoup by expanding into other markets and offer new services including electricity and telecommunications But the California debacle dashed hopes for a national deregulated market for natural gas and electricity California did for electricity deregulation what Three Mile Island did for nuclear power said Warren Darby retired senior vice president of Scana Energy and now a consultant in Columbia SC When Georgias moratorium on shutoffs expired in April marketers found themselves reeling from an estimated million in bad debt Instead of building market share they had to focus on disconnecting nonpaying customers You went from an invasion to an occupation mentality Darby said Shell Energy an affiliate of Shell Oil Co recently aborted its entry into the newly deregulated electricity market in its home state of Texas The crash program by Georgias No marketer to recoup bad debt by disconnecting nonpaying customers in the state has triggered an outpouring of complaints Darby said Shell is circling the wagons Shell Energy President Alan Raymond concedes that Georgia has not been an exciting profit picture for us but he insists his company has no plans to pull out He added however Unless things get better no company can survive this Georgia Natural Gas Services the states top marketer has been one big headache for AGL Resources its parent which recently took a million pretax charge related to accounting discrepancies at the marketing affiliate and is engaged in messy litigation with a minority partner Its not been a good business for us said Rosput of AGL No marketer Scana Energy has reported million in profit from its Georgia operations so far this year or about per month per customer after accounting for bad debt The South Carolinabased company had hoped to sell its Georgia customers wireless telephone and home security services but has gotten out of both businesses The company says its in for the long term New Power Co made a late and aggressive entry into Georgias natural gas market this year as part of a national push into deregulated gas and electricity markets Wall Street didnt like the idea The companys stock has plunged from a year ago to less than Its top financial backer Enron Corp last month wrote down about million of its investment But New Power President Eugene Lockhart insists Georgia is profitable for the company and that its not planning to pull out Still theres concern about the impact on competition if Shell or New Power quits The PSC has designated New Power as emergency backup supplier if another company goes out of business The ranks of marketers has already thinned from three years ago to eight The top four control percent of the market PSC member Baker already sees an oligopoly with limited competition Consumer choice is supposed to be the hallmark of deregulation said Commissioner David Burgess Instead he said consumers have less and less Reregulation calls So far no one has come forward with a solution to the deregulation problems Calls for reregulation are expected to grow when the General Assembly convenes in January Already a key backer of the deregulation law has jumped ship We cant let Georgia consumers suffer for another year said state Sen Sonny Perdue of Bonaire who said he will introduce legislation to reregulate natural gas Perdue the main Senate sponsor of the deregulation law is expected this week to announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor He would oppose Barnes State Rep Jimmy Skipper DAmericus the main House sponsor of the law said hes concerned about gas prices but hes not sure reregulation is doable at this point Marketers are pressing for more time to give deregulation a chance We believe a year from now weather permitting that this will be a much calmer market and people will value the choices they have saId Scana spokeswoman Cathy Love Returning to regulated natural gas would present a whole new host of problems including dilemma No If its reregulated who takes the ball says PSC Chairman Lauren Bubba McDonald Jr Returning Atlanta Gas Light to the role of regulated utility would require the very expensive proposition of reconstructing billing and customer service systems for million customers which was turned over to marketers Then theres the question of whether marketers would be entitled to a bailout to recover their costs if forced from the market Georgia invited them into One option being discussed is to have Atlanta Gas Light or even a marketer offer a regulated gas service alongside unregulated marketers That would make Georgia more like other states that have deregulated Other measures could include new standards for billing customer service and meter reading more authority for the PSC including emergency power to regulate prices reducing the sales tax for gas bills and increasing competition by allowing nonprofit electric cooperatives to become gas marketers But there are significant problems associated with every option that has been floated for fixing deregulation In fact there may be no good fix Rosput said shes prepared to get to a solution but like everyone else she doesnt have an answer It is my job to do the best I can to guide this ship she said and theres no safe shore or good place to land
