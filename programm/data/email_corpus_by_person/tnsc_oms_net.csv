Circumstances Our websites advice section gets questions on a wide variety of topics from all over the world Recently a web visitor posed a question that many of us face Often as our own children are establishing themselves as adults were faced with issues relating to care for older relatives Heres our readers question and our response Convincing Elders To Accept Care Question As a hospitalgeriatric social worker both in my personal and work life I am frequently asked the following question My elderly parent aunt neighbor clearly needs some help at home but refuses this help even if free or done by a family member a church How can I convince this person to accept help After Ive determined that the issue isnt financial usually a solvable problem then I am frequently at a loss The situations Ive seen like this seem to only resolve after a crisis occurs and the person has no choice How would you approach a situation like this The issues seem to revolve around pride retaining control denial of illness aging or disability Any thoughts Response In his Notes From The Underground Dostoevsky wrote Human behavior is motivated by the craving for absolute freedom and selfassertion in defiance of all dictates of reason As decrepitude takes its toll on our bodies and minds often pride is the only thing we have left Waiting for a crisis is excruciating for folks who think of themselves as caregivers when it comes to organizing care for people who have less and less capacity to take care of themselves or their personal surroundings Probably the wisest thing to do is ask a whole lot of questions Using the example of children of an elderly parent first the concerned children need to ask themselves what are their own interests Do they want to assuage guilt Do they fear that harm will come to their parent Are they concerned that a crisis will interrupt the normal course of their own lives Questions also need to be asked of the parent What most concerns you about your situation health comfortable surroundings companionship your capacity to hold your head up and say Daughter please I can do it myself One can also ask What do you think are the standards that determine ones capacity to live an independent life This questioning approach brings the parties into fuller participation in the decisionmaking process When I ask you a question it means I am taking you seriously the reverse is equally true In negotiation this technique is called Active Listening The crucial element is listening closely to all the elements of the responses to those questions both the questions one asks oneself and the questions asked of other people It is no less important to respond to what people say by checking to make sure youve understood their points you may want to say This is what I understood you to have said is my understanding correct You also want to indicate The fact that I understand what you have said does not necessarily mean I agree with you Clinging on to the visual indicators of independence is a critical vital sign The fear of loving relatives that something bad can happen has to be balanced against the knowledge that if you kick someone in their selfesteem you are attacking a most vulnerable part of their anatomy You cannot negotiate away a persons selfesteem but you can destroy it through frontal and flanking attacks The frustration faced by folks who see loved ones failing to take proper care of themselves is phenomenal Very often the people who have advocated professional care ultimately must mutter hopefully to themselves the unsatisfying statement I told you so In your question you indicate that crisis forces choice Perhaps the best approach is to prepare a safety net that is ready when the crisis occurs It cannot prevent a crisis from happening and it is crucial to make sure that a crisis is not worsened by forcing the victim of it to lose face But having that safety net ready can at least reduce the force of the fall Relationship is one of the seven most significant issues to consider in negotiation Focusing on the relationship with an elderly parent or friend not letting decrepitude get in the way of love and caring can make it much easier when someones selfesteem is attacked by a crisis Looking at oneself and saying Its not my fault is not a way of avoiding blame but rather giving a loved one the freedom to make their own mistakes just as they did the first time they gave us the keys to the car TNSC NEWS The Negotiation Skills Companys website wwwnegotiationskillscom is now getting
