Young Steve Sent Wednesday November PM To Gadd Eric Cc McCarty Danny Subject Gila Bend TECOPanda deals Sensitivity Confidential Eric I spoke earlier today with the banker who led the TECOPanda financing for Societe Generale lead arranger with Citi on the bill merchant project financing Following is a summary of the call with healthy amount of detail since it may be some time before we have a chance to visit Due to confidentialities Jim could only go so far on some details so youll note a number of gaps however this should cover many of your questions Call upon return after the holiday and we can discuss further Also attached after notes is an article that should capture many of the financing details Given other demands Ive not yet read the article so duplication between the notes and article is inevitable A word of caution PFI details are good but not always accurate so rely principally on the call notes I also asked for portions of the Offering Memo but am doubtful on receiving this Distribute further as you see fit Summary of Call This was a merchant financing with both projects Phoenix and El Dorado Arkansas crosscollateralized and xdefaulted so treated as a single financing Approx MW per site for total of MW with separate units per site Sources of funding Total of Bill Bill in debt and MM in funded equity Apparently all of the MM equity was funded at close June further confirmation is needed Of the Bill in debt Bill was nonrecourse and MM was an equity bridge with recourse to partners However lenders looked principally to TECOs credit backed by several guaranty of equity bridge and fronting of the MM in funded equity Partnership in all respects ie vote and economics However TECO must have some preferential rights eg cash flows etc given their substantial commits on the deal Term of debt yrs construct facility plus yr miniperm with bullet at maturity approx amortized at maturity Five years is the market for merchant deals Amortization is yr mortgage style A expected form of permanent takeout of term debt Leverage financed by term debt but approx debt financed when adding all ancillary facilities and other commits ie working capital letters of credit etc Jim kept details to minimum but further info is needed here Key Ratio was debt service coverage Base Case assumed an average DSCR of X and Min of X with cash trapped at X Did not get detail on whether DSCR was both historical and forward looking but suspect there was some kind of forward test Project finance banks typically expect to DSCR on merchant finance deals Leverage DSCR and structure in general was done based on what is generally required to gain investment grade rating from agencies when permanent takeout is sought Additional rating agency requirements can be found on Moodys and SP web sites TECO also will act as operator TECO was clearly crucial to deal and at least Soc Gen had done prior deals with them not sure about Citi Panda brought TECO into the deals Although Panda was a known quantity Soc Gen had no direct project history with them Fuel and Power Off take Lenders looked to extensive an Energy Management Program analysis The EMP presumed by COD of fuel and power would be under firm contract of each would be covered by seasonal swing contracts and remaining would remain merchant Intention is a complete match term and volumes for fuel and power contracts Agency agreements were signed with Noble yr contract on fuel supply mgt and Aquilla yr contract for managing power sales Each buys in name of the projects TECO is responsible for overall energy mgt and coordination between Noble and Aquilla Jim said EOD is triggered if fuel and power agreements are not signed in line with EM Program by COD Lenders got comfortable with lack of fuel and power contracts due to substantial equity commitment approx Bill Consultants were Pace for fuel supply and overall energy management and RW Beck for power market eval Fuel Transport Much of medium term contracted at close mix of firm and interruptible capacity out to yrs Lenders looked to new and released capacity to fill noncontracted needs Original Message From Young Steve Sent

California Sonoran Rationale Lower costs higher margins Greater capacity economic scale expansion options Reduced stakeholder interventions Navajos environmental interests groups shippers Reduced regulatory process Background On May Kinder Morgan and Calpine announced plans to jointly develo p the Sonoran Pipeline subject to customary approvals and sufficient inter est by potential shippers As proposed the Sonoran pipeline will be a mile high pressure interstate natural gas pipeline from the San Juan Bas in in northern New Mexico to markets in California The project with an e stimated cost of billion will provide natural gas transportation capa city to California to serve growing electric generation demand The proposed pipeline will be evaluated and developed in two phases The f irst phase will run from the San Juan Basin to the California border with t he second phase extending from the California border to the San Francisco B ay area The first phase of the pipeline is expected to be completed in the summer o f Phase one will consist of a mile inch diameter pipeline fr om the interconnection of TransColorado Gas Transmission and Transwestern P ipeline to various points at the Blanco Hub in San Juan NM In addition the pipeline will continue westward with deliveries into the CaliforniaAri zona border A mile inch diameter lateral would be built to Topock AZ The initial capacity would start with dthd with capability to expand to million dthday The estimated cost of phase one is wi th a targeted inservice date of summer Sponsors said the open seaso n will seek at a

public arena I felt the stories in the Calgary Herald National Post were unfortunate in timing and substance As per your suggestion I have eliminated the last bullets and attached t he talking points here The last bullet in the revised talking points was devised to take media pressure off of both us and the Producers There has been an incredible amount of political hay being made with this project an d it has realized an inordinate amount of media attention We need to give the media only if asked or questioned not to be released some reasonab le expectations for time frames In any discussions we have with governmen t bodies or if questioned by media representatives we need to make it very clear we cannot discuss the terms of the proposal at this time and help the m understand that the Producers will have only received an executive summar y and the meeting in January will be the first glance at a large complex pr oposal and is intended to be the beginning of a process Outlining this ti meframe clearly stating there will be no immediate results from either rece iving the proposal or the early January meeting will hopefully set the medi a and government minds at rest that there is no story here for a while so n o need to dig further Normally a timeframe and a process is a better answ er than no comment Please let me know if you have any other concerns or would like to see addi

Coughlin Michelle Thomas Peter C Subject RE ANGTS Commercial Proposal Executive Summary Dec Versi on Michelle my comments are very much based on the impact of comments as seen recently in TCPLs Calgary Herald article followed by the scaled down pipeline article published by the Petroleum News Alaska I firmly believe the less said in public before jan discussions with producers the better off we are we do not want to negotiate this deal in public Id prefer to keep advertisements down to a minimum and keep to the staight and narrow for now hence collapse the third and fourth bullets into one very concise bullet indicating a proposal being sent before year end to be followed up by a meeting in early Jan I would not say anything further about whats in the proposal nor the attributes Again in the less said the better mode Id delete the last two bullets I appreciate Tonys email on Mr Kvisles comments and timing and can understand how these types of things occur It indicates to me we need to keep to a very tight script in all discussions media and politicians alike until we make meaningful progress with the customer hence my desire to keep the talking points as brief as possible so we have the most integrity with producers Ill defer to the collective wisdom of the group since I have no real editorial comments on your talking points my real comment is policywise to keep them as brief as possible ie all we really need to say right now is were going to be meeting with producers in early jan on a pipeline proposal Thanks Coughlin Michelle Michelle il To Bruce Scott

<22565745.1075852174960.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,eric.gadd@enron.com,2001-10-05 08:00:46,ANNGTC MOU Comments Cc Danny Heres our comments Paragraph ANNGTCs FERC Form filing says that they have received rate base approval for approx million of past investment not including AFUDC It is unclear how the total cash investment of the withdrawn partners relates to the million number in the Form We acknowledge that releasing any and all potential claims against the ANNGTC Partnership is an important principle to adopt to secure commercial commitments from the ANS Producers In principle we are prepared to release claims for the accrued AFUDC component but are not prepared to release claims for the MM of past investment because regulators may allow a recovery mechanic which could present future upsides to the Withdrawn Partners We thus propose to modify this principle to provide for the inclusion of the MM but specifically exclude the AFUDC component Ultimately the toll for transport services will result through negotiations with the ANS Producers and their concerns can be addressed by expressly excluding surchargesother regulatory mechanics approved by the regulators for the initial investments Par footnote Each ANS Producer that joins will cause the Current and Rejoining Partners interests to be reduced pro rata irrespective of when the new partners join We should discuss limits on the rights of new partners to join or a limits on the dilution Section of the partnership agreement sets out a mechanism that discounts the percentage interest acquired by a new partner depending on how long after initial formation that partner joined If that mechanism is still in effect any ANS Producer who joins will face the unpleasant surprise that his interest will immediately be discounted by Paragraph a We have no information supporting MM of costs incurred by TCPLUSA and UAFCFoothills for and The language is ambiguous on what will happen to the costs incurred by TCPLUSA and UAFCFoothills prior to How much money did they spend and are they offering to write it off Does our payment of our pro rata share of the million permanently absolve us of responsiblity for those costs or have they been buried in the accounts of the partnership somewhere Paragraph b The idea of a success payment implies that an entirely new set of customers for the pipeline will be found and new contracts executed At one time Northern Natural was a shipper and we believe may have signed a precedent agreement or binding contract we think the original partners agreed to also contract as customers We havent seen the agreements but assume they are dead If not we need to kill them Enron believes it is inappropriate for TCPLUSA and UAFCFoothills to obtain a success paymentdistribution equal to US MM The parents of both companies will enjoy the benefit of increased revenues resulting from volume flows on BC segments owned by themselves which should be a significant financial incentive NB We could advance the idea of asking for an option on participation on the BC leg next week if Foothills and TCPL wont back off on demanding the million Id prefer not to put this in writing yet Paragraph While we would like to to preserve the potential ability of the Partnership to seek to include the entire balance of capital contributions plus AFUDCinterest in rate base since that is almost US b doing so would crater the projects economics Instead preserving just the projects ability to include in rate base the MM that FERC has already blessed may be a more reasonable amount and also have the benefit of prior FERC approval Paragraph A Rejoining Partner who subsequently withdraw should be allowed to recover its capital contributions without interestAFUDC at some future date preferably the first day of commercial operations New Percentage Interest will revert to all partners in proportion to their respective current percentage interests Paragraph Enron would like to eliminate this principle It would be appropriate for change of control principles to be developed Paragraph Please clarify the principles in which the Partnership Agreement will be amended in order to modernize provisions for the management of the ANNGTC Partnership Paragraph We couldnt find equalizing partners referenced as a defined term so were not sure what this paragraph is talking about It might be referring to the Additional Capital provisions of Par but thats just a guess Paragraph Enron can not agree to the principles in a and b Paragraph Williams acquisition of NAPC introduces a material change in control and needs to be discussed The size of ANNGTC is such that it could hire its own pipeline operating management and staff in Alaska NB We need to determine when Williams acquired control of NAPC Drew is investigating Paragraph Wed like to take this out of whatever MOU we end up signing for the same reason we took it out of the confidentiality agreement This is just a paraphrase of the withdrawing partner provisions of the Partnership Agreement coupled with some speculation about what might happen or more years from now It doesnt need to be in the MOU The only thing this language accomplishes is potentially exposing us to an argument that we waived some rights or were on notice of some claim or position if we end up in a fight with Foothills TCPL or the Partnership Balance of MOU Ok

submit separate applications on phase one NM AZ and phase two CA of th e Sonoran Pipeline Reportedly FERC rejected the approach advising KM to come back when they could make an application on the full project This p robably delays their filing timetable because the California leg will be si gnificantly more difficult to market environmental stakeholders are likely to be more adversarial and the probability of activist NIMBY landowners i s high Does anybody know when KM plans to file their application Is Phase one in service of summer feasible if an application for the full pipeline is required How long would it take KM to prepare the phase two application for the Sonoran project Please keep this info confidential Also it would be helpful if you could corroborate through your sources Original Message From Gadd Eric SentWednesday September PM ToMcCarty Danny CcHyatt Kevin SubjectKinder Morgan Sonoran Project Danny Today Kevin and I met with Scott Parker KMI Ron Brown KMI and Chad D riscoll Calpine to discuss possibilities of bundling Kinder Morgans Sono ran project with Sun Devil A summary of our discussions is outlined below Concept Explore the possibility of combining the Sun Devil and Sonoran Pipeline pro jects into a single venture along the existing Transwestern route from San Juan to the California Border Progress separate projects for service to P hoenix Sun Devil and California Sonoran Rationale Lower costs higher margins Greater capacity economic scale expansion options Reduced stakeholder interventions Navajos environmental interests groups shippers Reduced regulatory process Background On May Kinder Morgan and Calpine announced plans to jointly develo p the Sonoran Pipeline subject to customary approvals and sufficient inter est by potential shippers As proposed the Sonoran pipeline will be a mile high pressure interstate natural gas pipeline from the San Juan Bas in in northern New Mexico to markets in California The project with an e stimated cost of billion will provide natural gas transportation capa city to California to serve growing electric generation demand The proposed pipeline will be evaluated and developed in two phases The f irst phase will run from the San Juan Basin to the California border with t he second phase extending from the California border to the San Francisco B ay area The first phase of the pipeline is expected to be completed in the summer o f Phase one will consist of a mile inch diameter pipeline fr om the interconnection of TransColorado Gas Transmission and Transwestern P ipeline to various points at the Blanco Hub in San Juan NM In addition the pipeline will continue westward with deliveries into the CaliforniaAri zona border A mile inch diameter lateral would be built to Topock AZ The initial capacity would start with dthd with capability to expand to million dthday The estimated cost of phase one is wi th a targeted inservice date of summer Sponsors said the open seaso n will seek at a minimum year term commitments at a fixed transport rat e of dth for firm transportation Sonoran proposes to charge shipper s actual fuel on phase one via a fuel tracker Fuel is estimated at More than billion cubic feet per day of binding agreements and nonbindi ng expressions of interest were received for the first phase of the project Phase two will be a mile inch diameter pipeline from Needles on the California border to points within California terminating near Antioch in Contra Costa County Once completed the pipeline will be able to transpo rt between million and million dthday The inservice date for the phase two has yet to be determined The cost is projected to be billi on Another Bcfd of nonbinding commitments and expressions of inter est were received for phase two Sonoran has already received binding bids from Calpine Energy Services for dthd for phase one and another dthd for its phase two On ce completed the new pipeline could connect with Kern River Mojave Elk H ills Pacific Gas and Electric Southern California Gas and various gasfir ed power plants SoCalGass Residual Load Service RLS penalty woull not affect the Sonoran project because the pipeline route parallels PGEs pipelines and the prim ary target load is new gasfired generation not within SoCalGass market te rritory The pipeline also will connect to a new underground storage facility near L odi being developed by Lodi Gas Storage Inc a subsidiary of Houston base d Western Hub Properties LLC The project could have a noteworthy coowner the Navajo Nation the sovere ign government of residents on the largest Indian reservation withi n the United States An agreement in principle to give the Navajos an owne rship interest in the billion pipeline that crosses their reservation was disclosed in August by an executive of Kinder Morgan at Indian Energy a conference of the Council of Energy Resource Tribes that highlighted the growing role Indian tribes play in powering the West As part of the deal to secure that right of way the Navajo Nation would invest in the pro ject and receive a minority interest when the pipeline opens The deal wou ld be structured to limit the tribes exposure to risks during the construc tion phase of the project Gas from the pipeline could also fuel a propose d Navajoowned power plant on the reservation Red Cedar Gas Gathering
