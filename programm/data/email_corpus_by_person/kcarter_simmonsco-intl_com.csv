by Kerry CarterSCI on PM Dan Pickering To Everyone cc AM Subject Thoughts on the world of energy OSX XNG XOI This went to our institutional clients this morningDRP Dan Pickering Simmons Company International Louisiana Suite Houston TX phone fax email Forwarded by Dan PickeringSCI on AM Dan Pickering To Sales Trading cc AM Subject Thoughts on the world of energy OSX XNG XOI SUMMARY At or near inflection points stock calls are all about the big picture This is particularly true of cyclicals like energy Although execution is always important for differentiating between companies company specifics mean relatively little to investors right now compared to the big picture We believe the broad market and energy stocks particularly oil and gas stocks currently discount an economic recovery in H and that commodity prices will not crater and will begin to improve with economic conditions Valuation for energy stocks is neither particularly cheap nor expensive at this point in the cycle Hard to hate them hard to love them moves in either direction would create more interest from us to buy or to sell Would call news over the weekend particularly Russian as negative especially in light of the light volume rally on Friday which has put the stocks ahead of where they should be on a trading basis THE BIG PICTURE Crude oil fundamentals and pricing are appropriately the current focus of investors and this has been driving energy stocks on a trading basis We arent going to be disappointed by the amount of news flow as many issues will be relatively quick to play out within the next several months Russia Recent news is negative Promised reduction in output from kday to kday is a disappointment and makes future OPEC cuts and compliance more risky Volume reductions will be revisited on December th but nearterm damage has been done Conclusion downward pressure Iraq Nothing is obvious about Iraq Sanctions renewal is coming up in just a few weeks News is surprisingly quiet on this front with pricing mechanism complaints the only recent commentary from Iraqi government Intriguing that Russia scuttled the USBritain calls for smart sanctions last renewal period but now have much more to gain by encouraging events that prompt Iraq to leave the export market boost crude prices and help Russia win on both volume and price However Russian companies are the big winners in rejuvenating Iraqi oilfields so do they want to alienate Iraq here A blurb over the weekend that Iraq caught some Iranian plotters against Saddam Hussein which adds to overall confusion on the Iraqi situation Conclusion Upside pressure War In Afghanistan Current successes are good for the economy and crude demand but also reduces the nearterm risk of supply disruptions War premium coming out of crude Conclusion Downward pressure EconomyEnergy Fundamentals Recent US economic datapoints appear to be modestly better than experts have predicted Europe as bad as expected Japan remains dismal Lower crude and gasoline prices are nice stimulus for disposable income just in time for Xmas shopping However even if shoppers are mobbing Wal Mart worldwide energy demand still appears to be falling on the margin Crude inventories rising at a brisk pace vs historical norms for this time of year and more OPEC and nonOPEC cuts and compliance are needed to maintain a price in the highteenslow barrel level Conclusion Nearterm downside pressure but glimmers of hope via economy USEurope Political Issues You have to assume that US and European governments care more about reasonably priced or cheap crude oil to stimulate the economy than anything else but also dont want economic chaos in the Middle East We continue to gather intelligence from our Washington contacts that the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve will be used to support prices but not until WTI crude is in the midteens Conclusion Modest downward pressure IsraelPalestine More violence over the long weekend Still no signs that OPEC countries taking a significant stance on this issue Watch the rhetoric that will come before any action on OPECs part Conclusion Neutral with more likely upside pressure than downside pressure Enron Situation If ENE craters the impact on energy markets is unquantified but certainly significant Who knows about what ripple effects could and are occurring Conclusion Natural Gas Warm weather and weak industrial demand are a bad combo Thank your lucky stars that it was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving when last weeks ugly AGA gas inventory numbers were reported Falling gas rigcount is the only near term savior and that is occurring Gas problems will work themselves out faster than crude and hence our bias toward gassy stocks note that the street has also figured this out as the gassy names have had the best performance off the bottom Conclusion Stinky and everyone knows it Trading influence only Investors are really watching crude oil for the next big move in either direction for the stocks STOCKS Overall incorporating fundamentals sentiment and valuation the sector is closer to a buy than a sell In June we worried about shoes that could drop as a result of the soft economy Nat gas prices and sentiment Crude oil prices and sentiment Earnings expectations All three have happened and it will take a lot of bad news on the items discussed above to take energy stocks to new lows OSX XNG That doesnt imply a huge run to new highs either The problems in OPEC have shaken investor confidence and therefore we think that energy will lag in a rally of the cyclicals It has become boring to write the concluding paragraphs of these notes as the conclusion has not changed much Big investors should go against the grain and buy the hard down
