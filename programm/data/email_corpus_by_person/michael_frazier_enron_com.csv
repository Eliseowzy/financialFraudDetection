received from meters that we monitor The data will be made available to Enron in a manner to be specified If the data has been VEEd validated edited and estimated the fields should be marked as actual or estimated This should not be an issue on a daily basis because the data is not put through the VEE process until the end of the billing cycle when it is passed to MDMA It is understood by Enron that there may be missing data in this report ie missed meters missed time periods They do not require that they be notified of this missing data with the understanding that all such missing data appears is an later report This report should include all data received by MV for each meter that day Enron asks that an initial report be generated containing the output for part of a day and sent to the Requestor for evaluation and determination of final data field need The requestor will respond following receipt of this file with any changes in data fields required A second test files would then be forwarded containing several days output in order to allow the Requestor to gauge daily information and volume The requestor will respond following receipt of this second files with final approval to complete the project I have one concern with the wording above It seems to confuse normal estimation requirements which is partly designed to fill in missing observations like a couple of hours with data missing due to a downed phone line or no meter answer which would be backfilled in subsequent files as you note Also while we may choose to duplicate CSCs process of implementing required VEE rules we need to understand what is required to do so Is it to our benefit to do so I have sent you separately the link to a site where you can review just what CSC is supposedly doing to comply with CAISO rules Would an issue arise of consistency between the VEE rules applications by CSC if different than EWS I never realized that VEE was applied only at the end by the MV system Are

picpcx AM To Chris nronXgate Michael ES cc Richard ES Maurice ES Kenny ES Steven ES Subject WIP for MV data Steve Heres a quick synopsis of what we need Users want actual historical metered data If they cant get the data before it has been EEVd by MV they need to know for each value whether it is the actual metered amount or an estimated value Users understand that there may be missing data but do not require the metadata detailing this However this is with the understanding that the backfill data will eventually arrive at some later date We want any account and meterdescriptive data as well as the associated volumetric data A test file to see what kind of data are available and a few consecutive days worth of data to get a feel for volumes are needed If data is received from am how soon after am can we get a file Please do not burn in this process just yet because data and timing requirements may change Chris With the bullets above Steve has promised to turn around the completed WIP by COB today or tomorrow morning Hopefully this will at least get the ball rolling It is then up to the business to determine whether to proceed and how to prioritze it There must be concerted effort from the business to prioritize requests to CSC Steve gave me Richard Millers name as the EES coordinator for these requests Please contact him and let me know what you find out Going forward we MUST establish who is responsible for filling these things out and keeping track of them Ive heard different things from different people and I dont want to end up nor should anyone else being the person

initiative from the time I became involved to the time the scope of the effort was limited My understanding from my notes and recollections and a discussion with Glen Matthys this morning is as follows Team Ranger is cosponsored by Greg Young Scott Mills and Mary Lynn Ruffer Team Rangers objective is to capture all the data necessary for Ruffer to provide flash reports to Mills on what should liquidated from the risk book vs actual costs and revenues experienced Youngs involved because his Operations group provides the link to CSCs billing and invoicing systems Since I had been discussing my forecasting data needs and RPS tieins with Scott he viewed this as an opportunity for the organization to gather more information than strictly needed to meet this objective and invited me to lobby for an expanded scope Clearly I was outvoted since the subsequent scope was severely restricted to retrieving only the financial data that is readily available to CSC and which will enable flash report development quickly for power only an expanded scope would have compromised timely deliverables The system will pull down monthly data from STAT and LodeStar billing systems on a daily frequency and will still provide some valuable information for me The data collected for Team Ranger will be housed in an Enroncontrolled database not CSCs supposedly for easy access to Enron users Chris this clearly falls in the realm we were discussing last night a limited scope silo initiative to solve a localized problem Like I said Im a culprit too if no one else wants to provide the data I need Ill pull it myself just as you counseled a month ago when we were struggling to get answers from CSC via Operations I admit you were right weve gotten more data since then with access privileges than I could have wrangled out of requests to CSC in six months despite California Let me know what else you need from me to facilitate your efforts Please keep me updated with what you learn and where we stand Ill do the same Michael Forwarded by Michael FrazierHOUEES on PM Enron Energy Services From Scott Mills AM To Michael ES cc Subject Meeting you would be interested in There is a meeting scheduled for Monday see below to discuss information that must be provided by CSC and Avista so that we can start tying out what is actually billed to what is in the Risk books This is a lot of the same information that I know you are trying to get your hands around If you are interested in attending please do so If you are not available give me some data points so that nothing is overlooked This will be the first of many get togethers Evan Hughes and his group will be there to represent what we are currently getting from the outsource providers as well as what we are collecting

Michael ES Anthony ES Anthony ES Christina ES Subject Re AR Accruals Mtg Reminder After looking at this a couple of thoughts Assuming that we will create a global repository that will support everyones needs for all EES activity purchases and sells Internal as well as outsource data Outsource data needs to be Enronized consistent internal formatting of field values We should be able to use the GCPEES Settlement System cross reference mapping that is set up and maintained by Global Counterparty as a way to get to Enrons Global Counterparty number This should be a daily feed We will need the same information for payments Additional information needed in the file EES Entity transacting Business Commodity eg power gas Covered Service eg commodity projects AOPS Flow Begin Date Flow End Date Volume Volume Frequency eg daily monthly total for period Volume Status eg estimated actual Price Type eg Commodity Tax Rate Schedule if applicable eg Name of Utility Rate Class Rate Name if

USD CAD etc Joni how different is the information in this file compared to what Mike Newlin is getting on a daily basis for the Credit Aggregation process Should what Mike is getting be coordinated with this process The one advantage that I can see now is the ability to get an aged open AR Balance Mary Lynne is there any additional information from what you are having pulled now for reconciliation of prior months Michael from your requirements that you are already discussing regarding volumes is there anything else How different is this from the Tax Project extract that was discussed can these efforts be consolidated I will have Christina schedule a meeting for further discussion SRM x Enron Energy Services From Kimberley Nelson PM To Evan ES Kimberley ES Mary Lynne ES

<3903650.1075858518228.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,michael.frazier@enron.com,2001-06-01 10:06:46,Retail load in California Cc NonPrivilegedpst It is my understanding that agreements are imminent to begin the process of returning EESs residential customers in California to bundled service under their respective utilities This will reduce load in all congestion zones roughly by an average MW in the south and MW in the north This cumulative load reduction will be phased in over the course of a full billing month as customer meters are read in their normal cycles For now the timing is uncertain but I assume load reductions could begin as soon as midJune These developments will be reflected in future forecast schedules Details will be sent you as soon as they are available Michael
