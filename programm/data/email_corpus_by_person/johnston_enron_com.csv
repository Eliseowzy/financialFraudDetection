<30851243.1075857702410.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,johnston@enron.com,2001-02-16 13:54:29,California pt Cc reports the following regarding todays developments In sum due to the governors sudden panic and resultant willingness to negotiate all parties are in a waitandsee mode that makes it unclear whether or not there will be an involuntary bankruptcy filing early next week Our consensus view is that bankruptcy is still the most likely outcome but the timing is subject to the ups and downs of these negotiations over the weekend Creditors especially the small IPPs are close to the end on forbearance and highly frustrated with the erratic nature of the negotiations The events given in this report are chronological The original plan proposed by Governor Davis to the utilities this morning contained the following points The parent companies of the utilities would have to return to their subsidiaries billion This money was originally tranferred to the parent companies ostensibly so that the parents could use it to pay taxes However as was revealed in the audit this money was in excess of what was needed for taxes in reality The state would purchase the transmission assets for billion It was proposed that the utilities would issue bonds to pay for the utilities undercollection These bonds would be secured against a distribution charge added to power bills This money would be collected by DWR and transferred to the utilities thereby involving the state but with less than a full faith and credit commitment In contradiction to preliminary reports that appeared in the press this plan was rejected by the utilities One reason for this rejection was the low price on the transmission assets While the bondholders pressed for further negotiations at this point in order to see if a deal could be reached this is because the bondholders are less impaired than the generators The generators however demanded that they be paid the money they are owed and threatened to move quickly toward an involuntary bankrtupcy filing Local sources report that Governor Davis panicked at this point He then offered to purchase the transmission assets for billion almost twice the earlier offer and pay the generators undercollection which amounts to to billion Reportedly the suggested term of the bonds that would be used to pay for this bailout was years which would nearly double the actual cost of the bailout This plan would be put forward as a emergency legislative bill At this point consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield entered into negotiations with the state treasurers office Rosenfield threatened that if the governor managed to pass this plan he would start a referendum to counter it Rosenfield would have up to days after the emergency bill was passed to put his referendum in place Knowledgeable sources advise that it would be very difficult for the bonds in the plan to be issued in less than days therefore Rosenfield poses a credible threat In subsequent negotiations Governor Davis has offered to purchase the transmission assets for a price of at least billion but possibly as high as billion Senator President Pro Tem John Burton is very upset with the governor for giving in on his negotiations so easily Mike Florio another consumer advocate contacted Gov Davis and said that the idea of negotiating a bailout as it appeared Davis intended to do was ridiculous Florio and the other consumer advocates threatened to ally themselves with Rosenfield and support the referendum if Davis pursued such a course of action The consumer advocates strongly feel that the generators have to take a hair cut as part of the solution as well The governor will announce later this afternoon a framework solution identical to that we have reported previously a state purchase of transmission assets and an issuance of bonds by the utilities but with state support through the DWR However the state government has yet to reach consensus on the numbers in this framework and it remains unclear whether the framework will be acceptable to all parties With this announcement the bondholders may refrain from an involuntary filing in order to see what the terms of the final agreement will be The generators while more inclined to file themselves may feel that they have put enough pressure on the governor that it may be worthwhile to wait and see as well They are interested not only in the terms of the agreement and particularly the amount paid for the undercollect but also in the terms of the longterm power contracts that the state must negotiate For example if the state is willing to purchase power at high prices in order to placate the generators they would be very likely to go along with the plan 
<219928.1075857702438.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,johnston@enron.com,2001-02-13 05:43:50,California Cc contact Robert Johnston at x Court Case Denies Rate Hikes As forecast in our report yesterday the Federal Court in Los Angeles refused to allow the two California utilities to raise rates to recoup undercollections of their power costs since last August We had expected that the court would rule in favor of the utilities but push the rate hike question to an appeals court Instead Judge Ronald Lew refused to rule on the case because of technical considerations and postponed a hearing until March th The utilities now face an imminent end to creditor forbearance without the prospect of shortterm rate hikes Edison reaches the end of its grace period for a million payment today and a million payment on Thursday Absent the political cover of the court to impose rate hikes the Governor and the state legislature are in an equally tenuous position Bankruptcy Grows More Likely Regardless of the legal technicalities the bottom line is the same As we have cautioned since last Wednesday there is a serious risk that a creditor or group of creditors could push for bankruptcy perhapsas soon as tomorrow when the period of forbearance agreed to by financial creditors runs out Before this ruling there was reasonable assurance that the utilities would be restored to health by their court victory Now there is real fear a coherent deal is unravelling and that it will not take much for a small group of financial creditors to break ranks And the prospects for supplier creditors now look much bleaker and more dangerous And there is an increased temptation for the utilities to declare bankruptcy and take their chances with a judge rather than the California assembly The politicians will try to find a way to prevent bankruptcy but it will now be difficult Disarray in the Legislature For now the only card still being played is the I give you a dollar you give me a hot dog plan as State Senator Burton accurately summed it up The state pumps money into the utilities in return for some kind of asset warrants transmission lines whatever anything that can be brandished in front of the voters as proof that the utilities suffered and paid But there is little or no energy among legislators for either of the proposed solutions one senior figure in Sacramento told our source yesterday afternoon Legislators are running scared And I dont know of a single legislator in either house on either side who has the slightest sympathy for the utiltiies now They think the utiltiies have either been incompetent or shrewd or both The ruling will in all likelihood send officials back to the drawing board Davis will propose a kind of shadow plan by Friday but there will be no real substance in it What are we supposed to do in just four days There will not be a real substantive plan for three weeks I think at the earliest That period of uncertainty and lack of energy in the legislature could panic the creditors now Bankruptcy Court If Davis fails to cobble together a lastminute deal for rate hikes and some kind of purchase of transmission assets then all parties will have to do a workout in federal bankruptcy court The most likely scenario which we flagged last week is that the small IPPs file an involuntary bankruptcy against Edison followed possibly by PGE Involuntary bankruptcy would shield the utilities from creditor lawsuits and temporarily relieve them from debt payments There is also speculation in the press this morning that some creditors are talking about a Ch or liquidation proceeding but that cannot yet be confirmed by sources
<30333033.1075857702520.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,johnston@enron.com,2001-02-09 09:12:52,California Power Cc information is from sensitive sources Please treat with discretion Contact Robert Johnston x or Kristin Walsh x for questions or additional info Bankruptcy Early this week there was a closed door meeting held by the Western Power Trading Forum in Arizona The meeting took place outside California to avoid press coverage and allow IPPs to maintain a low profile Association representatives believe that regardless of what happens with the PUC vs Utilities ruling expected on Monday some IPPs will take the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy Our source expects that absent a significant last minute breakthrough the filing will happen within the next two weeks and probably next week As stated in yesterdays report the IPPs are very low on cash and are not able to cover the debts of the PGE and Socal Only three creditors are needed with uncollected debts of more than to file involuntary bankruptcy Bail Out Davis has been meeting with the chief executives of both utilities in a last ditch effort to make a deal prior to Mondays court ruling The most likely scenario is for state ownership of the utilities transmissions assets However coming to an agreed upon price will be very challenging In addition PGE and Edison appear to have competing agendas in pursuing a bail out plan Davis is expect to continue meetings through out the weekend in hopes of reaching an agreement before Monday
<14806269.1075857702566.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,johnston@enron.com,2001-02-12 06:27:43,California Update Cc Summary The likelihood of there being an involuntary bankruptcy filing against the utilities appears to be greater than This is not only due to the circumstances surrounding the filed rate doctrine case mentioned below but also because the day cure period during which the utilities have not been paying their bills will end this week increasing the likelihood that their IPP creditors will act against them If the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today which it is believed will happen and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing or even the threat of one this bailout plan will be enacted quickly Utilities vs CPUC Governor Davis attempt to delay the filed rate doctrine case will not succeed The case will come before the judge on Monday February th The federal judge is expected to rule a summary judgment in favor of the utilities However the judge will not allow the utilities to collect the injunction release they are requesting kwh This will be left to an appellate court The decision not to allow the utilities to collect this cash could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing by the smaller IPPs as noted in our reports last week or by larger outofstate generators such as Duke Reliant and Dynegy as noted in the press this morning This is expected next week or the week after Prospects for a Bailout Bill AB X is effectively dead from lack of support Senator Burton despite his public refusals is moving closer to agreeing to a utility bailout The statements by Burton and the CA State Treasurer are merely a negotiating position They are more concerned about the possibility of a bankruptcy than they appear For Burton this is because of his long association with labor unions the unions oppose the utility bankruptcy Burton has been negotiating with consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield so as not to get attacked by him The deal Burton is expected to arrange would be for Bonds to be issued by the utilities rather than the state but with some kind of state support but less than full faith and credit of the state of CA which would not pass This would amount to the securitization of an extra charge on power bills eg though the actual amount is not known These bonds would be assetbacked securities with payment receivable from rate payers The term of these bonds is unknown if the term is made quite long eg years the associated rate increase could be very small The state would purchase the utilities transmission assets for a very high price The amount of the extra charge on power bills will not be known until the price of the transmission assets is settled If the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today which it is believed will happen and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing or even the threat of one sources believe that this bailout plan will be enacted quickly As noted in an earlier report the California legislature habitually does not act until things hit the wall It is expected that the Republicans in the legislature will follow Burtons lead and support the bailout plan The Assembly members in particular are not yet supportive of a plan of this nature One moderate democratic legislator with whom our source spoke said that the opposition to a bailout in her Central Valley district is to However an involuntary filing or the threat thereof may be enough to trigger legislative support It would allow the argument of an imminent threat to the people of the state of California Consumer Opposition Harvey Rosenfield is too short on cash to fight this plan and the associated rate increase with anything but a referendum If the referendum fails he intends to attack individual legislators though not John Burton who reportedly has immunity from Rosenfield Some legislators are thinking of voting for the bailout plan then supporting a referendum from Rosenfield later However if the bailout plan and rate increase described above is passed through the legislature as a bill rather than put in place by the PUC for example it cannot be reversed by a referendum As additional insurance against Rosenfield by supporting the bonds issued under the plan the state can argue that its credit would be impaired in the case of a referendum to repeal the plan While it is not clear that this is a factual argument it still might impede any referendum

<32983389.1075857668849.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,johnston@enron.com,2001-05-25 09:52:07,California Cc Summary Legislators in both parties are scared about a fiscal meltdown and looking for a realistic Plan B The Keeley plan is the most likely vehicle and would include the generator haircuts and revenue bonds backed by a dedicated rate component Despite uncertainty over dealing with transmission lines and continued oppostion from Burton and his consumer group allies the Keeley plan will probably pass the legislature The generators will not support the plan until they get clearer guarantees from the state that investigations and lawsuits will end PGE could get the same offer as SoCal through the bankruptcy court Budget Binge Could Scare Legislators into a Deal According to sources the Assembly is terrified of the current holes in the budget due to buying power The impact of the energy crisis is reportedly causing panic among some legislators This panic appears to be moving a SoCal bailout plan forward Sources report that a modified Plan B deal is not that far off it will likely take one to two weeks more likely closer to two to move a deal through the Assembly and the Senate and to the governors desk once it is introduced What Would the New Plan B Look Like This modified Plan B deal which will originate in the Assembly will almost certainly include a dedicated rate component to pay SoCals undercollect Revenue bonds will be issued securitized by this dedicated rate component It is also very likely that the generators would be offered cents on the dollar for what they are owed immediately with the possibility of more if they win litigation Sources report that the state is fairly confident that at least most generators would not be successful in winning this additional money Assembly Speaker Keeley reportedly remains the driving force behind this plan and it is being drawn up from within his office Transmission Lines It remains unclear at this time whether a transmission line purchase or option to purchase will be put into the deal since this is a major point of contention between the Democrats and Republicans According to sources the Assembly is working on this Plan Looks Good to Pass Both Assembly and Senate According to sources the vote count for passing a deal containing the above components except the transmission line purchase which is not yet settled looks very good The vote in the Senate would be very close Senator Burton still opposes a bailout deal but he reportedly might not stand in the way of others from voting for the plan making its passage more likely Even opponents of the plan including Burton and the consumer advocates say that the odds of a modified Plan B passing the Senate are better than These opponents are reportedly pessimistic about their chances of stopping a Plan B from passing at this point Caveat Generators Are Waiting For Guarantees That the Witch Hunt Will End As reported previously sources continue to believe that generators would be reluctant to take a centonthedollar haircut without the state offering them relief from further prosecution Without this relief the state could give them cents then try to take away even more Sources report that even opponents of the plan accept that the generators should be offered this relief from prosecution Thus it appears likely at this time that most generators would accept a percent haircut if they were paid immediately Also sources believe that the securitization on the dedicated rate component offered in the modified Plan B would be sufficient to pay back those generators who successfully litigated to win more than cents on the dollar Sources believe that SoCal Edisons creditors are likely to forebear from filing an involuntary bankruptcy long enough for this plan to go through since it would pay back most of what they are owed PG E Could Also Be Dealt In If this plan succeeds it will almost certainly be taken to the bankruptcy court and offered to PGE as part of a reorganization plan This plan can be offered at any time within PGEs period of exclusivity This is a day period though it is often extended following the filing of a bankruptcy petition However sources report that the state is concerned about how to approach the bankruptcy court Based on Supreme Court precedent which legal sources within the state have been reviewing the state would likely lose its sovereign immunity if it entered as a party into the bankrutpcy court This is a problem because the stakes in this case are so high Bailout Bill Would Require Follow Legislation For A New Rate Structure Even if the state passes and signs a SoCal bailout it would still need to pass a rate structure that would allow SoCal and PGE to flow through cost increases to prevent them from once again facing bankrtupcy Therefore this plan does not make the crisis go away
