announced today that a Santa Fe NMbased scientific consulting firm the La Mancha Company has completed an initial study commissioned by TSYI about the Companys patented Pneumatic Accelerator technology The title of the report is Dry Bulk Materials Handling Technology With Emphasis On Coal The reports conclusions are positive concerning TSYI technologys technical and economic feasibility In part because TSYI is still a developmentstage company La Manchas report cites certain caveats including that these general conclusions must be adequately measured and documented in rigorous pilottest environments such as those proposed by TSYI The Summary Statement of the La Mancha Report says In conclusion the process and its potential application to utilization in coalfired power generation the recovery of usable coal fines from longaccumulating waste sites and its environmentally friendly attributes constitute an intriguing and innovative approach to assisting in reconciling the current dichotomy of energy demand and environmental concern The proposed Phase I Program of Terra Systems should be supported as a first step Commenting on this study Clayton Timothy Chairman of TSYI said We are very pleased with the positive conclusions about our technology that this report has reached The La Mancha Company is a prestigious scientific consulting firm and in this case two of the authors of the report hold PhDs in relevant physical sciences and are also retirees from the Los Alamos National Laboratory We recognize the challenges TSYI faces in achieving successful commercialization including those mentioned in this report But we also feel this study provides substantial professional support for the faith we have in the scientific and economic efficacy of the Companys unique process for dry bulk materials handling Terra Systems Inc was incorporated in Utah in and is presently a developmentstage company It is primarily engaged in the development and commercialization of its patented Pneumatic Accelerator This device is a gas linear particle accelerator which conveys and processes bulk materials at high velocity in a particleisolated state using air as the medium of movement This technology operates efficiently at ambient temperatures and at low pressures and does not use water the generally more costly traditional alternative for processing bulk materials Virtually all organic and inorganic bulk materials used in basic industries can be more economically separated and classified by our dryprocess technology This capability facilitates a number of associated procedures including drying micro pulverizing mixing forming conveying and loading In addition bulk materials can be beneficiated in important ways including moisture reduction ash reduction Btu enhancement and electrocustomization Our system can perform multiple tasks needs less maintenance requires no chemical additives and can improve the surrounding environmental quality Opportunities are seen for many applications in an array of large industries including power generation agriculture mining environment construction ceramics and materials transportation We estimate that our technology could generate economic returns to industrial users in the form of revenues andor cost savings in the area of billion within a few years if adopted for implementation in several large projects Terra Systems anticipates it will share in these economic returns through fees royalties and profit sharing from licensing of its technology TSYI has approximately million shares
