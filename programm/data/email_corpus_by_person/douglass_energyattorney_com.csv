IMPORTANT Attached is a ruling issued yesterday by Commissioner Wood directing th at ESPs and customers file copies of direct access contracts with the Commi ssion by December The contracts will be available to ALL other parties who sign a suitable protective order The Ordering Paragraphs read as fo llow By December any party who believes that it has a direct access contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend d irect access as of July or a date earlier than September shall submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or agr eements along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order A fail ure to submit this information for the Commissions consideration will be c onsidered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the contrac ts and agreements Initially the true and correct copy of each of the act ual contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the Commissions Docket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge ALJ Robert Barnett Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who ha ve executed direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed pro tective order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff which shall be submitted to ALJ Barnett by December The electric service providers and customers who are parties sha ll work with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective o rder and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commiss ion staff by December Parties supplemental comments to the comments they filed in res ponse to the October rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted b y January As a preliminary matter of course AReM and WPTF do not in their own names have direct access contracts However certain members of AReM and WPTF are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course they wish to take The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight this Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds I will be considering our options and get back to you with more detail However as a very preli minary analysis it is evident that the Commission does not have jurisdicti on over either ESPs or the customers they serve The request is also parti cularly outrageous because of the statements that A failure to submit thi s information for the Commissions consideration will be considered a waive r of the arguments related to the claims involving the contracts and agreem ents and Parties to this proceeding may have access to these contracts an d agreements after the appropriate protective order and nondisclosure agree ments are in effect The former is a likely denial of due process and the latter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing information to ESP compet itors and exposes sensitive pricing information to competitors of energyde pendent customers Your thoughts would be appreciated My initial reaction is that this is time for ESPs and customer groups such as CMTA ABAG CLECA CIU EPUC SPURR etc to band together and fight this at multiple levels from the Governors Office on down including in the media Your thoughts would be
