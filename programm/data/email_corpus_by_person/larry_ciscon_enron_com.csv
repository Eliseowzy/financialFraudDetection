<3518930.1075852683377.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,larry.ciscon@enron.com,2001-07-12 08:43:14,Leadership of the Xcelerator John Echols Cc Mr Skilling Thank you for inviting me to participate in the last Executive Forum It was very informative And it helped me to understand some of the corporate goals and issues more clearly As I mentioned in that meeting I think the Xcelerator can be a key tool for leveraging our soft assets as well as helping Enron develop new business models to lead it into the future I also think the Xcelerator can play a key role in creating a balance between technology and commercial realities To succeed in these goals its obvious that the Xcelerator needs a very dynamic strong leadership I understand that a new COO has been hired and starts next week I think that this is a great way to introduce a good process structure to the Xcelerator quickly I also understand that youre looking for a CEO from within Enron I just learned this morning that John Echols is moving out of EBS I believe that John would be a fantastic person to lead the Xcelerator John is an extremely bright and creative person who first visualizes the overall business model and then works dilligently to achieve it John is well respected within Enron and is viewed by everyone as a neutral He would give the Xcelerator the internal credibility it needs to succeed Im excited about the opportunity of working with the Xcelerator regardless of who becomes the CEO I think it will become a great asset to Enron Thanks again for your time larry Lawrence A Ciscon Enron Broadband Services Inc VP Software Architecture Smith Street Phone Mail Stop Houston TX
