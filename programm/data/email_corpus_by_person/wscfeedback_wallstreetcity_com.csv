cgoXTROWSCExtroTAsDSDDXWSC Wall Street Citys Stock Search of the Week Searching for January Effect Hopefuls The January Effect is an oftdiscussed phenomenon that occurs when stocks that have sold off near the end of one calendar year outperform the broader markets at the beginning of the following year Typically these stocks decline late in the calendar year due to tax selling but are repurchased after the wash sale period expires Candidates for an early calendar year rebound are often those stocks with favorable fundamental characteristics January Effect Hopefuls is a search strategy that screens for such candidates Primary criteria include a negative week return and a market capitalization of between million The January Effect tends to occur more often with small to midcap stocks than it does with largecap stocks Utilizing the current ratio and debttoequity criteria in the restrictive mode screens for balance sheet strength Companies with high current ratios and low debttoequity ratios have lower levels of financial risk The two revenue percentage change criteria screen for companies with acceleration in their quarterly revenue growth rates Positive forecast earnings growth is then sought to improve the chances that the companies will continue their growth trends in the future As a final criterion positive earnings surprises are sought for the past four reported quarters companies that have a history of exceeding analysts expectations tend to outperform their peers Though the search strategy is designed with the January Effect in mind it works well throughout the year for investors who follow contrarian strategies Investors who are eyeing the results with the January Effect in mind should note that back testing showed material divergences in individual stock returns therefore selecting a basket of securities instead of one or two stocks may reduce risk Click below to see the results TA Search Criteria Using WallStreetCitys ProSearch tool investors can

warning and Bloomberg News Services is reporting that an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is predicting that GSPN will meet revenue forecasts in Though GPSN a developer of DSL integrated

exhibiting shortterm upward trends The largest of these is Tyson Foods TSN which has appreciated by percent since October Three separate trends are aiding the industry First cattle futures hit a year last Monday November because the slowing economy and the sharp drop in business travel has hurt demand Meat processors have responded by slaughtering fewer cattle and feedlot operators have cut back on purchases of young herds Conversely chicken prices rose throughout the summer as supply dropped and demand rose partially because of the increased popularity of buffalo wings Finally a temporary ban on US poultry by Japan and Korea was expected to be lifted late last week after no evidence of avian influenza virus was found on a Connecticut chicken farm according to Bloomberg News Beef and pork futures did begin to rebound late last week on anticipation that Americans would tire of turkey in the weeks following the Thanksgiving holiday thus causing higher demand for steaks and pork chops Broadcasting BRO has been making a sharp resurgence on the Big Chart during the past four weeks with its rank jumping from the th percentile to the th percentile Expectations that the economy will turnaround next year is sparking buying interest in stocks such as Univision UVN Fisher Communications FSCI and Paxson Communications PAX Also aiding these stocks is the travel slump which will result in more people staying home this holiday weekend and therefore watching television On a related note Ackerley Group AK rose after the FCC approved its pending merger with Clear Channel

APR NO Annual Fee online bill pay online account management and fraud protection ApplyNow clkqiaoshuaidajiukuo Wall Street Citys Stock Search of the Week Screening for Potential Downward Reversals Based on the name alone Potential Downward Reversals sounds like a search strategy that is designed for traders who looking for stocks to short While certainly the search strategy works well for purposes of identifying stocks that may be attractive shorts the strategy also benefits investors with long positions by helping them to determine when to start considering taking a profit The reason is that once an upward trend is broken a stock can potentially fall to prior areas of resistance or lower thereby cutting into or completely negating profits Therefore knowing when to sell a stock is as or perhaps even more important than knowing when to buy it The strategy is based around three technical criteria sixweek relative performance oneday relative performance and the oneweek change in the accumulation distribution ratio A minimum gain of percent over the past six weeks is required to screen for stocks that have recently appreciated in price an upward price trend This group is then screened for a oneday decline in price combined with a recent negative change in accumulation distribution ratio The accumulation distribution ratio is a proxy for measuring buying and selling pressure and combining it with a decline price suggests that sentiment may be shifting against a stock It is important to note that this strategy screens for potential reversals and the mere appearance of a stock in the results does not necessarily mean that it is experiencing an actual price reversal Instead the strategy should be used more a starting point for determining when an exit or short strategy should be implemented Investors are encouraged to look additional signs of a trend reversal such as negative breakout in the MACD Wilder RSI or moving average indicators The search strategy is designed to be run on at least a daily basis Investors can click below to see the current results TA Search Criteria By subscribing to Wall Street City investors can utilize Power

FREE report cgoWALLWSCEwallTWsS Wall Street Citys Stock Search of the Week Screening for Stocks That May Top Expectations The primary focus of this earnings season will not be so much on how companies performed during the fourth quarter but rather what their guidance is Valuation levels for many stocks have risen materially over the past few months on the anticipation of an economic rebound occurring this year In order for these valuation levels to be sustained earnings will have to show a dramatic improvement Those companies that issue better than expected earnings results and guidance may be the ones to receive the most favorable attention from investors over the coming the months Stocks With Rising Earnings Estimates That May Top Expectations identifies such companies The search strategy is built around two key criteria a streak of at least four consecutive quarters of positive earnings surprises and a recent upward revision in the earnings forecast for the current year The first criterion establishes that a precedent exists for the company to top expectations while the second criterion suggests that business conditions have continued to improve Combining these two criteria results a list of companies that are continuing to thrive in the current climate and have a track record of beating analyst estimates Using the two criteria by themselves would result in a limited list of stocks but to improve the validity of the search we added four additional criteria Earnings estimates from a minimum of four analysts were required to limit the skewing effects of one overly bullish analyst on the earnings forecast for the current year Four quarters of revenue growth was required limit the results to only those companies that increasing the topline and not just relying on costcutting measures to improve profits Similarly requiring a sequential positive change in revenue between the previous two quarters suggests that the sales growth curve has not been reversed by the recession Threeweek relative performance of no less than percent was required to eliminate those companies may have dropped precipitously over the past few weeks precipitous drops

be notified about new investment tools features and moneysaving opportunities from WallStreetCity and our strategic partners We think youll be interested in this exciting offer from Phillips Publishing To unsubscribe see the link at the end of this email Dear Investor At my Technology Investing advisory we reap HUGE GAINS from the opportunities other investors miss OUR SECRET WEAPON A laserlike focus on AllTech AlltheTime You see most investment advisors pride themselves on a broad reach across dozens of industries They claim that gives you more opportunities to profit But thats JUST BALONEY Theres no way one individual or even a substantial team can spread himself that thin and still do quality researchespecially when it comes to the complex world of high tech Thats why my team and I do ONE THING and one thing only We target the hottest growth markets of technology from microchips to software to biotech And we reap the profits most investors miss DID YOU OWN Immunex for example Im sure by now youve heard of Amgens buyout of this fastgrowing biotech firm When that deal was announced yesterday it included a premium for our Immunex stock But our profits locked in after I advised clients to sell in an urgent email bulletin were much higher than that We banked GAINS in just months time I hope you owned Immunex But if you didnt dont worry about it In just a moment Ill tell you all about my current PICK another overlooked stock that should DOUBLE YOUR MONEY at least in then multiply it times over by BUT FIRST an important lesson to be learned from Immunex Dont believe everything you hear on Wall Street Back when we bought Immunex traders were down on almost everything related to the drug industry And I agreed with them to a point You see the big drug companies are facing intense pressure from generic drugmakers Mercks big disappointment is a perfect example earnings growth next year Thats pitiful in todays drug hungry world But as the baby boomers pass into their golden years drugs are still a HUGE PLAY just not in the traditional way Most big pharma companies like Merck Pfizer and JJ have really slipped when it comes to new drug development But INNOVATIVE biotechs like Immunex are a totally different story Their RD is REDHOT So when Wall Street tarred the traditional firms and biotechs with the same brushwe stepped in to pick Immunex up for a song Eight months later were RICHER Now were about to pull off another profit coup just like it but with MUCH BIGGER potential And this time around YOU have the opportunity to join us Heres the truth about todays socalled communications fiber glut that everyone keeps talking about WHEN the World Trade Center got hit the Internet slowed down very noticeably slowed down In fact it nearly came to a grinding halt That means there isnt nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to accommodate a blip in demand Sources tell me that the government is very worried about this problem After all this is the second time its happened Back in July a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full days That means our communications systems and therefore our economy are very very vulnerable Ten years ago it wouldnt have mattered But today commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those systems Virtually nothing moves without it Thats how banks and brokerages transfer fundshow dispatchers route fleets of truckshow many Americans get paid through direct deposit And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than of Americans even begin to understand Heres one example Qwest one of Americas biggest carriers recently said theyre loaded on their network That doesnt sound too baduntil you understand how these networks operate You cant load a network much past In fact is virtually CATASTROPHIC because the network spends so much time searching for open channels it doesnt spend any time actually sending packets of information The system locks Communications stops The nation comes to a standstill AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed world Internet traffic systems currently run faster in Australia Europe and even South America Thats because we push out more data than everyone else but were not increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate Weve got to catch up and weve got to catch up fast Otherwise business the economy and our national security all go in the CRAPPER BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a fiber glut Because of all the fiber that has ever been laid is dark that is its not activated And the company Im recommending is the supplier of the components needed to do the job Im looking at a DOUBLE possibly a TRIPLE by this time next year And I fully expect to multiply our money fivetimes over by In fact this stock truly has tenbagger potential At the height of the boom this companys stock was nearly times higher So what changed Spending on communications networks dried up Now the government is ready to pump billion in emergency spending into the economy interest rates are practically zero and the need isnt just vital for the economy anymore its a question of NATIONAL SECURITY Please dont miss out Youll kick yourself bigtime if you do Get this companys name and full details in my FREE urgent profit bulletin Tech Stocks Every Investor Must Own Please click here to

is DOUBLING every year now That means a network running at of capacity needs to double its load by this time next year just to keep up Thats why the fiber must be lit Thats why the fiber will be lit
