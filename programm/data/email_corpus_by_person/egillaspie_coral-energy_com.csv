jonathan gillaspie mailto Sent Saturday May AM To Gillaspie Eric Subject Re Trip Details Dan Can you imagine trying to set this up without the internet It would be impossible Anyway heres a quick update from the battlefield In regards to flight plans we had a minor setback today We called our local Wuxi travel agent who is setting up the majority of our airplane tix I asked her if we needed to provide them with full names that are on passports After much heated debate she said no However we then called Shanghai Pudong Airport staff to see what their response was to our enquiry They demanded that all flight tickets show the full names that are on passports Therefore Ill need for you to provide me with the full names first middle last for everybody in your group Well then pass these on to the Wuxi agent who has already lined up the ShanghaiQingdao flight Well also provide the full names to agents wholl be setting up the other flights Secondly let me give you a status report on the Beijing leg of the journey After you sent us your Beijing tour package info we consulted with Lin Qing We then asked our travel agent friend in Qingdao Zang Bao Guo to line us up with his agents in Beijing to get another price quote Jeff felt that the person fee was too much he stated that he had retirement savings to consider ha Weve spent the last couple days in negotiations with another Beijing agent to see if she could provide us with essentially the same Beijing tour package at a more budgetminded price Today she gave us a rough idea on the price of the alternative Beijing tour package The estimated price would be about couple for the same five day package in Beijing This is in comparison to your price quite of person for a five day package We would downgrade from a star hotel to a star hotel its new Keep in mind that were still hammering out the details but the alternative package seems to be the one that would be the easiest on the wallet The crude itinerary would look something like this June fly to Beijing in the morning check into hotel tour the Forbidden City see Chinese style acrobatics show in the evening June Great Wall Ding Temple tombs Beijing roast duck dinner June Temple of Heaven Summer Palace dinner at the Old Beijing Tea House singing and other entertainment provided June Tiananmen Square Beihai Park lunch at Beihai Kings Food Restaurant this place serves meals that the royalty would have eaten during the Qing Dynasty Yong He Gong Tibetan temple free evening June Hutong alley tour lunch at a Xinjiang Chinese Muslim cuisine restaurant Wangfujing Street shopping at the trendy stores Beijing opera in the evening June most folks would fly out of Beijing to USA or Shanghai We knocked out some destinations from the original plan For example the dancing performance and the trip to Liu Li Chang antique shopping Ai Ping called the agent about the dancing show and decided it wouldnt be very interesting it featured some Western dancing styles and the same crap we see on TV every night The dance performance didnt include any minority group dances or traditional village styles so Ai Ping didnt think it sounded very Chinese If the antique shopping is desired its an onthestreet auction with other stores selling original and notsooriginal fake items we can slap it back on the itinerary I dont give a hoot either way I aim to please and we are extremely flexible Ai Pings hometown is six hours west of Beijing Shes been to Beijing a billion times she doesnt care where we go Let me know what you think and well do as instructed Thirdly I dont think well be needing any deposit money The airplane tix will be reserved in your names The Wuxi agent said she would arrange to have your ShanghaiQingdao tix brought to your hotel in Shanghai and that you could pay there The QingdaoBeijing tix can be paid for in Qingdao upon arrival The Beijing agent hasnt mentioned a deposit for the tour package yet If she does Ill put the money down no problem So that leaves you with making the decision on whether or not you want to do the Shanghai tour package your call It looks like a good plan to me If you want any assistance with the Shanghai leg of the journey we can do it Let me know Hope this gives you an idea on where were at Please respond asap with commentsquestions Hope all is swell in Tejas Will write again soon My Regards Jon Gillaspie From Daniel Junk To Jonathan Gillaspie CC Eric Gillaspie Subject Trip Details Date Fri May PDT Jon how is crisis management these days I hope it is coming together for you I hate to bother you but was wondering if Ai Ping has finalized anything with the travel agency or airlines Im sure there are going to be deposits required and such when the reservations are made Just let me know what youre needing from us In the mean time keep cool The suffering will end shortly Take careDan Do You Yahoo Yahoo Auctions buy the things you want at great prices Get Your Private Free

jonathan gillaspie mailto Sent Saturday May AM To Gillaspie Eric Subject Re Trip Details Dan Can you imagine trying to set this up without the internet It would be impossible Anyway heres a quick update from the battlefield In regards to flight plans we had a minor setback today We called our local Wuxi travel agent who is setting up the majority of our airplane tix I asked her if we needed to provide them with full names that are on passports After much heated debate she said no However we then called Shanghai Pudong Airport staff to see what their response was to our enquiry They demanded that all flight tickets show the full names that are on passports Therefore Ill need for you to provide me with the full names first middle last for everybody in your group Well then pass these on to the Wuxi agent who has already lined up the ShanghaiQingdao flight Well also provide the full names to agents wholl be setting up the other flights Secondly let me give you a status report on the Beijing leg of the journey After you sent us your Beijing tour package info we consulted with Lin Qing We then asked our travel agent friend in Qingdao Zang Bao Guo to line us up with his agents in Beijing to get another price quote Jeff felt that the person fee was too much he stated that he had retirement savings to consider ha Weve spent the last couple days in negotiations with another Beijing agent to see if she could provide us with essentially the same Beijing tour package at a more budgetminded price Today she gave us a rough idea on the price of the alternative Beijing tour package The estimated price would be about couple for the same five day package in Beijing This is in comparison to your price quite of person for a five day package We would downgrade from a star hotel to a star hotel its new Keep in mind that were still hammering out the details but the alternative package seems to be the one that would be the easiest on the wallet The crude itinerary would look something like this June fly to Beijing in the morning check into hotel tour the Forbidden City see Chinese style acrobatics show in the evening June Great Wall Ding Temple tombs Beijing roast duck dinner June Temple of Heaven Summer Palace dinner at the Old Beijing Tea House singing and other entertainment provided June Tiananmen Square Beihai Park lunch at Beihai Kings Food Restaurant this place serves meals that the royalty would have eaten during the Qing Dynasty Yong He Gong Tibetan temple free evening June Hutong alley tour lunch at a Xinjiang Chinese Muslim cuisine restaurant Wangfujing Street shopping at the trendy stores Beijing opera in the evening June most folks would fly out of Beijing to USA or Shanghai We knocked out some destinations from the original plan For example the dancing performance and the trip to Liu Li Chang antique shopping Ai Ping called the agent about the dancing show and decided it wouldnt be very interesting it featured some Western dancing styles and the same crap we see on TV every night The dance performance didnt include any minority group dances or traditional village styles so Ai Ping didnt think it sounded very Chinese If the antique shopping is desired its an onthestreet auction with other stores selling original and notsooriginal fake items we can slap it back on the itinerary I dont give a hoot either way I aim to please and we are extremely flexible Ai Pings hometown is six hours west of Beijing Shes been to Beijing a billion times she doesnt care where we go Let me know what you think and well do as instructed Thirdly I dont think well be needing any deposit money The airplane tix will be reserved in your names The Wuxi agent said she would arrange to have your ShanghaiQingdao tix brought to your hotel in Shanghai and that you could pay there The QingdaoBeijing tix can be paid for in Qingdao upon arrival The Beijing agent hasnt mentioned a deposit for the tour package yet If she does Ill put the money down no problem So that leaves you with making the decision on whether or not you want to do the Shanghai tour package your call It looks like a good plan to me If you want any assistance with the Shanghai leg of the journey we can do it Let me know Hope this gives you an idea on where were at Please respond asap with commentsquestions Hope all is swell in Tejas Will write again soon My Regards Jon Gillaspie From Daniel Junk To Jonathan Gillaspie CC Eric Gillaspie Subject Trip Details Date Fri May PDT Jon how is crisis management these days I hope it is coming together for you I hate to bother you but was wondering if Ai Ping has finalized anything with the travel agency or airlines Im sure there are going to be deposits required and such when the reservations are made Just let me know what youre needing from us In the mean time keep cool The suffering will end shortly Take careDan Do You Yahoo Yahoo Auctions buy the things you want at great prices Get Your Private Free
