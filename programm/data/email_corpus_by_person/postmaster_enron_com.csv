OENRONOUNACNRECIPIENTSCNJSTEPENO To Date Tuesday October GMT Subject I hope this answers your questions me Original Message From Jonda Stowell ENRON Sent Tuesday October AM To Stepenovitch Joe Cc Donn Fullenweider Subject RE Stepenovitch Dear Joe In order to prepare your case for trial several things are necessary as follows Depositions must be taken of you and Tonya We must send discovery to Tonya and we must have sufficient time pursuant to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for it to be answered prior to trial The Court will require mediation before we can go to trial The Court will appoint a mental health examiner and possible an attorney ad litem to represent Paytons best interests This is now a case where custody and possession are an issue and these steps MUST be taken before we can proceed to trial Initially after paternity was established and you first visited with Payton your desire was that all possession periods would be worked out by agreement and neither you nor Tonya wanted any more court proceedings However since then Tonya has bucked your every request for visitation and put limitations of one kind or another on it turning the case into a custody case Without discovery to Tonya similar to the discovery we answered for you and Tonyas deposition and a mental health evaluation we are not prepared for trial and the Court would not be ready to hear the case and entertain what was in Paytons best interest Therefore Mr Fullenweider did not opposed Stewart Gagnons motion for continuance and would have in fact have filed one himself in keeping with your best interest and Paytons in mind As I explained we are working on a Request for Temporary Orders which I expect will be set on along with the hearing on mental evaluations At that time I expect the court to set your possession periods with Payton including holidays Until then we must work on scheduling your possession periods by agreement To confirm your November rd visitation period you have chosen to have Payton from noon to pm in Vero Beach on the rd and will forego November th Where will you pick up and drop off Payton Jonda Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday October AM To Subject RE Stepenovitch Good Morning Jonda I received the papers from you yesterday about the continuance I was under the impression that it was the court moving the date It looks like to me its Tonya and her Lawyer They have been doing pushing this case back from the start and Im sure they are doing this for a reason to say to the jury that a bond has been created and its not in the best interest of the child to go with his father after being with his mother for so long At this point if we go to trial Payton will be year old and I will have only seen him about times I dont think I will win that battle As for the November th court date will we have something in writing by the judge so I can start having my rights I feel like her and her lawyer can tell us what to do and we must follow there rules Will this change or do I have to go through this until the April court date That cant be how is system works I should have the right to pick my own son up whenever I want and no court or lawyer or even his mother should have anything to say about that I dont understand why everything is against me Finally for the weekend of Nov st I will take my son for the whole day in Vero on Saturday and forego Sunday Joe Original Message From Jonda Stowell ENRON Sent Friday October PM To Stepenovitch Joe Subject Stepenovitch Dear Joe I just received a phone call from Miryam Mitchell She said if you would like to take Payton to Vero Beach on Saturday November rd you may have him from to if you are willing to forego visitation on Sunday and let Tonya have him all day on Sunday If youd prefer this
