steel lobbyists for the US steel industry used the threat that thousands of retired steelworkers in key states would lose their health insurance if their companies closed The specter of an uprising by steel retirees who substantially outnumber active steelworkers provided a potent political argument for the industrys case that Bush should take drastic action to protect US steel companies from a worldwide glut even at the cost of tarnishing his freetrade image The argument was advanced by two top Republican lobbyists Edward W Gillespie and Vin Weber each of whom has been receiving a month from an industryunion coalition called Stand Up for Steel The coalition scored a smashing victory Tuesday when Bush announced that his administration will file a case with the US International Trade Commission seeking to win authority to set quotas on steel imports And although many factors went into the White Houses decision industry sources and other participants pointed to the concerns raised by Gillespie and Weber as a classic demonstration of how a highly motivated constituency can sway an administration that barely won the electoral college and lost the popular vote From a political perspective this was not a hard case to make to a government as closely divided as this one is said Weber a former congressman in an interview Eighteen steel companies are in one stage or another of bankruptcy All those retirees are facing loss of benefits Only about people now work in US steel facilities but at some of the biggest integrated steel ma kers which are in the worst trouble financially there are about six retirees for every active worker The total number of retirees is slightly more than according to industry officials Adding to the political punch behind the GillespieWeber argument was the fact that many of these retirees live in Rust Belt states that were hotly contested in the last presidential election including Pennsylvania Illinois Ohio and West Virginia The most fiercely contested state of all Florida is among the top eight states in number of retirees A lobbyist who worked against the steel industry Lewis Leibowitz of the law firm Hogan Hartson ruefully gave credit to his opponents political skill Leibowitz represents the Consumer Industry Trade Action Coalition which consists of companies that favor free trade on the grounds that import competition helps keep costs low They did a lot obviously Leibowitz said referring to Gillespie and Weber This is an i ndustry that has something like workers and the market value of all the companies is smaller than that of Amazoncom and theyve turned this town upside down So my hat is off to them The administration took other considerations into account to be sure including the need to win support from steel state Democrats for congressional authority to negotiate new trade agreements Jim Dyke a spokesman for Commerce Secretary Donald L Evans asserted that his boss was particularly moved by the pleas of union leaders who recalled how their companies had shed workers and restructured in the s only to find themselves devastated anew by imports Foreign steel shipments which account for about percent of the US market reached record levels after financial crises in Asia Russia and Brazil in the late s Factories are closing and people are losing their jobs because theres not a level playing field Dyke said repeating the administrations argument t hat a major reason for the oversupply of steel on world markets is the subsidies that many foreign countries provided when they established their national industries This fits in with the presidents freetrade strategy Capitalizing on the administrations decision Evans joined in a news conferencerally yesterday with such top labor leaders as John Sweeney president of the AFLCIO and Leo Gerard president of the United Steelworkers of America both of whom backed Democrat Al Gore in the presidential race You can trust that we will be with you every step of the way until the problem is fixed Evans told the cheering crowd which was reminded by other speakers that the Clinton administration had balked at filing a case like the one Bush intends to bring before the International Trade Commission The Clinton administration along with a number of industry lawyers feared losing the case at the time but industry experts said another factor was the staunch fr ee trade stance of the Treasury Department The Bush administration itself has balked at taking action that would directly protect the benefits of steel retirees The steelworkers union has called for the government to create a fund that would help cover these legacy costs but administration officials said their moves to block imports should help protect benefits by aiding the industrys revival The White House will now have to contend with the ire of US trading partners which have reacted with a mixture of indignation and restraint Long Tong Yu Chinas top trade official told a news conference at a trade meeting in Zhouzhuang yesterday that although China is concerned with any protectionist practices or measures it would wait to see whether the US
