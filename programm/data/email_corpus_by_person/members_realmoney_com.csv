finally be the trigger for the market to take off Will the hundreds of technology stocks that crashed and burned in EVER make a comeback Is the Bush Administration goodor badfor the stock market These are the crucial questions facing all investors today Problem isnobodys got ANY concrete answers As a result the market continues to flounder in nomans land up one day and down the next And investors shaken from last year and afraid of what could lie ahead have adopted that classic wait and see attitude And THATS what gives us the FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY we have today My name is Michael Murphy and Ive been analyzing and investing in technology stocks for over years This is what I want to tell you today While everyone else sits on the sidelines smart investors who knowand act onthe five things you CAN count on in have an unprecedented opportunity to profitbig time Let me show you what these five critical pieces of information are Biotech is the Next Big Thing in technology and anyone who plans on being in the stock market for more than minutes MUST own a piece of it today Last year alone the AMEX Biotech index was up a whopping and my Technology Investing clients made over returns with select biotech stocks But mark my words now that Celera published the entire human genome sequence in Science magazine this past February the stocks will soar to previously unimagined heights Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has proven that he will do EVERYTHING in his power to avoid recession in Since January alone he has made four separate significant interest rate cuts and its painfully obvious Greenspan doesnt want to be blamed for sending the economy into a tailspin The big technology companies will bounce back FIRST After a year like investors are in no mood to make bets on small unproven stocks They still want to profit from the fastestgrowing industries but they want to do it more safely by buying the big profitable companies The proof is in the pudding in January alone my Technology Investing readers raked in on the dominant industry leaders we loaded up onat huge discountsat last years end Technology will continue to grow at four to five times the rate of the Old Economy even this year Despite what youre hearing in the media market researchers are projecting PC sales growth of at least semiconductor revenues up cell phone sales jumping and a leap in most enduser consumer products of Theres a monstrous BUYING PANIC coming It will either make you rich or bury you alive Once investors realize where technology is really headed in and beyond theres going to be a MAD DASH to pile back into the stocks as quickly as possible Most investors will be too late and theyll wind up kicking themselves once again as they miss most of the NEXT BIG RUN UP Dont let that happen to you Weve been through this beforein and most recently in Last time my readers and I loaded up on a handful of the worlds most dominant technology companies at crazycheap prices and we made a killing Twelve short months later we were up an astounding I never thought it possible but we now have an amazing opportunity to do it all over again Please I implore you make the most of it To
