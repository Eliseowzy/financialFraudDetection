regarding prioritization CSC handles multiple often independent requests from ENA as well as EES many of which are of the we need this as soon as possible variety What they want from us not just EES but Enron as a whole is a prioritization of all of these outstanding requests not just what our group might have asked of them Sorry about the confusion John Forwarded by John RutledgeHOUEES on AM Embedded Enron Energy Services image moved to file From John Rutledge picpcx AM To Chris nronXgate Michael ES cc Richard ES Maurice ES Kenny ES Steven ES Subject WIP for MV data Steve Heres a quick synopsis of what we need Users want actual historical metered data If they cant get the data before it has been EEVd by MV they need to know for each value whether it is the actual metered amount or an estimated value Users understand that there may be missing data but do not require the metadata detailing this However this is with the understanding that the backfill data will eventually arrive at some later date We want any account and meterdescriptive data as well as the associated volumetric data A test file to see what kind of data are available and a few consecutive days worth of data to get a feel for volumes are needed If data is received from am how soon after am can we get a file Please do not burn in this process just yet because data and timing requirements may change Chris With the bullets above Steve has promised to turn around the completed WIP by COB today or tomorrow morning Hopefully this will at least get the ball rolling It is then up to the business to determine whether to proceed and how to prioritze it There must be concerted effort from the business to prioritize requests to CSC Steve gave me Richard Millers name as the EES coordinator for these requests Please contact him and let me know what you find out Going forward we MUST establish who is responsible for filling these things out and keeping track of them Ive heard different things from different people and I dont want to end up nor should anyone else being the person who fields random and anonymous lobs from the other side of the fence Cheers John See attached file picpcx picpcx picpcx
