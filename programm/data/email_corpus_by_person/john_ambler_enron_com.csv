fails to pay Enron S Balakrishnan The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI Financial institutions in the US have presse d the panic button with Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB defaulting on payments for electricity it has purchased from the Enron subsidiary Dabhol Power Corporation DPC The board owes DPC Rs crores of which Enron expected Rs crores would be paid by January The board has thrown its hands up in the air saying that it is simpl y in no position to effect the payment The situation has been vastly complicated with chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh plainly refusing to bail out MSEB It is learnt that major lending institutions have convened a meeting in New York on January to decide a course of action to compel MSEB to coug h up the money Indian lead financial institutionsincluding IDBI SBI and ICCI who have a collective exposure of billion have also been asked to send their representatives for the meeting If MSEB does not pay up by then the institutions may decide to invoke the letter of credit The implication is that lending institutions may seize MSEBs accounts with them and adjust the monies against the dues payable to DPC It is learnt that Enron has informed the US embassy of the intransigent attitude adopted by MSEB and the state government Incidentally Enron was a contributor to US presidentelect George W Bushs election campaign Sources close to Enron said the company might be willi ng to restructure the power purchase agreement PPA provided MSEB does not defaul t on its payments But the restructuring of the PPA may not be an easy task since it will require the endorsement by the Central Electricity Authority and the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission The sources said the defaulting by MSEB and the stance adopted by Mr Deshmukh will have serious implications since a large number of worl d financial institutionslike Citibank ABN Amro Bank of America apart from the governments of the US Belgium and Japanhave financial stakes in the MW project T he defaulting will also harm the interests of several Indian financial institutions who have lent money for the controversial venture Enron is hoping that the BJPled government at the Centre may persuade Mr Deshmukh to defuse the crisis But if ultimately no payment is forthcoming Enron may act tough and invoke the guarantee and counter guarantee given to th e project by the state and the central governments respectively The deal with Enron was signed by Sharad Pawar when he was the chief minister in the early nineties It was first scrapped and later enthusiastically endorsed by the Shiv SenaBJP coalition which came into office in It is learnt that Mr Deshmukh has been asked by the Congress high command to adopt a tough stand so as to embarrass Mr Pawarwho is now in the Nationalist Congress Partyt he Sena and the BJP It is learnt that state finance minister Jayant Patil informed Enron representatives that the current situation was the outcome of coalition politic s An Enron official countered this by pointing out that a coalition of lending institutions was involved at the other end of the table Enron ready to renegotiate Dabhol deal Our Corporate Bureau MUMBAI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard US energy major Enron is prepared to renegotiate its deal with the Maharashtra government on the controversial Dabhol Power project but has emphasised that the new deal cannot be a unilateral one This is the first time that Enron has publicly spelt o ut its stand on the issue Enron India managing director K Wade Cline said The deal cannot be a unilateral one MSEB Maharashtra State Electricity Board must continue to pay us for the power purchased We should also be allowed to continue operating our power station at Dabhol Obviously it must be a deal that works The state government Cline said must remember that just as it was important for it to sell a deal to its various constituencies it was important for Enron to be able to sell it to its various stakeholders A renegotiated deal will mean that we will have to convince the gas suppliers to rework the agreement that we have signed with them It also means that we will have to convince our lenders Cline added The billion project has an equity component of billion and a debt component of billion Cline pointed out that the entire equity as well as billion in debt had already been brought in Domestic lenders like ICICI IDBI and SBI have contributed billion The Indian government has a huge exposure to this project through the financial institutions The governments of Japan Belgium and US too have a stake in the project as banks and export credit agencies of these countries ha ve a huge exposure he said The Economic Times Online Printed from wwweconomictimescom home back Dabhol phase II in danger as arbitration looms Bodhisatva Ganguli Girish Kuber MUMBAI THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Boards inability to pay the Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company is rapidly emerging as a threat to the viability of phase II of the Dabhol project The project involves a generating capacity of MW and an LNG terminal of five million tonnes This is because there is an increasing possibility that the dispute over phase I may end up in arbitration courts if the MSEB continues to fail to pay up and the state government refuses to bail out the ailing electricity board As a result lenders may stop disbursing fun ds for phase II Enron Indias managing director K Wade Cline said on Saturday evening t hat international arbitration was a real possibility The PPA allows for arbitration in case a dispute cannot be resolved throug h negotiations Enron officials say they have made no headway so far in talks with the MSEB or t he state government Enron is also considering invoking the letter of credit and the state government guarantee in order to recover its dues We have no alternative since if we dont get paid then our lenders are saying that they wont fund phase II Cline said If the Maharashtra government does not pay then the central governments counterguarantee could be invoked At a meeting on Friday evening the MSEB is reported to have asked the sta te government to provide it a subsidy of Rs crore per month However the Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh is said to have flatly rejected MSEBs request The Maharashtra cabinet is meeting again on Monday evening The cabinet wi ll also discuss the formation of a committee to review the project The lenders to the project are meeting in New York on Tuesday January to take stock of the situation arising out of MSEBs failure to pay part of the bill for Oct ober and the entire bill for November amounting to a total of Rs crore The projects lenders are reported to be extremely concerned about the viability of the second phase of the project in view of MSEBs failure to pay for power bought from the first phase Cline said that of the total second phase project cost of billion on ly about million of debt remained to be disbursed About per of the construction is complete and per cent of the machinery is on site The

of India said quoting unnamed official sources The Economic Times on Sunday said that the lenders to Enrons local unit Dabhol Power Company were meeting on Tuesday in New York to discus s the inability of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB to clear it s dues As a result of MSEBs mounting dues Enron said it wou ld be forced to invoke the LC the newspaper said The report said the MSEB had outstanding dues worth billion rupees million Enrons local unit said on Friday it will lower tariff s from next month in a bid to defuse criticism that it charges higher rates for the electricity it produces in Maharashtra state Last month the Maharashtra government decided to revi ew the rate at which it buys power from Enrons Dabhol Power saying the high cost was threatening its finances Enron is spending about billion to build a facili ty to generate MW of electricity India which needs to generate an additional M W of power within the next decade to meet growing demand is desperate to attract foreig n capital But after nearly a decade of liberalisation Enron is among the few private power companies to begin generating power in India FIs in US press panic button as MSEB fails to pay Enron S Balakrishnan The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI Financial institutions in the US have presse d the panic button with Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB defaulting on payments for electricity it has purchased from the Enron subsidiary Dabhol Power Corporation DPC The board owes DPC Rs crores of which Enron expected Rs crores would be paid by January The board has thrown its hands up in the air saying that it is simpl y in no position to effect the payment The situation has been vastly complicated with chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh plainly refusing to bail out MSEB It is learnt that major lending institutions have convened a meeting in New York on January to decide a course of action to compel MSEB to coug h up the money Indian lead financial institutionsincluding IDBI SBI and ICCI who have a collective exposure of billion have also been asked to send their representatives for the meeting If MSEB does not pay up by then the institutions may decide to invoke the letter of credit The implication is that lending institutions may seize MSEBs accounts with them and adjust the monies against the dues payable to DPC It is learnt that Enron has informed the US embassy of the intransigent attitude adopted by MSEB and the state government Incidentally Enron was a contributor to US presidentelect George W Bushs election campaign Sources close to Enron said the company might be willi ng to restructure the power purchase agreement PPA provided MSEB does not defaul t on its payments But the restructuring of the PPA may not be an easy task since it will require the endorsement by the Central Electricity Authority and the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission The sources said the defaulting by MSEB and the stance adopted by Mr Deshmukh will have serious implications since a large number of worl d financial institutionslike Citibank ABN Amro Bank of America apart from the governments of the US Belgium and Japanhave financial stakes in the MW project T he defaulting will also harm the interests of several Indian financial institutions who have lent money for the controversial venture Enron is hoping that the BJPled government at the Centre may persuade Mr Deshmukh to defuse the crisis But if ultimately no payment is forthcoming Enron may act tough and invoke the guarantee and counter guarantee given to th e project by the state and the central governments respectively The deal with Enron was signed by Sharad Pawar when he was the chief minister in the early nineties It was first scrapped and later enthusiastically endorsed by the Shiv SenaBJP coalition which came into office in It is learnt that Mr Deshmukh has been asked by the Congress high command to adopt a tough stand so as to embarrass Mr Pawarwho is now in the Nationalist Congress Partyt he Sena and the BJP It is learnt that state finance minister Jayant Patil informed Enron representatives that the current situation was the outcome of coalition politic s An Enron official countered this by pointing out that a coalition of lending institutions was involved at the other end of the table Enron ready to renegotiate Dabhol deal Our Corporate Bureau MUMBAI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard US energy major Enron is prepared to renegotiate its deal with the Maharashtra government on the controversial Dabhol Power project but has emphasised that the new deal cannot be a unilateral one This is the first time that Enron has publicly spelt o ut its stand on the issue Enron India managing director K Wade Cline said The deal cannot be a unilateral one MSEB Maharashtra State Electricity Board must continue to pay us for the power purchased We should also be allowed to continue operating our power station at Dabhol Obviously it must be a deal that works The state government Cline said must remember that just as it was important for it to sell a deal to its various constituencies it was important for Enron to be able to sell it to its various stakeholders A renegotiated deal will mean that we will have to convince the gas suppliers to rework the agreement that we have signed with them It also means that we will have to convince our lenders Cline added The billion project has an equity component of billion and a debt component of billion Cline pointed out that the entire equity as well as billion in debt had already been brought in Domestic lenders like ICICI IDBI and SBI have contributed billion The Indian government has a huge exposure to this project through the financial institutions The governments of Japan Belgium and US too have a stake in the project as banks and export credit agencies of these countries ha ve a huge exposure he said The Economic Times Online Printed from wwweconomictimescom home back Dabhol phase II in danger as arbitration looms Bodhisatva Ganguli Girish Kuber MUMBAI THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Boards inability to pay the Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company is rapidly emerging as a threat to the viability of phase II of the Dabhol project The project involves a generating capacity of MW and an LNG terminal of five million tonnes This is because there is an increasing possibility that the dispute over phase I may end up in arbitration courts if the MSEB continues to fail to pay up and the state government refuses to bail out the ailing electricity board As a result lenders may stop disbursing fun ds for phase II Enron Indias managing director K Wade Cline said on Saturday evening t hat international arbitration was a real possibility The PPA allows for arbitration in case a dispute cannot be resolved throug h negotiations Enron officials say they have made no headway so far in talks with the MSEB or t he state government Enron is also considering invoking the letter of credit and the state government guarantee in order to recover its dues We have no alternative since if we dont get paid then our lenders are saying that they wont fund phase II Cline said If the Maharashtra government does not pay then the central governments counterguarantee could be invoked At a meeting on Friday evening the MSEB is reported to have asked the sta te government to provide it a subsidy of Rs crore per month However the Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh is said to have flatly rejected MSEBs request The Maharashtra cabinet is meeting again on Monday evening The cabinet wi ll also discuss the formation of a committee to review the project The lenders to the project are meeting in New York on Tuesday January to take stock of the situation arising out of MSEBs failure to pay part of the bill for Oct ober and the entire bill for November amounting to a total of Rs crore The projects lenders are reported to be extremely concerned about the viability of the second phase of the project in view of MSEBs failure to pay for power bought from the first phase Cline said that of the total second phase project cost of billion on ly about million of debt remained to be disbursed About per of the construction is complete and per cent of the machinery is on site The

your early comments and approval would be appreciated I can be reached at home or cellular this evening There have been a number of press reports today about the payment issue Copies of the stories

international wire services The other two Indian press reports appear to have taken other discussionsbackground briefings and unfairly attributed some quotes to Wade We can expect additional media

John Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited BOMBAY Jan Reuters The Indian government has asked the western state of Maharashtra to work out ways to pay outstanding dues t o US energy giant Enron Corp media reports said on Sunday Enron has threatened to invoke letters of credit LC and the federal governments counter guarantee The state government has to work on the issue the Press Trust of India said quoting unnamed official sources The Economic Times on Sunday said that the lenders to Enrons local unit Dabhol Power Company were meeting on Tuesday in New York to discus s the inability of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB to clear it s dues As a result of MSEBs mounting dues Enron said it wou ld be forced to invoke the LC the newspaper said The report said the MSEB had outstanding dues worth billion rupees million Enrons local unit said on Friday it will lower tariff s from next month in a bid to defuse criticism that it charges higher rates for the electricity it produces in Maharashtra state Last month the Maharashtra government decided to revi ew the rate at which it buys power from Enrons Dabhol Power saying the high cost was threatening its finances Enron is spending about billion to build a facili ty to generate MW of electricity India which needs to generate an additional M W of power within the next decade to meet growing demand is desperate to attract foreig n capital But after nearly a decade of liberalisation Enron is among the few private power companies to begin generating power in India FIs in US press panic button as MSEB fails to pay Enron S Balakrishnan The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI Financial institutions in the US have presse d the panic button with Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB defaulting on payments for electricity it has purchased from the Enron subsidiary Dabhol Power Corporation DPC The board owes DPC Rs crores of which Enron expected Rs crores would be paid by January The board has thrown its hands up in the air saying that it is simpl y in no position to effect the payment The situation has been vastly complicated with chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh plainly refusing to bail out MSEB It is learnt that major lending institutions have convened a meeting in New York on January to decide a course of action to compel MSEB to coug h up the money Indian lead financial institutionsincluding IDBI SBI and ICCI who have a collective exposure of billion have also been asked to send their representatives for the meeting If MSEB does not pay up by then the institutions may decide to invoke the letter of credit The implication is that lending institutions may seize MSEBs accounts with them and adjust the monies against the dues payable to DPC It is learnt that Enron has informed the US embassy of the intransigent attitude adopted by MSEB and the state government Incidentally Enron was a contributor to US presidentelect George W Bushs election campaign Sources close to Enron said the company might be willi ng to restructure the power purchase agreement PPA provided MSEB does not defaul t on its payments But the restructuring of the PPA may not be an easy task since it will require the endorsement by the Central Electricity Authority and the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission The sources said the defaulting by MSEB and the stance adopted by Mr Deshmukh will have serious implications since a large number of worl d financial institutionslike Citibank ABN Amro Bank of America apart from the governments of the US Belgium and Japanhave financial stakes in the MW project T he defaulting will also harm the interests of several Indian financial institutions who have lent money for the controversial venture Enron is hoping that the BJPled government at the Centre may persuade Mr Deshmukh to defuse the crisis But if ultimately no payment is forthcoming Enron may act tough and invoke the guarantee and counter guarantee given to th e project by the state and the central governments respectively The deal with Enron was signed by Sharad Pawar when he was the chief minister in the early nineties It was first scrapped and later enthusiastically endorsed by the Shiv SenaBJP coalition which came into office in It is learnt that Mr Deshmukh has been asked by the Congress high command to adopt a tough stand so as to embarrass Mr Pawarwho is now in the Nationalist Congress Partyt he Sena and the BJP It is learnt that state finance minister Jayant Patil informed Enron representatives that the current situation was the outcome of coalition politic s An Enron official countered this by pointing out that a coalition of lending institutions was involved at the other end of the table Enron ready to renegotiate Dabhol deal Our Corporate Bureau MUMBAI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard US energy major Enron is prepared to renegotiate its deal with the Maharashtra government on the controversial Dabhol Power project but has emphasised that the new deal cannot be a unilateral one This is the first time that Enron has publicly spelt o ut its stand on the issue Enron India managing director K Wade Cline said The deal cannot be a unilateral one MSEB Maharashtra State Electricity Board must continue to pay us for the power purchased We should also be allowed to continue operating our power station at Dabhol Obviously it must be a deal that works The state government Cline said must remember that just as it was important for it to sell a deal to its various constituencies it was important for Enron to be able to sell it to its various stakeholders A renegotiated deal will mean that we will have to convince the gas suppliers to rework the agreement that we have signed with them It also means that we will have to convince our lenders Cline added The billion project has an equity component of billion and a debt component of billion Cline pointed out that the entire equity as well as billion in debt had already been brought in Domestic lenders like ICICI IDBI and SBI have contributed billion The Indian government has a huge exposure to this project through the financial institutions The governments of Japan Belgium and US too have a stake in the project as banks and export credit agencies of these countries ha ve a huge exposure he said The Economic Times Online Printed from wwweconomictimescom home back Dabhol phase II in danger as arbitration looms Bodhisatva Ganguli Girish Kuber MUMBAI THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Boards inability to pay the Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company is rapidly emerging as a threat to the viability of phase II of the Dabhol project The project involves a generating capacity of MW and an LNG terminal of five million tonnes This is because there is an increasing possibility that the dispute over phase I may end up in arbitration courts if the MSEB continues to fail to pay up and the state government refuses to bail out the ailing electricity board As a result lenders may stop disbursing fun ds for phase II Enron Indias managing director K Wade Cline said on Saturday evening t hat international arbitration was a real possibility The PPA allows for arbitration in case a dispute cannot be resolved throug h negotiations Enron officials say they have made no headway so far in talks with the MSEB or t he state government Enron is also considering invoking the letter of credit and the state government guarantee in order to recover its dues We have no alternative since if we dont get paid then our lenders are saying that they wont fund phase II Cline said If the Maharashtra government does not pay then the central governments counterguarantee could be invoked At a meeting on Friday evening the MSEB is reported to have asked the sta te government to provide it a subsidy of Rs crore per month However the Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh is said to have flatly rejected MSEBs request The Maharashtra cabinet is meeting again on Monday evening The cabinet wi ll also discuss the formation of a committee to review the project The lenders to the project are meeting in New York on Tuesday January to take stock of the situation arising out of MSEBs failure to pay part of the bill for Oct ober and the entire bill for November amounting to a total of Rs crore The projects lenders are reported to be extremely concerned about the viability of the second phase of the project in view of MSEBs failure to pay for power bought from the first phase Cline said that of the total second phase project cost of billion on ly about million of debt remained to be disbursed About per of the construction is complete and per cent of the machinery is on site The

a revised statementQAs This statement reflects significant changes from the Enron India team It has been approved by Wade Cline and Sandeep Katwala legal The issue will probably resurface tomorrow so your early comments and approval would be appreciated I can be reached at home or cellular this evening There have been a number of press reports today about the payment issue Copies of the stories follow The Reuters story was previously forwarded by Jim Hughes In addition there have been a number of India press reports including the Times of India story which may be picked up by some international wire services The other two Indian press reports appear to have taken other discussionsbackground briefings and unfairly attributed some quotes to Wade We can expect additional media interest Monday FYI Jim Hughes has indicated that Ken Lay wants to advise the US Ambassado r before drawing the securities so the probable timing for the draw is Monda y night or Tuesday India time John Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited BOMBAY Jan Reuters The Indian government has asked the western state of Maharashtra to work out ways to pay outstanding dues t o US energy giant Enron Corp media reports said on Sunday Enron has threatened to invoke letters of credit LC and the federal governments counter guarantee The state government has to work on the issue the Press Trust of India said quoting unnamed official sources The Economic Times on Sunday said that the lenders to Enrons local unit Dabhol Power Company were meeting on Tuesday in New York to discus s the inability of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB to clear it s dues As a result of MSEBs mounting dues Enron said it wou ld be forced to invoke the LC the newspaper said The report said the MSEB had outstanding dues worth billion rupees million Enrons local unit said on Friday it will lower tariff s from next month in a bid to defuse criticism that it charges higher rates for the electricity it produces in Maharashtra state Last month the Maharashtra government decided to revi ew the rate at which it buys power from Enrons Dabhol Power saying the high cost was threatening its finances Enron is spending about billion to build a facili ty to generate MW of electricity India which needs to generate an additional M W of power within the next decade to meet growing demand is desperate to attract foreig n capital But after nearly a decade of liberalisation Enron is among the few private power companies to begin generating power in India FIs in US press panic button as MSEB fails to pay Enron S Balakrishnan The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI Financial institutions in the US have presse d the panic button with Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB defaulting on payments for electricity it has purchased from the Enron subsidiary Dabhol Power Corporation DPC The board owes DPC Rs crores of which Enron expected Rs crores would be paid by January The board has thrown its hands up in the air saying that it is simpl y in no position to effect the payment The situation has been vastly complicated with chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh plainly refusing to bail out MSEB It is learnt that major lending institutions have convened a meeting in New York on January to decide a course of action to compel MSEB to coug h up the money Indian lead financial institutionsincluding IDBI SBI and ICCI who have a collective exposure of billion have also been asked to send their representatives for the meeting If MSEB does not pay up by then the institutions may decide to invoke the letter of credit The implication is that lending institutions may seize MSEBs accounts with them and adjust the monies against the dues payable to DPC It is learnt that Enron has informed the US embassy of the intransigent attitude adopted by MSEB and the state government Incidentally Enron was a contributor to US presidentelect George W Bushs election campaign Sources close to Enron said the company might be willi ng to restructure the power purchase agreement PPA provided MSEB does not defaul t on its payments But the restructuring of the PPA may not be an easy task since it will require the endorsement by the Central Electricity Authority and the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission The sources said the defaulting by MSEB and the stance adopted by Mr Deshmukh will have serious implications since a large number of worl d financial institutionslike Citibank ABN Amro Bank of America apart from the governments of the US Belgium and Japanhave financial stakes in the MW project T he defaulting will also harm the interests of several Indian financial institutions who have lent money for the controversial venture Enron is hoping that the BJPled government at the Centre may persuade Mr Deshmukh to defuse the crisis But if ultimately no payment is forthcoming Enron may act tough and invoke the guarantee and counter guarantee given to th e project by the state and the central governments respectively The deal with Enron was signed by Sharad Pawar when he was the chief minister in the early nineties It was first scrapped and later enthusiastically endorsed by the Shiv SenaBJP coalition which came into office in It is learnt that Mr Deshmukh has been asked by the Congress high command to adopt a tough stand so as to embarrass Mr Pawarwho is now in the Nationalist Congress Partyt he Sena and the BJP It is learnt that state finance minister Jayant Patil informed Enron representatives that the current situation was the outcome of coalition politic s An Enron official countered this by pointing out that a coalition of lending institutions was involved at the other end of the table Enron ready to renegotiate Dabhol deal Our Corporate Bureau MUMBAI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard US energy major Enron is prepared to renegotiate its deal with the Maharashtra government on the controversial Dabhol Power project but has emphasised that the new deal cannot be a unilateral one This is the first time that Enron has publicly spelt o ut its stand on the issue Enron India managing director K Wade Cline said The deal cannot be a unilateral one MSEB Maharashtra State Electricity Board must continue to pay us for the power purchased We should also be allowed to continue operating our power station at Dabhol Obviously it must be a deal that works The state government Cline said must remember that just as it was important for it to sell a deal to its various constituencies it was important for Enron to be able to sell it to its various stakeholders A renegotiated deal will mean that we will have to convince the gas suppliers to rework the agreement that we have signed with them It also means that we will have to convince our lenders Cline added The billion project has an equity component of billion and a debt component of billion Cline pointed out that the entire equity as well as billion in debt had already been brought in Domestic lenders like ICICI IDBI and SBI have contributed billion The Indian government has a huge exposure to this project through the financial institutions The governments of Japan Belgium and US too have a stake in the project as banks and export credit agencies of these countries ha ve a huge exposure he said The Economic Times Online Printed from wwweconomictimescom home back Dabhol phase II in danger as arbitration looms Bodhisatva Ganguli Girish Kuber MUMBAI THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Boards inability to pay the Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company is rapidly emerging as a threat to the viability of phase II of the Dabhol project The project involves a generating capacity of MW and an LNG terminal of five million tonnes This is because there is an increasing possibility that the dispute over phase I may end up in arbitration courts if the MSEB continues to fail to pay up and the state government refuses to bail out the ailing electricity board As a result lenders may stop disbursing fun ds for phase II Enron Indias managing director K Wade Cline said on Saturday evening t hat international arbitration was a real possibility The PPA allows for arbitration in case a dispute cannot be resolved throug h negotiations Enron officials say they have made no headway so far in talks with the MSEB or t he state government Enron is also considering invoking the letter of credit and the state government guarantee in order to recover its dues We have no alternative since if we dont get paid then our lenders are saying that they wont fund phase II Cline said If the Maharashtra government does not pay then the central governments counterguarantee could be invoked At a meeting on Friday evening the MSEB is reported to have asked the sta te government to provide it a subsidy of Rs crore per month However the Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh is said to have flatly rejected MSEBs request The Maharashtra cabinet is meeting again on Monday evening The cabinet wi ll also discuss the formation of a committee to review the project The lenders to the project are meeting in New York on Tuesday January to take stock of the situation arising out of MSEBs failure to pay part of the bill for Oct ober and the entire bill for November amounting to a total of Rs crore The projects lenders are reported to be extremely concerned about the viability of the second phase of the project in view of MSEBs failure to pay for power bought from the first phase Cline said that of the total second phase project cost of billion on ly about million of debt remained to be disbursed About per of the construction is complete and per cent of the machinery is on site The

John Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited BOMBAY Jan Reuters The Indian government has asked the western state of Maharashtra to work out ways to pay outstanding dues t o US energy giant Enron Corp media reports said on Sunday Enron has threatened to invoke letters of credit LC and the federal governments counter guarantee The state government has to work on the issue the Press Trust of India said quoting unnamed official sources The Economic Times on Sunday said that the lenders to Enrons local unit Dabhol Power Company were meeting on Tuesday in New York to discus s the inability of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB to clear it s dues As a result of MSEBs mounting dues Enron said it wou ld be forced to invoke the LC the newspaper said The report said the MSEB had outstanding dues worth billion rupees million Enrons local unit said on Friday it will lower tariff s from next month in a bid to defuse criticism that it charges higher rates for the electricity it produces in Maharashtra state Last month the Maharashtra government decided to revi ew the rate at which it buys power from Enrons Dabhol Power saying the high cost was threatening its finances Enron is spending about billion to build a facili ty to generate MW of electricity India which needs to generate an additional M W of power within the next decade to meet growing demand is desperate to attract foreig n capital But after nearly a decade of liberalisation Enron is among the few private power companies to begin generating power in India FIs in US press panic button as MSEB fails to pay Enron S Balakrishnan The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI Financial institutions in the US have presse d the panic button with Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB defaulting on payments for electricity it has purchased from the Enron subsidiary Dabhol Power Corporation DPC The board owes DPC Rs crores of which Enron expected Rs crores would be paid by January The board has thrown its hands up in the air saying that it is simpl y in no position to effect the payment The situation has been vastly complicated with chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh plainly refusing to bail out MSEB It is learnt that major lending institutions have convened a meeting in New York on January to decide a course of action to compel MSEB to coug h up the money Indian lead financial institutionsincluding IDBI SBI and ICCI who have a collective exposure of billion have also been asked to send their representatives for the meeting If MSEB does not pay up by then the institutions may decide to invoke the letter of credit The implication is that lending institutions may seize MSEBs accounts with them and adjust the monies against the dues payable to DPC It is learnt that Enron has informed the US embassy of the intransigent attitude adopted by MSEB and the state government Incidentally Enron was a contributor to US presidentelect George W Bushs election campaign Sources close to Enron said the company might be willi ng to restructure the power purchase agreement PPA provided MSEB does not defaul t on its payments But the restructuring of the PPA may not be an easy task since it will require the endorsement by the Central Electricity Authority and the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission The sources said the defaulting by MSEB and the stance adopted by Mr Deshmukh will have serious implications since a large number of worl d financial institutionslike Citibank ABN Amro Bank of America apart from the governments of the US Belgium and Japanhave financial stakes in the MW project T he defaulting will also harm the interests of several Indian financial institutions who have lent money for the controversial venture Enron is hoping that the BJPled government at the Centre may persuade Mr Deshmukh to defuse the crisis But if ultimately no payment is forthcoming Enron may act tough and invoke the guarantee and counter guarantee given to th e project by the state and the central governments respectively The deal with Enron was signed by Sharad Pawar when he was the chief minister in the early nineties It was first scrapped and later enthusiastically endorsed by the Shiv SenaBJP coalition which came into office in It is learnt that Mr Deshmukh has been asked by the Congress high command to adopt a tough stand so as to embarrass Mr Pawarwho is now in the Nationalist Congress Partyt he Sena and the BJP It is learnt that state finance minister Jayant Patil informed Enron representatives that the current situation was the outcome of coalition politic s An Enron official countered this by pointing out that a coalition of lending institutions was involved at the other end of the table Enron ready to renegotiate Dabhol deal Our Corporate Bureau MUMBAI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard US energy major Enron is prepared to renegotiate its deal with the Maharashtra government on the controversial Dabhol Power project but has emphasised that the new deal cannot be a unilateral one This is the first time that Enron has publicly spelt o ut its stand on the issue Enron India managing director K Wade Cline said The deal cannot be a unilateral one MSEB Maharashtra State Electricity Board must continue to pay us for the power purchased We should also be allowed to continue operating our power station at Dabhol Obviously it must be a deal that works The state government Cline said must remember that just as it was important for it to sell a deal to its various constituencies it was important for Enron to be able to sell it to its various stakeholders A renegotiated deal will mean that we will have to convince the gas suppliers to rework the agreement that we have signed with them It also means that we will have to convince our lenders Cline added The billion project has an equity component of billion and a debt component of billion Cline pointed out that the entire equity as well as billion in debt had already been brought in Domestic lenders like ICICI IDBI and SBI have contributed billion The Indian government has a huge exposure to this project through the financial institutions The governments of Japan Belgium and US too have a stake in the project as banks and export credit agencies of these countries ha ve a huge exposure he said The Economic Times Online Printed from wwweconomictimescom home back Dabhol phase II in danger as arbitration looms Bodhisatva Ganguli Girish Kuber MUMBAI THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Boards inability to pay the Enronpromoted Dabhol Power Company is rapidly emerging as a threat to the viability of phase II of the Dabhol project The project involves a generating capacity of MW and an LNG terminal of five million tonnes This is because there is an increasing possibility that the dispute over phase I may end up in arbitration courts if the MSEB continues to fail to pay up and the state government refuses to bail out the ailing electricity board As a result lenders may stop disbursing fun ds for phase II Enron Indias managing director K Wade Cline said on Saturday evening t hat international arbitration was a real possibility The PPA allows for arbitration in case a dispute cannot be resolved throug h negotiations Enron officials say they have made no headway so far in talks with the MSEB or t he state government Enron is also considering invoking the letter of credit and the state government guarantee in order to recover its dues We have no alternative since if we dont get paid then our lenders are saying that they wont fund phase II Cline said If the Maharashtra government does not pay then the central governments counterguarantee could be invoked At a meeting on Friday evening the MSEB is reported to have asked the sta te government to provide it a subsidy of Rs crore per month However the Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh is said to have flatly rejected MSEBs request The Maharashtra cabinet is meeting again on Monday evening The cabinet wi ll also discuss the formation of a committee to review the project The lenders to the project are meeting in New York on Tuesday January to take stock of the situation arising out of MSEBs failure to pay part of the bill for Oct ober and the entire bill for November amounting to a total of Rs crore The projects lenders are reported to be extremely concerned about the viability of the second phase of the project in view of MSEBs failure to pay for power bought from the first phase Cline said that of the total second phase project cost of billion on ly about million of debt remained to be disbursed About per of the construction is complete and per cent of the machinery is on site The
