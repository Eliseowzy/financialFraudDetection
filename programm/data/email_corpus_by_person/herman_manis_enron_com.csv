<28395918.1075845610795.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,herman.manis@enron.com,2000-10-17 06:26:00,Re Ft Pierce HRSG Option Agreement Cc included in the body of the attached Barton CT PM To Herman NRON cc Sheila CT Subject Re Ft Pierce HRSG Option Agreement I agree we need more discussion However re the need to skate around lease issues in whatever docs are created now remember the only document we propose to sign in the near future is the HRSG option and the only payment we propose to make is the option premium to secure the delivery date I dont see the need to worry about the lease issues in the other draft documents we create now to try to gain agreement in principle to the basic commercial terms of the deal The other documents will never be signed without necessary compliant provisions unless we opt to flip the project to a third party concurrently with their execution If we dont opt to flip to a third party we will revise the documents before their execution to address the lease issues By your response are you implying that the simple creation of these other draft documents and our discussion of the commercial terms therein with our counterparty gives rise to onbalance sheet concerns irrespective of what we actually sign Herman NRON PM To Barton CT cc Sheila CT Subject Re Ft Pierce HRSG Option Agreement We need to discuss these issues in more detail tomorrow during the am presentation We need to be careful to skate around lease issues involving in whatever docs are created now because we could end up in a lease model in the future Anything we create now and should have to live with may hurt us in the future if in a lease Barton CT AM To Darrell NRON cc David CT Rusty NRON Mathew CT Sheila CT Herman NRON Subject Re Ft Pierce HRSG Option Agreement The option of equipment is the same method used to secure firm delivery dates in the ABB transformer financing which was ultimately rolled into a West LB structure As I understand it in a context option premium is not a hard cost and hence does not give rise to onbalance sheet concerns so long as total project soft costs of which the premium is a part do not exceed of aggregate project cost Here to keep the deal offbalance sheet we are looking to either i a TECO or other third party investor take out by purchase of the project entity membership interests concurrently with the project entitys execution of definitive project agreements or ii a West LB lease structure Even though we are not drafting the project documents to incorporate a West LB structure at this time we need to maintain flexibility to revise the documents to reflect a West LB structure if a third party deal does not materialize or if we determine a West LB structure would be more beneficial and West LB would agree to the takeoutThe principal constraint imposed by maintaining this flexibility is that all of our expenditures under the HRSG contract until the take out is firmed up must be able to be characterized as option premiumsoft cost and must not when aggregated with other project soft costs exceed of total project costs We have opted not to draft all of the project documents on a West LB model now because it has been determined subsequent to the draft of the HRSG contract on a West LB model that as a practical matter incorporation of this approach into all the project agreements will impede our ability to reach commercial agreement with FPUA If we fail to reach commercial agreement the offbalance sheet concerns are all academic Put another way we think that if we can reach commercial agreement first it will be easier to revise the documents later to incorporate a West LB structure if we decide to go that route because it will be easier for FPUA to conceptualize the changes imposed by our financing requirements after the principal commercial issues are solved The same rationale applies to the HRSG vendor I know this requires a change to the HRSG draft to eliminate the West LB structure currently reflected therein but if we opt for the third party takeout the West LB approach currently reflected in the HRSG contract would have to be deleted anyway I As soon as it is drafted we need to run the HRSG option by Herman Manis to ensure that our approach does not jeopardize our ability to use the West LB alternative later or otherwise have adverse accounting treatment I understand the offbalance sheet treatment is in part a function of our intent at the time we enter into project agreements and to my knowledge the option has never been used where a third party takeout or lease takeout are being considered as alternative offbalance sheet approaches at the time a project document is signed It seems to me however that the bare execution of the HRSG option where the ultimate takeout mechanic is uncertain and no definitive project agreements have been signed does not foreclose our ability to later opt for a West LB takeout or otherwise result in the project having to be taken on balance sheet if a third party takeout does not materialize By copy hereof Im requesting Herman share with us his thoughts on our proposed approach to the Ft Pierce project Darrell NRON AM To Cheryl CostaENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT John G RigbyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Barton CT Subject Ft Pierce HRSG Option Agreement FYI as indicated previously Bart ClarkENA recommends an option approach for purchase of HRSG and has lead in developing agreement Previous ABB option agreement attachedbelow may be used as starting point Bart there is a question as to whether the option approach will satisfy off balance sheet requirements Please advise Forwarded by Darrell StovallNAEnron on AM Barton CT PM To Darrell NRON cc Subject Re equipment option Thanks I will get to the option as soon as I finish a couple of other agreements scheduled to be completed before the Thursday meeting on definitive agreements Ill add a revised option to the list and try to have it done by Thursday to discuss and send to the accountants Darrell NRON PM To Barton CT cc Bruce GoldenENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re equipment option Bart Initial heat balance part of HRSG RFP went out today balance hopefully will go out later this week Reason for target date on draft HRSG option I suggest that we need to provide this to bidders as early as possible in the process to avoid late in the game surprises and potential delays in getting HRSG commitment Lets discuss as appropriate Darrell Barton CT AM To Darrell nron cc Subject equipment option FYI I will see about revising the ABB option for the Fort Pierce deal as soon as I finish some other matters including the Interface EPC for Ft Pierce that are also in line Once revised the option will need to go to accounting for review and approval I understood the draft

In response to the attached string I need to drop this post to you to fill you in on the process weve followed since our discovery of certain possible issues in consulting services agreements I have pending deadlines so please excuse my tendency to hack and ramble when Im in a hurry Im sure you recall that you Rose Sheila and Herman recently signed off on a consulting services agreement for TurboPark compliance I think the companys name was Universal Project Management UPM Rose asked me to scrub down the UPM agreement as a starting place or form for our future consulting services agreement requests nothing set in stone just a good starting place Hessler is the first consulting agreement under this experiment Per Rose and Bart Rose and a project development attorney will review all future consulting services agreements prior to execution Due to the pending volume of work Rose does not want to bother either you or Herman needlessly so if the revisions are insignificant Rose will not ask me to send the agreement to accounting and finance for review however significant deviations from the form will have to pass back through the full finance accounting and legal approval process on a case by case basis This process really fell out of four or five of our collective conversations over the last two or three days so any comments suggestions or objections are more than welcome At this point were hoping to decrease the time required to generate a consulting agreement for our developers Hopefully we will enjoy a subsequent decrease in the interruptions email and

<29720464.1075845914086.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,herman.manis@enron.com,2000-10-17 06:26:00,Re Ft Pierce HRSG Option Agreement Cc included in the body of the attached Barton CT PM To Herman NRON cc Sheila CT Subject Re Ft Pierce HRSG Option Agreement I agree we need more discussion However re the need to skate around lease issues in whatever docs are created now remember the only document we propose to sign in the near future is the HRSG option and the only payment we propose to make is the option premium to secure the delivery date I dont see the need to worry about the lease issues in the other draft documents we create now to try to gain agreement in principle to the basic commercial terms of the deal The other documents will never be signed without necessary compliant provisions unless we opt to flip the project to a third party concurrently with their execution If we dont opt to flip to a third party we will revise the documents before their execution to address the lease issues By your response are you implying that the simple creation of these other draft documents and our discussion of the commercial terms therein with our counterparty gives rise to onbalance sheet concerns irrespective of what we actually sign Herman NRON PM To Barton CT cc Sheila CT Subject Re Ft Pierce HRSG Option Agreement We need to discuss these issues in more detail tomorrow during the am presentation We need to be careful to skate around lease issues involving in whatever docs are created now because we could end up in a lease model in the future Anything we create now and should have to live with may hurt us in the future if in a lease Barton CT AM To Darrell NRON cc David CT Rusty NRON Mathew CT Sheila CT Herman NRON Subject Re Ft Pierce HRSG Option Agreement The option of equipment is the same method used to secure firm delivery dates in the ABB transformer financing which was ultimately rolled into a West LB structure As I understand it in a context option premium is not a hard cost and hence does not give rise to onbalance sheet concerns so long as total project soft costs of which the premium is a part do not exceed of aggregate project cost Here to keep the deal offbalance sheet we are looking to either i a TECO or other third party investor take out by purchase of the project entity membership interests concurrently with the project entitys execution of definitive project agreements or ii a West LB lease structure Even though we are not drafting the project documents to incorporate a West LB structure at this time we need to maintain flexibility to revise the documents to reflect a West LB structure if a third party deal does not materialize or if we determine a West LB structure would be more beneficial and West LB would agree to the takeoutThe principal constraint imposed by maintaining this flexibility is that all of our expenditures under the HRSG contract until the take out is firmed up must be able to be characterized as option premiumsoft cost and must not when aggregated with other project soft costs exceed of total project costs We have opted not to draft all of the project documents on a West LB model now because it has been determined subsequent to the draft of the HRSG contract on a West LB model that as a practical matter incorporation of this approach into all the project agreements will impede our ability to reach commercial agreement with FPUA If we fail to reach commercial agreement the offbalance sheet concerns are all academic Put another way we think that if we can reach commercial agreement first it will be easier to revise the documents later to incorporate a West LB structure if we decide to go that route because it will be easier for FPUA to conceptualize the changes imposed by our financing requirements after the principal commercial issues are solved The same rationale applies to the HRSG vendor I know this requires a change to the HRSG draft to eliminate the West LB structure currently reflected therein but if we opt for the third party takeout the West LB approach currently reflected in the HRSG contract would have to be deleted anyway I As soon as it is drafted we need to run the HRSG option by Herman Manis to ensure that our approach does not jeopardize our ability to use the West LB alternative later or otherwise have adverse accounting treatment I understand the offbalance sheet treatment is in part a function of our intent at the time we enter into project agreements and to my knowledge the option has never been used where a third party takeout or lease takeout are being considered as alternative offbalance sheet approaches at the time a project document is signed It seems to me however that the bare execution of the HRSG option where the ultimate takeout mechanic is uncertain and no definitive project agreements have been signed does not foreclose our ability to later opt for a West LB takeout or otherwise result in the project having to be taken on balance sheet if a third party takeout does not materialize By copy hereof Im requesting Herman share with us his thoughts on our proposed approach to the Ft Pierce project Darrell NRON AM To Cheryl CostaENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT John G RigbyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Barton CT Subject Ft Pierce HRSG Option Agreement FYI as indicated previously Bart ClarkENA recommends an option approach for purchase
