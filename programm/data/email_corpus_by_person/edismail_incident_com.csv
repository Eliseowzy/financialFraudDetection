<4991838.1075841534623.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,edismail@incident.com,2001-05-09 16:28:19,EDIS STATE EMERGENCY AGENCY DEDICATES NEW HEADQUARTERS News StatewidePST From Governors Office of Emergency Services RANCHO CORDOVA For more than years Californias emergency response to earthquakes floods wildfires and other statewide disasters has been managed from a building that is itself vulnerable to disaster That is about to change Construction is nearly complete on a stateoftheart headquarters and State Operation Center building near Sacramento Today the Governors Office of Emergency Services will hold a dedication ceremony at am to dedicate the building It is named for former state Senator William P Campbell who throughout his year legislative career strongly supported emergency management and public safety The event will also include speeches by OES Director Dallas Jones Sacramento County Supervisors Don Nottoli and Rodger Niello as well as three of the eight past OES directors who served the agency between and Other honored guests in attendance include legislators The event will be topped off by a procession of helicopters and fixedwing airplanes which are being provided by multiple state agencies which OES often calls upon in coordinating disaster response They include the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection California Department of Justice US Coast Guard California Department of Justice California Highway Patrol Sacramento County Sheriffs Department Sacramento Police Department and the California National Guard OES coordinates statelevel emergency preparedness response recovery and mitigation for a wide range of natural and humancaused emergencies and disasters The agency maintains the states hour Warning Center which stands at the ready to provide immediate support for local responders OES also works handinhand with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help California recover from major disasters The desperately needed office space will allow the agency to combine its headquarters operation from seven Sacramentoarea buildings into one All OES headquarters employees will be able to work together under one roof for the first time in more than a decade The existing headquarters site now holds less than half of the agencys headquarters employees The new hightech facility will replace the earlys cinderblock headquarters in South Sacramento It will also enable the agency to comply with more recent stricter construction requirements mandated of essential services facilities as defined in the Essential Services Building Seismic Safety Act The act applies to the State Operations Center The agencys headquarters will for the first time be located outside of a flood plain Though no floodwater has dampened its floors floods have closed roads leading to the headquarters and caused OES staff to prepare for evacuation several times during severe winter weather although it was never necessary to actually evacuate Not only will the new building unite OES sections and branches into one central location and increase flood safety it will provide emergency workers with a more sophisticated telecommunications system No longer limited by the former buildings outdated electrical wiring OES technology and telecommunications specialists have arranged for the new building to feature its own onsite telephone service The service will be used to maintain communications within the building if lines to telephone company switches were ever severed Calls to outside emergency agencies would still be possible through the new system which is capable of satellitetowire and satellitetoradio transmission Further the new site features a generator capable of keeping the operation functioning in a power outage and a second generator for use if the first one were to fail Most buildings if they have an emergency generator will keep maybe a fourth of the building running said lead design architect Kris Barkley vice president of Dreyfuss Blackford Architects This system is set up so that you can pretty much operate the entire building and it would be almost the same as if the power werent off at all The building itself is constructed of materials meant to withstand natural disasters far greater than Sacramento has known in recorded history The Senator William P Campbell Emergency Services Building is made up of two parts The west wing holds executive planning and disaster assistance offices among others The east wing is the emergency response nerve center housing the State Operations Center Warning Center Law Enforcement Branch and Fire Rescue Branch The executive office wing is a sleek and transparent twostory structure of steel and glass with flexible openoffice space to house a majority of personnel By contrast the operations wing which houses the State Operations Center has light entering primarily from skylights The visual focus is toward the center rather than to the outside On the second floor offices open to a mezzanine or wraparound balcony which encircles and overlooks the State Operations Center which is on the first floor below The high solid white ceiling has the shape of an inverted triangular prism which reflects and diffuses the suns rays entering from bordering skylights to naturally light the working area For more information contact
