citizens Until this trumped up money laundering scare the consensus in western democracies has been that personal freedom and privacy greatly outweighed prior restrictions aimed at potential criminal abuse This established principle rightly forced police and prosecutors to build each individual case on legally gathered evidence rather than use the dragnet approach But now prosecutors reverse this traditional right to privacy Instead of a presumption of innocence whole classes of people are viewed as potential criminals based solely on wealth and its free use Subject to civil forfeiture the
