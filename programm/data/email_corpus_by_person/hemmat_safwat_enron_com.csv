Please note that you are the first and only person in Enron that will know about the endeavors that this email discusses Background In while I was taking a graduate course in Economics as part of my MBA program I started to think that there exists some similarities between Economics and Thermodynamics In I discussed my initial thoughts with Dr Ibrahim Oweiss professor of Economics at Georgetown University and we agreed to investigate this topic Since that time I worked with Professor Oweiss on and off investigating the subject In the last couple of years w e started to make good progress that was culminated recently by submitting three papers for publication see table below List of Papers Paper TitleAbstractStatus On the Analogies between Economics and Thermodynamics Part I Basics This part identifies certain analogies between Economics and Thermody namics The analogies between Abilities and Energy Utility and Work Capital and Heat Marginal Utility and Pressure Relative Income and Temperature as well as LABOR EFFORT and Entropy are discussed This part concludes that the suggested analogies bring about new appr oaches that will explain some economic complexities by borrowing or building upon some concepts theories and experiences in Thermodynamics Part II Applications This second Part builds upon the basics introduced in Part I where an alogies between Economics and Thermodynamics have been drawn In this Part the application of the analogies is utilized to analyze some of the topics economists deal with This Part presents a fresh approach that holds promising vehicles that can explain some of the paradoxes economists have been facing for years Submitted for publications as a working paper at the Department of Economics at Georgetown University November A New Approach to Production TheoryThis paper introduces a fresh approach to th e Production Theory Unlike the conventional approach of relating production to Capital an d Labor along the line suggested by Cobb Douglas the approach this paper takes is relating the production to utility change which in turn is related to chang es in capital and labor effort This approach affords more generality and helps in the explanation of some paradoxes that the Cobb Douglas theory could not explain Submitted for publications in Economic Theory October The Capital Engine ConceptThis Paper presents a fresh approach that explains several observations in economics The concept is used to discuss some of the trends the economic growth theory exhibits It is also used to explain gains in productivity associated with tech nology improvements The Capital Engine concept presented in this paper could serve as a b asis for new growth theorySubmitted for publications in Economic Theory October A fourth paper entitled Innovation Why is under preparation In this paper we are able to substantiate based on the concept of the Capital Engine that innovation is the most important driver for economic growth Yo u can see why I chose these two words in the title of the paper from my Enron world I have been collaborating with Professor Oweiss on my own time and I am pleased that we managed to get to this point Professor Oweiss and I are no w convinced that we have reached some breakthroughs that could revolutionize the study of Economics We also feel that we can build further on what we reached and even making more valuable contributions I am sure that you will be pleased to learn of the above of course being a n Economist you shall appreciate it even more As I reach this critical stage on our path of this research project I wou ld like to seek Enron support in two areas I Patents Copy Righting I feel that the contributions that are covered in the three papers are original and may warrant patenting copy righting Since I am the primary author of these papers I wanted to have some credit go to Enron II Grant Sponsorship I feel that my endeavors which have been purely on my own personal tim e so far need to be replaced by a more concerted effort now that we have reached a critical mass Towards this end Dr Oweiss and myself are taking step s to get funding from the National Science Foundation for a joint research project that would be carried out through the Georgetown University I do not know of any particular programs within Enron that would affor d me the opportunity to complete a project like the one we are envisaging I feel that such a research program will be very valuable I am furth er convinced that such program will not be only of an academic value but it wi ll have significant impact to the business world I trust that the publicity that Enron being the leading company in innovation would get out of the success that I am hoping for the proposed research project will be many folds the amount of money Enron would contribute to the proposed effort I would be delighted to send you copies of the three papers and or make a brief presentation on the subject I wish to thank you for taking the time to read the above email amid your busy schedule Regards Hemmat Safwat General Manager Development Engineering Enron Middle East I
