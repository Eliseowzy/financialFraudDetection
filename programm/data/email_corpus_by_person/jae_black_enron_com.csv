xmlnamespace prefix D o ns D urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffi ce Day October Afternoon Session Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts

imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position

supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were

centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit

Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the

parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

xmlnamespace prefix D o ns D urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffi ce Day October Afternoon Session Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

Meyn Jim Harvey Claudette Presto Kevin M Jacoby Be n SubjectFW Summary RTO Week Day Planning Expansion FYI TJ and Claudette please forward to your groups Thanks Original Message From Walton Steve SentWednesday October PM RTO Week Day October Transmission Planning Expansion The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

Message From Rodriquez Andy Sent Thursday October PM Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices xmlnamespace prefix D o ns D urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left l ate in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however the commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as o f all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seem ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f orward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover fo rward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was discussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take th e reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was notice able conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two or ganizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

Harvey Claudette Presto Kevin M Jacoby Ben Subject FW RTO weekState Commissioners FYI TJ and Claudette please send to your groups Thanks Original Message From Landwehr Susan M Sent Thursday October PM Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left l ate in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however the commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as o f all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seem ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f orward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover fo rward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was discussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take th e reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was notice able conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two or ganizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and

SentWednesday October PM RTO Week Day October Transmission Planning Expansion The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Harvey Claudette Presto Kevin M Jacoby Ben Subject FW RTO weekState Commissioners FYI TJ and Claudette please send to your groups Thanks Original Message From Landwehr Susan M Sent Thursday October PM Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left l ate in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however the commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as o f all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seem ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f orward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover fo rward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was discussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take th e reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was notice able conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two or ganizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation

Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation

discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP

xmlnamespace prefix D o ns D urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffi ce Day October Afternoon Session Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Harvey Claudette Presto Kevin M Jacoby Ben Subject FW RTO weekState Commissioners FYI TJ and Claudette please send to your groups Thanks Original Message From Landwehr Susan M Sent Thursday October PM Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

From Rodriquez Andy Sent Thursday October PM Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices xmlnamespace prefix D o ns D urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left l ate in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however the commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as o f all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seem ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f orward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover fo rward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was discussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take th e reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was notice able conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two or ganizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left l ate in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however the commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as o f all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seem ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f orward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover fo rward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was discussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take th e reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was notice able conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two or ganizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

Meyn Jim Harvey Claudette Presto Kevin M Jacoby Be n SubjectFW Summary RTO Week Day Planning Expansion FYI TJ and Claudette please forward to your groups Thanks Original Message From Walton Steve SentWednesday October PM RTO Week Day October Transmission Planning Expansion The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

SentWednesday October PM RTO Week Day October Transmission Planning Expansion The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Harvey Claudette Presto Kevin M Jacoby Ben Subject FW RTO weekState Commissioners FYI TJ and Claudette please send to your groups Thanks Original Message From Landwehr Susan M Sent Thursday October PM Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes

panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion

panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization

structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for

comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position

Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and

a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

xmlnamespace prefix D o ns D urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffi ce Day October Afternoon Session Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but

Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest

SentWednesday October PM RTO Week Day October Transmission Planning Expansion The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

SentWednesday October PM RTO Week Day October Transmission Planning Expansion The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management

Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left l ate in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however the commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as o f all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seem ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f orward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover fo rward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was discussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take th e reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was notice able conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two or ganizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that

been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion

panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for

comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position

Harvey Claudette Presto Kevin M Jacoby Ben Subject FW RTO weekState Commissioners FYI TJ and Claudette please send to your groups Thanks Original Message From Landwehr Susan M Sent Thursday October PM Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

SentWednesday October PM RTO Week Day October Transmission Planning Expansion The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left l ate in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however the commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as o f all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seem ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f orward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover fo rward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was discussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take th e reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was notice able conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two or ganizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for

such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position

Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP

Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left l ate in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however the commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as o f all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seem ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f orward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover fo rward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was discussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take th e reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was notice able conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two or ganizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and

xmlnamespace prefix D o ns D urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffi ce Day October Afternoon Session Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left la te in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however t he commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as of all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seeme d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo rward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover for ward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was d iscussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take the reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was noticea ble conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two org anizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp

Davis Mark Dana May Tom Will Lloyd Lindberg Susan Gupta Gautam Misra Narsimha Scheuer Janelle Baughman Edward D Herndon Rogers Cc Nicolay Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah
