Charlotte Day Dorthy Torno Winston Avera Susan AveraRoth Mike Stephens Rhonda Lawrence Rex Carleton Jenny Smith Paula Raeke Subject Violence On Saturday Sept at approximately am I was awaken by the sounds of a car crash As I jumped out of bed and looked out my bedroom window at Hwy I saw nothing and went back to bed and fell asleep At approximately am I was awaken by the sounds of a man outside my bedroom window requesting an ambulance for someone cut up pretty bad As I jumped out of bed and looked out my bathroom window I saw a police officer outside with a flash light I woke Keith up to tell him the police were in our yard Keith dressed and went out the front door The officer told Keith to get back inside because an armed suspect was running around our home Keith came back inside and told me what was going on After checking on Andrew we went into Chasitys vacant bedroom and looked out the window into the backyard Men with flash lights police cars with spot lights were all over our yard Finally the suspect was spotted behind the pecan tree closes to our house The officers drew their guns and ordered the suspect to surrender Since the suspect would not cooperate an officer shouted several times that he was going to shoot This was not something I wanted to witness so I quit looking out the window Keith told me that he surrendered and that they had him in custody An officer starting knocking on our front door As I opened the door I informed the officer that my husband would be right there Keith went outside to talk to the officer I looked out my living room window and saw my driveway full of police cars followed by an ambulance Hwy and Meadow Lane were full of police cars with their spot lights pointed toward our house Keith came inside and informed me that Buccees in Brazoria had been robbed and a young lady had been abducted the ambulance was for her and the suspect didnt have a gun but was carrying a knife Keith informed me that I did hear a crash and that the truck they were in is laying on its passenger side on the other side of our barn The police were outside video taping our front yard treating it as a crime scene Once the police took off with the suspect and the ambulance transported the victim Keith talked me into going outside and looking at the crash By this time a wrecker was at the scene We watched the wrecker driver pull the truck back onto all four tires and haul it away On Sunday morning at approximately am I woke up and started listening for a rerun of the events that took place hours earlier Once I realized that my home was safe I went back to sleep With a troubled mind I realized that I did not know how to deal with violence I called my brotherinlaw Rev Dale Frankum for answers Dale suggested I read the book of Psalm Gladys suggested particularly Chapter After reading Psalm He will cover you with his feathers and under his wings you will find refuge his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart I found peace of mind I now know that He put me back to bed instead of me searching for an answer to the crash that woke me up which put a violent man outside my home And He kept my son in a deep sleep so that Andrew would not witness the horror that was going on right outside his bedroom window At this time all Andrew knows is that someone had a wreck in our front yard I would like to spare him from the rest of the story As our country heals from the events of Sept and as we continue to fear more terrorist attacks I suggest you read the book of Psalm to find peace of mind because He is our

Patrick Cc Carter Tim Ishee Jeff Subject ENFOLIO Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreement with Northern States Power Company Patrick At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the abovereferenced Agreement for Northern States Power Company NSP I apologize for the delay Our comments are as follows Northern States Power Company Agreement Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues We request in Section that the dollar level be applicable to each of our companies We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section be increased to as to each of our companies Confirmations In the second line please change may to shall We need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for regulatory purposes We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed and returned in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section Transactions Netting and Offset We cannot agree to the netting of payments in the normal course of business under these contracts Amounts due to and from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize when NSP acts as the Seller to Enron in a Transaction Accordingly we propose that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement Early Termination I am concerned that the date to be established for termination of Transactions is without definition I would prefer to see the language in subpart i modified to state that the Notifying Party may establish a date which shall be not less than two nor more than ten Business Days following the date of such notice Triggering Event In the th line down I dont understand the inclusion of the phrase or deemed to be repeated Unless I am missing something it doesnt make sense with the rest of the sentence Please delete this phrase in the Agreement and References to Affiliates In numerous places throughout the Agreements and in particular in Sections and reference is made to Affiliates For regulatory reasons we cannot intermingle the account status of our affiliated companies Moreover NSP is not authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated Please delete all references to Affiliates of NSP in the respective Agreement Article Force Majeure The language in this Article is not typical of most Force Majeure provisions which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period The language in your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time only for a duration of up to Days after which time Force Majeure no longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement In other words Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence involving a separate and independent Transaction This is not acceptable We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments Section Notices Prior to the language in the parenthetical please insert provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically Section Transfer We would prefer that this language be revised to the more traditional language requiring the consent rather than approval of the other Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld Please modify this provision accordingly Section Limitation of Remedies We are in general agreement with this provision however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use The gas sold and purchased under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the ordinary use to which it is intended Please modify this Section accordingly Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions The GISB Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a day confirm deadline rather than hours as reflected in your definition We request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry standard Definition of Material Adverse Change This definition needs to be expanded beyond a review of the level of each companys credit rating Please replace your definition with the following Material Adverse Change with respect to a Party means i any downgrading of any unsecured longterm senior debt of such Party or any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit support for the obligations of such Party each such entity being a Credit Support Provider for such Party such that such debt is rated below BBB or its equivalent by Standard Poors or below Baa or its equivalent by Moodys Investor Services Inc provided that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have any unsecured longterm senior debt that is rate by either Standard Poors or Moodys Investor Services Inc then a Material Adverse Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more events which in the reasonable judgment of the exposed Party constitutes a material adverse effect on the creditworthiness financial responsibility or ability of such Party or its Credit Support Provider as applicable to perform its obligations in connection herewith Definition of Replacement Price Differential Although we are in general agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential it seems preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable cost of cover should be the difference between the contract price and a or day average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred Please modify your definition accordingly Please make changes to the Northern States Power Company Agreement consistent with our comments as set forth above Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes you may contact me via return email or at the phone number listed below Thank you for your consideration I look forward to working with you to
