last couple of days and I understand that OU has a different recruiting schedule then other schools Enron is on campus for recruiting in the near future a nd I have asked Sally to tag on some interviews for summer interns while on th at trip I believe that she has been able to schedule this so I believe that from an OU perspective it may be a mute point now Doing that should be ab le to maintain the momentum that we have developed at OU and all the work Lexi has done By the way the recruiting trip a couple of weeks ago was very successful If you have any other questions or comments please let me know mike Charlene NRON AM To Sally CT cc Celeste CT Richard NRON Mike CT Subject Re Hiring Practices for Summer Interns Sally Thanks for the email regarding summer interns I apologize that Lexi and Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking I wis h that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin g difficulty I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any member of my staff was not responsive That being said please allow me to explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set it You are absolutely correct It is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge As you are aware over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm Brecker Merryman who has assisted us in a number of different mark et research projects However in my opinion this issue is not one that required much research I have been involved in recruiting in some way shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past years Most major organizations with the exception of the Accounting firm s begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring There are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date particularly in the MBA programs For example Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until January As indicated the firms that generally recrui t in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for spring internships The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns Presentations were made in January February and offers were made in February and March The only school that did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope We did of course recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enrons ability to hire quality s ummer interns This past summer Enron had summer Analysts undergraduate and summer Associates graduate We intentionally limited the number of summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful assignments Approximately of these individuals received permanent offers to join Enron The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire undergraduates for summer positions They generally focus on MBAs particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enrons competitors Because the undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have continued to have a special focus on these individuals ie the reason the re were undergraduates and only MBAs With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about which you raised a concern let me address your concerns In your email y ou indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU You did not howeve r provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU While OU has not gotten back to her following is the information obtained from UT o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson o According to Cindy approximately of companies actively recruiting on campus conduct interviews in the fall for summer internships Cindy attributes this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring or in the case of Andersen Consulting have a tremendous need and conduct all interviews at one time o In conclusion Cindy estimated that of companies actively recruiting on campus recruit in the spring for summer internships We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t he statistics at this time I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such information It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably different than what we were told If you would provide the name of the individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for the discrepancies While I understand your concern with respect to OU they appear to be different than most of the other schools at which we recruit If you belie ve that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are supportive however because Lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently As you are aware in most instances the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early August If you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts I hope this has been helpful I can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager Again I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i f you are

last couple of days and I understand that OU has a different recruiting schedule then other schools Enron is on campus for recruiting in the near future a nd I have asked Sally to tag on some interviews for summer interns while on th at trip I believe that she has been able to schedule this so I believe that from an OU perspective it may be a mute point now Doing that should be ab le to maintain the momentum that we have developed at OU and all the work Lexi has done By the way the recruiting trip a couple of weeks ago was very successful If you have any other questions or comments please let me know mike Charlene NRON AM To Sally CT cc Celeste CT Richard NRON Mike CT Subject Re Hiring Practices for Summer Interns Sally Thanks for the email regarding summer interns I apologize that Lexi and Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking I wis h that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin g difficulty I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any member of my staff was not responsive That being said please allow me to explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set it You are absolutely correct It is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge As you are aware over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm Brecker Merryman who has assisted us in a number of different mark et research projects However in my opinion this issue is not one that required much research I have been involved in recruiting in some way shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past years Most major organizations with the exception of the Accounting firm s begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring There are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date particularly in the MBA programs For example Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until January As indicated the firms that generally recrui t in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for spring internships The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns Presentations were made in January February and offers were made in February and March The only school that did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope We did of course recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enrons ability to hire quality s ummer interns This past summer Enron had summer Analysts undergraduate and summer Associates graduate We intentionally limited the number of summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful assignments Approximately of these individuals received permanent offers to join Enron The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire undergraduates for summer positions They generally focus on MBAs particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enrons competitors Because the undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have continued to have a special focus on these individuals ie the reason the re were undergraduates and only MBAs With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about which you raised a concern let me address your concerns In your email y ou indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU You did not howeve r provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU While OU has not gotten back to her following is the information obtained from UT o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson o According to Cindy approximately of companies actively recruiting on campus conduct interviews in the fall for summer internships Cindy attributes this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring or in the case of Andersen Consulting have a tremendous need and conduct all interviews at one time o In conclusion Cindy estimated that of companies actively recruiting on campus recruit in the spring for summer internships We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t he statistics at this time I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such information It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably different than what we were told If you would provide the name of the individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for the discrepancies While I understand your concern with respect to OU they appear to be different than most of the other schools at which we recruit If you belie ve that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are supportive however because Lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently As you are aware in most instances the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early August If you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts I hope this has been helpful I can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager Again I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i f you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance Charlene

Email Subject LNGs Role in North American Caribbean Gas Supply Mike Understand LNG continues to be an enigma cloaked in a mystery for Enron We are continuing to expand our coverage and knowledge base of this marketplace especially in the Western Hemisphere and would like to meet with you to discuss our observations and learn more about Enrons desires in this arena Also we have a meeting planned in DC in late June entitled LNGs Role in North American Caribbean Gas Supply With the US hunger for gas and El Paso AEC and others announcements of new projects the meeting should be constructive especially with DOE and FERC involvement See summary below Let me know when you might be available to discuss the LNG marketplace Weve just completed a white paper entitled AtlanticBasin LNG A Whirling SupplyDemand Balance You may find our conclusions of interest Best regards Bob Nimocks President Zeus Development Corporation wwwzeusdevelopmentcom Wilcrest Dr Suite Houston TX Direct Main GRDATA email TITLE LNGs Role in North American Caribbean Gas Supply DATELOCATION Washington DC June SUMMARY The winter of confirmed the shift in the United States from a buyers to a sellers market Gas supplies for North America ran short as demand rose from colder weather higher electricity demand and shortages in storage from the previous year More and more supply is shifting from the US Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico has proven disappointing US demand for power generation is expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of siphoning off gas that would have been destined for storage Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the s drilling rigs and experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred The current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near full capacity at just over rigs so the industry is constrained on how quickly it can recover The US has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the s and early s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas in years Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from North Africa Algeria These terminals are capable of supplying up to of total US gas consumption about one trillion cubic feet per year Plans are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of however more are needed Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived to be unsightly or dangerous Now El Paso a company that was burned by Congress in the s by the ruling that takeorpay LNG contracts with Algeria were invalid is challenging conventional wisdom They have announced plans for six new terminals to be built in North America three in the United States and three in Mexico New LNG plants in Venezuela Algeria and Northern Australia might supply these terminals Other companies such as Enron and AEC have announced plans to build terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production IPP plants ranging from to megawatts Moreover LNG facilities on Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via undersea pipeline and cable Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and community concern The June conference entitled LNGs Role in North American Caribbean Gas Supply will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas supply shortages how long they are expected to last and what source of natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand The conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG including the capacities and timing of current terminals the prospects for new mainland and offshore terminals and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the Caribbean including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to the United States

Caribbean Gas Supply Mike Understand LNG continues to be an enigma cloaked in a mystery for Enron We are continuing to expand our coverage and knowledge base of this marketplace especially in the Western Hemisphere and would like to meet with you to discuss our observations and learn more about Enrons desires in this arena Also we have a meeting planned in DC in late June entitled LNGs Role in North American Caribbean Gas Supply With the US hunger for gas and El Paso AEC and others announcements of new projects the meeting should be constructive especially with DOE and FERC involvement See summary below Let me know when you might be available to discuss the LNG marketplace Weve just completed a white paper entitled AtlanticBasin LNG A Whirling SupplyDemand Balance You may find our conclusions of interest Best regards Bob Nimocks President Zeus Development Corporation wwwzeusdevelopmentcom Wilcrest Dr Suite Houston TX Direct Main GRDATA email TITLE LNGs Role in North American Caribbean Gas Supply DATELOCATION Washington DC June SUMMARY The winter of confirmed the shift in the United States from a buyers to a sellers market Gas supplies for North America ran short as demand rose from colder weather higher electricity demand and shortages in storage from the previous year More and more supply is shifting from the US Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico has proven disappointing US demand for power generation is expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of siphoning off gas that would have been destined for storage Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the s drilling rigs and experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred The current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near full capacity at just over rigs so the industry is constrained on how quickly it can recover The US has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the s and early s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas in years Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from North Africa Algeria These terminals are capable of supplying up to of total US gas consumption about one trillion cubic feet per year Plans are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of however more are needed Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived to be unsightly or dangerous Now El Paso a company that was burned by Congress in the s by the ruling that takeorpay LNG contracts with Algeria were invalid is challenging conventional wisdom They have announced plans for six new terminals to be built in North America three in the United States and three in Mexico New LNG plants in Venezuela Algeria and Northern Australia might supply these terminals Other companies such as Enron and AEC have announced plans to build terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production IPP plants ranging from to megawatts Moreover LNG facilities on Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via undersea pipeline and cable Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and community concern The June conference entitled LNGs Role in North American Caribbean Gas Supply will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas supply shortages how long they are expected to last and what source of natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand The conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG including the capacities and timing of current terminals the prospects for new mainland and offshore terminals and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the Caribbean including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to the United States

STIRMAN MEDIATOR CLIFFORD L PARMLEY MD JD OF COUNSEL JOSEPH T KENNEDY ERIC R HIRD KEVIN T SHEA TELEPHONE FAX February Via email Mr Mrs Mike McConnell Belhaven Drive Houston TX RE Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction Co Inc as Seller and Mike and Chris McConnell as Buyer Dear Mike We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract and your letter to us regarding same dated February We want to respond to the questions and issues raised in your letter as well as make some suggestions and comments about the proposed Contract itself First the Contract being used is the standard type of Contract used for the proposed transaction The Contract is promulgated by the Texas Real Estate Commission and is to be used by all licensed Real Estate Brokers and Agents We are interested in knowing however if the Contract was filled out by Mr Larry Williams of Prudential Gary Greene Realtors If so does Mr Williams represent you or Flair Construction Co Inc Please advise us accordingly As we discussed we think it is most important that you have the opportunity to read and review the Construction Agreement that Flair Construction Co Inc intends on using for the construction of your home The fact that Flair is both the Developer as well as the potential Builder raises some issues Usually Builders have agreements with the Developer regarding the purchase of lots and building on same Often lots are reserved to certain Builders and if you purchase those lots you are required to use the designated Builders However often lots are free to be purchased by potential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want We are interested in knowing if the lots you are purchasing are actually reserved to Flair Construction Co Inc or is Flair just requiring you to use them to build your home since they are selling you the lots in question As you point out in your letter if you sign the Contract as it now reads you are captive to the Builder and are not free to negotiate with other Builders It appears to us that you will be one of the first homeowners in this new subdivision We think it is critically important that you get a copy of the Deed Restrictions even before you sign the Contract to make sure that there are restrictions in place regarding the size of homes to be built size of lots etc We want to make sure that your home is not horribly atypical for the neighborhood We do not know if The Lakes of Sterling Gate Estates is in the City of Houston or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction This is something you may want to find out as soon as possible If it is outside the city limits is there already a MUD district in place to provide water and sewer services Since this is a brand new subdivision your concern regarding its future development and tax rate is very legitimate Usually until the subdivision is fairly well built out the Developer controls the Community Association as well as the Architectural Control Committee Therefore if this subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of the Developer We recommend in the strongest terms possible that you talk with recent customers of Flair Construction Co Inc to make sure that they were happy with the construction of their homes as well as warranty work Some Builders are far better than others as it relates to followup warranty work after their customers move into their homes We normally recommend that homeowners do not move into their homes until all punch list items are completed to the satisfaction of the homeowner The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract We will now make more specific comments and suggestions in chronological order regarding the Contract Paragraph PROPERTY As we previously stated we think it is important that you acquire copies of the Restrictive Covenants and Deed Restrictions as soon as possible You will be responsible to pay assessments to the Property Owners Association Since Flair is both the Builder and Developer you may want to ask Mr Kent for an estimate of what your Community Association Fees will be Paragraph EARNEST MONEY We suggest that the earnest money be paid to the Title Company and not to Flair Construction Co Inc Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY The standard printed exception as to discrepancies conflicts shortages in area or boundary lines encroachments or protrusions or overlapping improvements is in your Owners Policy In other words the title policy does not cover these types of discrepancies or conflicts However if a survey is completed and an additional fifteen percent of the policy premium is paid the title company will probably delete this exception This is something you may want to consider However this cost would be yours to incur If however it is subsequently discovered that there are such discrepancies and conflicts or shortages then you will have title insurance coverage accordingly Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY last paragraph Make sure you are provided a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance as soon as possible Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY B It appears to us that the only survey you will be provided with by the Seller is one for the new recorded plat of the subdivision Therefore the Seller is not providing you a survey of your actual lots If you were to have the standard printed exception as to discrepancies and conflicts deleted we believe you would need a survey of your lots You will have seven days after you receive the Commitment andor the survey to object in writing to any matters disclosed or you will be deemed to waive such objections accordingly Therefore please make sure that we have the opportunity to review the survey and commitment as soon as possible after you receive same Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY We agree that this paragraph relating to the Sellers right to continue to show the property for sale should be deleted Paragraph PROPERTY CONDITION B We suggest that this paragraph be checked and utilized rather than paragraph B which states that you will be accepting the property in its present condition Paragraph B states that you will pay a fee usually very small like for the unrestricted right to terminate the contract in the event the property is not suitable for the purposes for which you intend on using it In other words you can have whatever inspectors you deem necessary to look at the property to make sure that it is satisfactory for your home construction We often suggest that an independent inspector be hired by the homeowner to inspect and review the construction of the home as it progresses In addition there may be some environmental issues or soil condition questions that an inspector might raise if given the opportunity As the Contract now reads you are simply accepting the property as is and have no right to send an inspector out to the property accordingly Paragraph BROKERS FEES You may want an affirmative statement that you as the Buyer will not be responsible for or pay any Brokers fees Paragraph SPECIAL PROVISIONS It is written in that the closing on these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March whichever is later However we do not know what roads are being addressed and think that this sentence needs far more specificity The second sentence regarding your obligation to use Flair Homes has already been addressed earlier The third sentence regarding when construction must start should be revised to give you more time as you make reference in your letter However we also suggest that the Builder be put under an obligation to start construction within thirty days after the date you notify him that you are ready for construction to begin Paragraph ROLLBACK TAXES If there was ever an agricultural or timber exemption on this property you need to know Otherwise you will be obligated to pay rollback taxes on the property which may go back five years Paragraph ESCROW As we indicated earlier we believe your earnest money should be paid to the title company In light of the fact that the earnest money is in excess of and the closing date on the lots is somewhat uncertain we suggest that you ask the title company to deposit the earnest money in an interest bearing account and that you receive a credit accordingly Please call us after you read and review this letter Very truly yours Donald S Stirman DSScsb

really wasnt a growth company They now have a stable cash flow but need a new beach head in the Middle East to demonstrate they are growing The point of this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being dumped into Saudi Arabia They characterized the Saudi perspective as being one where they are looking for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital They agree on a division of labor Oxy can do EP processing and petrochemicals and look to us for pipelines and power plants although Oxy can do those too They realize that only Enron has the marketing structuring and regulatory expertise Casey did revisit his conversation with you about in the end Enron ends up as some type of merchant banker Thats OK in the end Dale even said they would take over our part of any project but we cant project that role initially We need to be on the same side of the table as Oxy The point here is that we have to be in step with a consistent approach to the projects They expect our competitors to say theyll finance things on balance sheet and we need initially to say the same thing although later we will open discussions on other ways to finance Mike and I agree that this is probably the biggest sticking point in the discussion today Oxy believes that such an initial statement will never be public and we arent really locked in an onbalance sheet approach Maybe we can do this maybe we cant They see this as a year long process with PDAs stretching well into next year and when the real money would be spent The short term crisis is January and we need a submission with lots of pages we were criticized that although our proposal was well thought through and technically superb it didnt have enough pages reams of paper to impress the technocrats We will also need to prepare a smaller page digest to be used for our official February presentation and a three page walk around summary Casey thinks the production center has to be in the US We also all agreed that the Jan questions allow us to lay out all of our downstream concerns and establish a placeholder for issues that must be resolved during the PDA discussions before we would do a project I have had the greatest success around the world when we dont try to force immediately on a country a perfect gas or electric market but adapt to local conditions and implement the most important first couple of steps with the rest to follow later In this respect our projects can include suggested regulatory concepts that if successful can be used elsewhere in the Kingdom Over and over we came back to the project team which they want on the ground in Saudi Casey will be Saudi for the foreseeable future and can make all decisions Who will be our lead person with the same authority They dont want to deal with someone who later says Houston changed its mind a little arrogant When can we identify bodies and assignments and location They want full time dedicated people Either Dale or Casey noted that the old Enron would have parachuted a team in by now Like South America where we landed in a swamp and spent the next five years beating alligators over the head with a stick This is a very complicated political and technical effort The leader has to be good at both Casey was excited that Rob would be assigned to the project I guess you discussed this with him They both were quick to say that the working relationship to date has been excellent and that they appreciate the effort we have put into this Mike committed that we would go balls to the wall for the th deadline I committed that I would designate a project team by the first week in January we had our first conference call yesterday but Mike said he wanted to think about the decision point person and process we arent about to sacrifice a deliberative strategicconsensus thought process because they are in a hurry We spent a lot of time talking about the process We agree that the Saudis will eliminate one or two participants that each project will have subparts with different combinations and leads of companies with a master JV on top They minimized the capital investment although they are prepared to spent million over the next years They see core project costing million OxyEnron assuming one other partner and Enron half of that We arent talking billions spoken like a true major They are sure Exxon Mobil will be our Red Sea partner if only to earn face with possibly Marathon as the other Exxon is more interested in the chemical focus which Oxy will concede to them Mike noted was that our worst nightmare was a partner Exxon who would throw away money just to have a presence We were assured that Oxys only goal was to make money and if he projects didnt they would walk away The real danger in the upstream is the risk money for exploration Oxy hopes to hedge this risk with downstream investments pipelines and plants and hopes that if the exploration is successful and reserves are added it will lead to a whole new series of projects They are very proud of Oxys role in this claim that they were instrumental in getting Petry Parkman and Morgan selected as advisors that Irani is the most respected American Arab business man and has great access in the Kingdom and that they already know what investments partners are acceptable to the Saudis We all left great friends in good Christmas spirit From our perspective Saudi is the largest economy in the Middle east and the driver in international oil and liquids markets Enron needs to get inside and establish relationships with the key Saudi people We need a foot print in the Kingdom with which to earn their respect Can we do it with minimal capital investment Saudi is about to embark of a complete electric and gas restructuring regulatory included They want the repatriation of petro dollars and dollars held offshore by Saudi nationals The country can be a tremendous source of capital It looks like can be managed with a minimum burn rate with the most intense period of activity being in January We need to set up the team for the January effort Ill have this done by Jan There is the question of sorting out conflicts with other ME priorities Although it may be too soon to answer we dont know yet what is possible but we can shape that outcome what is the end game what do we want out of Saudi Arabia We seem to have a clear division of labor and strategy with Oxy although we need to sort out what we say about on balance sheet financing We also need to keep in mind that our other yet to be met partners will have a lot to say Oxy wants to take the lead on the Core Venture Red Sea I agree this is a perfect laboratory to address all of the market structure issues that will make the Kingdom a great place to do business Mike Im sure you can add more Rick its up to you if you want to send this around to the Saudi team Merry Christmas

NRONDEVELOPMENt Eric CT cc Subject Re Jose LNG Crude Pricing Per a conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the Houston office the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent on a year deal is NOT a possibility If we had of our GSA price linked to Brent our exposure for years would be about million barrels notional or about million barrels PV At our exposure would still be million notional or million PV According to John he would not be comfortable doing anything past and even out that far he would not consider doing more than about million PV barrels in the years Given these comments I would say that the size of our deal basically precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time As far as the economics of the deal are concerned we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to figure out our economics I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see if we could get a year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that the hedging costs would be too high and therefore have left it at that for the time being Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue Thanks Eric Guido NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Eric CT cc Emilio VicensENRON NRON CT Larry CT Cris CT Brent A CT Eric CT Daniel R RogersENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Jose LNG Offtake Comments Eric thanks for your comments Please see below in blue our observations and answers Lets talk later today if you have further questions Saludos Guido and Emilio Enron Offtake Agreement Section Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the EPC agreement Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers In addition it preserves your year offtake which should still match your GSA The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen that being the earlier of months after Financial Close or NTP or Dec We will add to this list the earlier of something like the date on which the plant has produced LNG at at least of its capacity for a period of consecutive days We suggest putting something like this as opposed to commercial hand over because this is in the plantscontractors control and they could for example on purpose not meet a noise level requirement for months for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project but we as offtakers can not wait for ever for the project to be completed with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow directly or indirectly under the projects control We have months limits to how much the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC or another EPC Contractor already built in Section I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of We agree that would be better but we included this section knowing that is something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA because they dont want us to sell down and then keep controlling new LNG businesses in Jose They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA We think that adding a restriction to the assets returns now in the draft will make it very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause Thus jeopardizing our chance to control the output of future plants or expansions We never intended to use these offtake agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes Nevertheless we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial control of the output Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will clearly realize what our intent is Section Where is the bonus calculation We did not include it now on purpose We will include it when ever they remind us to do so We want to have another fight about the bonus Where is the min price The minimum price is in We say that one of the terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number We are going to try to do it but that is first a GSA issue and we dont want to put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA We precisely bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we want to make it zero Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics No we dont have the definitive answer from structuring yet but our guess and based on our meeting with RAC the other day in which they told us about the mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba Brazil power plant we are pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not convenient But since we dont have a definitive answer yet we still included oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting that should have been bracketed in the termsheet though and it will Section you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate Is this your intent to have a mismatch Yes we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as offtaker and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if they do you have all new taxes being borne by the project company Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized See section of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue The exporter of record will be the project so the buyer has no business in Venezuela other than paying port fees We do not see any kind of taxes that could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred to the project Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that projects typically take all the time the heavy crude projects are some examples in Venezuela In addition the GSA provides for a number of reliefs for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel safer Although a large portion of the underlying risk is always there Other where are the LD calculations explained I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default GSA default should match LDs in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better New York law provides for full market based damages market price of commodity plus extra costs which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD clause So from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it as it is We are still discussing w Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is sellable to AA for MTM but our initial view is that it should be since the level of LD can not be better GSA default is market based provided that PDVSA as we expect accepts the change we will propose so the Project Company will be able to pay market based damages For interruption of gas supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being relieved from performance in such event this will obviously be to a maximum dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time say months we need time to give you precision on this but some sort of coverage will be available suppose the plant produces less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems not a FM issue at commercial hand over What happens under the offtake agreements Will the banks accept this revenue short fall Will we have to create a reserve This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry Under the offtake agreements the project pays market based damages if it does not meet the contracted volume We believe that the contracted volume that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks and equity holders to bear the risk We are contracting for contractually guaranteed production under the EPC which is lower than expected On top of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible meaning a lower LNG volume This volume is lower than the guaranteed production with Normal or expected feed composition Combining these two we have a contracted quantity that is lower than the expected production with expected feed On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least above what was expected mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs Also the EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equityholders whole They dont provide though for damages payable under offtake contracts nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs However as we explained we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co Banks will most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption as we already did What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is resolved what compensation do the offtakers get do the banks suffer here as well The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to determine failure to deliver by Seller It also establishes that deliveries should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant The bottom line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of defaults and price differentials It sets however a reasonable standard by which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur based on the reasonable constant deliveries provision damages will be payable based on prices during such month Yes banks suffer here to the extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable Nevertheless short periods weeks of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect the Project Company ability to pay the Banks It will have to be some prolonged period for Banks to be affected Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first days Will the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established Is this in your model We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard although we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected Our model assumes the cost of an LC for month debt service which should be plenty The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather damages not BI are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not permitted for MTM reasons The question that follows is if damages exceed the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its obligation to deliver have the damages have to be senior to debt payments for AA to allow MTM to be permitted If this is so are the banks going to be willing to live with this probably not insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling It is briefly covered in section second paragraph This will be expended in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to PDVSA insert termination section In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an offtaker than an asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law than if we try to right an early termination clause They point out also that of LNG contracts are done in this way having NY law rule the game They point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements for financing requirements We will Eric CT AM To Guido CarantiENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Emilio VicensENRON NRONDEVELOPMENt cc Larry nron Cris CT Brent A CT Eric CT Daniel R RogersENRON

the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers In addition it preserves your year offtake which should still match your GSA Section I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of Section Where is the bonus calculation Where is the min price I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics Section you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate Is this your intent to have a mismatch you have all new taxes being borne by the project company Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalised See section of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue Other where are the LD calculations explained I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default GSA default should match LDs in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery suppose the plant produces less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems not a FM issue at commercial hand over What happens under the offtake agreements Will the banks accept this revenue short fall Will we have to create a reserve This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry What happens if plant starts

explain what the effort potentially create Thanks Eric Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Eric Groves To Guido CarantiENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Emilio VicensENRON NRONDEVELOPMENt Eric CT cc Subject Re Jose LNG Crude Pricing Per a conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the Houston office the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent on a year deal is NOT a possibility If we had of our GSA price linked to Brent our exposure for years would be about million barrels notional or about million barrels PV At our exposure would still be million notional or million PV According to John he would not be comfortable doing anything past and even out that far he would not consider doing more than about million PV barrels in the years Given these comments I would say that the size of our deal basically precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time As far as the economics of the deal are concerned we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to figure out our economics I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see if we could get a year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that the hedging costs would be too high and therefore have left it at that for the time being Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue Thanks Eric Guido NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Eric CT cc Emilio VicensENRON NRON CT Larry CT Cris CT Brent A CT Eric CT

questions Saludos Guido and Emilio Enron Offtake Agreement Section Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the EPC agreement Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers In addition it preserves your year offtake which should still match your GSA The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen that being the earlier of months after Financial Close or NTP or Dec We will add to this list the earlier of something like the date on which the plant has produced LNG at at least of its capacity for a period of consecutive days We suggest putting something like this as opposed to commercial hand over because this is in the plantscontractors control and they could for example on purpose not meet a noise level requirement for months for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project but we as offtakers can not wait for ever for the project to be completed with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow directly or indirectly under the projects control We have months limits to how much the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC or another EPC Contractor already built in Section I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of We agree that would be better but we included this section knowing that is something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA because they dont want us to sell down and then keep controlling new LNG businesses in Jose They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA We think that adding a restriction to the assets returns now in the draft will make it very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause Thus jeopardizing our chance to control the output of future plants or expansions We never intended to use these offtake agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes Nevertheless we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial control of the output Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will clearly realize what our intent is Section Where is the bonus calculation We did not include it now on purpose We will include it when ever they remind us to do so We want to have another fight about the bonus Where is the min price The minimum price is in We say that one of the terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number We are going to try to do it but that is first a GSA issue and we dont want to put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA We precisely bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we want to make it zero Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics No we dont have the definitive answer from structuring yet but our guess and based on our meeting with RAC the other day in which they told us about the mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba Brazil power plant we are pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not convenient But since we dont have a definitive answer yet we still included oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting that should have been bracketed in the termsheet though and it will Section you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate Is this your intent to have a mismatch Yes we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as offtaker and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if they do you have all new taxes being borne by the project company Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized See section of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue The exporter of record will be the project so the buyer has no business in Venezuela other than paying port fees We do not see any kind of taxes that could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred to the project Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that projects typically take all the time the heavy crude projects are some examples in Venezuela In addition the GSA provides for a number of reliefs for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel safer Although a large portion of the underlying risk is always there Other where are the LD calculations explained I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default GSA default should match LDs in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better New York law provides for full market based damages market price of commodity plus extra costs which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD clause So from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it as it is We are still discussing w Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is sellable to AA for MTM but our initial view is that it should be since the level of LD can not be better GSA default is market based provided that PDVSA as we expect accepts the change we will propose so the Project Company will be able to pay market based damages For interruption of gas supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being relieved from performance in such event this will obviously be to a maximum dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time say months we need time to give you precision on this but some sort of coverage will be available suppose the plant produces less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems not a FM issue at commercial hand over What happens under the offtake agreements Will the banks accept this revenue short fall Will we have to create a reserve This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry Under the offtake agreements the project pays market based damages if it does not meet the contracted volume We believe that the contracted volume that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks and equity holders to bear the risk We are contracting for contractually guaranteed production under the EPC which is lower than expected On top of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible meaning a lower LNG volume This volume is lower than the guaranteed production with Normal or expected feed composition Combining these two we have a contracted quantity that is lower than the expected production with expected feed On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least above what was expected mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs Also the EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equityholders whole They dont provide though for damages payable under offtake contracts nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs However as we explained we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co Banks will most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption as we already did What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is resolved what compensation do the offtakers get do the banks suffer here as well The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to determine failure to deliver by Seller It also establishes that deliveries should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant The bottom line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of defaults and price differentials It sets however a reasonable standard by which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur based on the reasonable constant deliveries provision damages will be payable based on prices during such month Yes banks suffer here to the extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable Nevertheless short periods weeks of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect the Project Company ability to pay the Banks It will have to be some prolonged period for Banks to be affected Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first days Will the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established Is this in your model We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard although we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected Our model assumes the cost of an LC for month debt service which should be plenty The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather damages not BI are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not permitted for MTM reasons The question that follows is if damages exceed the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its obligation to deliver have the damages have to be senior to debt payments for AA to allow MTM to be permitted If this is so are the banks going to be willing to live with this probably not insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling It is briefly covered in section second paragraph This will be expended in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to PDVSA insert termination section In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an offtaker than an asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law than if we try to right an early termination clause They point out also that of LNG contracts are done in this way having NY law rule the game They point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct

Katy CT Vance NRON John AmblerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Juiced ComputerWorld Juiced By Julia King and Gary H Anthes Nov Wall Street analysts and oil industry executives were thick among the legion of skeptics who thought Enron Corp President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling was nuts to launch a Web site for the trading of natural gas and electricity over the Internet That was last November before EnronOnline locked up more than billion in transactions in its first few months of operation quickly establishing itself as the worlds largest ecommerce company As of Oct just prior to Enrons report of its thirdquarter earnings EnronOnline had executed more than transactions representing a gross value of billion Since then the billion Houstonbased energy giant has elbowed its way into several new diversified markets And it plans to continue its push into many more ranging from railcar cargo space to broadband networking and datastorage capacity In doing so Enron is turbocharging its transformation from a stodgy oldline fuel company to an entirely new kind of businesstobusiness market maker with information technology and an allout emphasis on entrepreneurship at the heart of its New Economy operations Enron has been so successful in leveraging IT to pioneer new markets that others are trying to emulate its approach First to Market Enron often introduces a product before the competition even senses a market exists the company says in its latest annual report A prime example online trading of datanetwork capacity Indeed theres a low degree of awareness among carriers about the bandwidthtrading business and Enron is ahead of the game says Seth Libby an analyst at The Yankee Group in Boston At present there are only a handful of network professionals who are aware of these capacity commoditization plans says Libby But not for long asserts Enron President Jeff Skilling Within five years the bandwidth market may be bigger than the gas and electric markets he says So for us it could be as big as the rest of our existing energy business Thats currently a billion business But critics say trading bandwidth is much more complicated than trading gas especially for a company with little depth in telecommunications And critics add that although carriers stand to benefit from the ability to buy and sell capacity they might prefer to do it through some channel thats independent of the control of a single market maker like Enron Enrons argument is that its trading capabilities are the differentiator and that it need not have deep telecom expertise says Lisa Pierce an analyst at Giga Information Group in Stamford Conn But Im not convinced its that simple Technology isnt a longterm competitive differentiator Houstonbased Enron Broadband Services Inc formed last year offers IP transport on its mile fiberoptic network Enron Broadband Services also trades that is makes a market by buying and selling network capacity to and from other data carriers conducting some of the transactions on EnronOnline Enron Broadband Services also offers contentoriented services such as a videoondemand service it will market with Dallasbased Blockbuster Inc to home viewers starting next month When we started the gas business they told us we were nuts Skilling says They said Youre going to sell gas but not own production How does that work Then we did electricity and they said we were nuts again and even louder than before They said this stuff moves at the speed of light you can never create a market Then in telecommunications they said we were nuts again Despite its share of skeptics some experts like Enrons prospects in this space I think aspects of this have the potential to be very big says Libby The carriers like the idea of instantaneous provisioning And I think it has a lot of potential for selling it to businesses and giving them the ability to cut their costs significantly by buying it as they need it We aspire to that kind of model says Fred Buehler director of electronic business at Eastman Chemical Co in Kingsport Tenn In every sector there will be one or two innovators who get out front and do things differently to create shareholder value Buehler says Were trying to be one of them Market Maker Stroll through the gastrading section on the nd floor of Enrons glistening story headquarters and the companys technological sophistication is immediately evident Traders like yearold John Arnold who personally executes about billion per day in trades have realtime access to virtually any information that might affect their splitsecond buyandsell decisions That information might be a meteorologists prediction of a colderthannormal winter across the Plains states or a live news report of political instability in an oilproducing country in the Middle East Behind the scenes all of Arnolds trades are instantly analyzed and processed by a sophisticated proprietary riskmanagement system and then updated across multiple backend computer systems worldwide Less than a year after launching the operation of the worlds gas is traded on EnronOnline What we are doing no one in the industry did years ago Eighty percent of our income this year is from businesses that didnt exist years ago says Skilling For example EnronOnline contributed heavily to its parent companys thirdquarter earnings which were up to million compared with the same period last year The change is technologydriven Skilling adds We couldnt do what we do without massive amounts of computing capability In this regard Enron joins a short list of companies that includes WalMart Stores Inc FedEx Corp and American Airlines Inc which famously pioneered various missioncritical IT techniques to leapfrog competitors and create a whole new class of ITenabled industry leaders Among Enrons boldest ideas is its use of a single powerful softwarebased trading platform to insert itself as a principal buyer or seller in hundreds of different markets Currently Enron trades more than different commodities such as gold natural gas and metals on EnronOnline The core of our business is our business model which is a centralized riskmanagement and marketmaking business model It just so happens that the Internet is just perfect for improving the efficiency of that model Skilling says But as a market maker EnronOnline stands alone For starters unlike most other Internet marketplaces its free There are no transaction fees or catalog inventory or subscription costs for users Enron has broken away from the pack in the last year in terms of their capital growth says Ian Wylie vice president of ebusiness at BP Amoco PLC in London And ebusiness is responsible for a lot of this change Even more unusual is Enrons role as a principal in each transaction That means Enron is either the buyer or seller in every trade in which its involved unlike market makers that simply act as matchmakers between buyers and sellers In fact Skilling as well as Mike McConnell who heads EnronOnlines global expansion efforts as president and CEO of Enron Global Markets LLC dismisses much of the current hyperactivity surrounding other feebased businesstobusiness exchanges as a flash in the pan Many of the BB guys think all you have to do is set up a bulletin board and people will start transacting but it doesnt work that way Skilling says You need to know you can deliver if push comes to shove As either the seller or buyer in all of its trades Enron an established brand name with miles of pipeline and deep financial pockets guarantees delivery or payment on all trades that are executed on EnronOnline Were creating markets that were highly illiquid so someone has to put their reputation on the line to say Well deliver Skilling says But guaranteeing delivery also requires having guaranteed access to physical assets such as network bandwidth and papermaking plants Guaranteed access also ensures marketplace liquidity For Enron this is where the bricks and mortar come in For example to help drive its liquidity in the pulp and paper market Enron paid million in July for Garden State Paper Co a recyclednewsprint mill in Garfield NJ Skillings current market fancy is metals and in May Enron bought MG PLC a Londonbased metals marketer You have to break the liquidity logjam and to do that you have to take a risk position Skilling says But once the logjam is cleared Enron is just as likely to sell off the brickandmortar assets it acquired and use the cash to invest in new business For example to finance its new bandwidthtrading operation Enron is selling Portland General Electric Co a Portland Orebased power producer that it bought in so it could bring liquidity to and guarantee trades in the online electricity market Eventually Enron may end up trading commodities that arent even considered commodities at least not at the moment such as data storage capacity or empty railcar space Might we move into sauces or meats or grains Potentially says McConnell who was Enrons de facto CIO before moving into his current role You have to be creative every day McConnell says You have to be openminded to trying new things But what remains constant throughout all the upsizing and downsizing is Enrons core ITenabled business model which is what puts it in a class of its own analysts say People have talked a lot about systems that theyre about to roll out but there is just not much out there for direct trading says Mike Heim an energy analyst at AG Edwards Sons Inc in St Louis Enron rolled out its technology months ago and still there isnt much else out there There hasnt been much competition because there isnt anybody in the same class But just last month Houstonbased Dynegy Inc launched Dynegydirect an Internetbased commissionfree trading site for energy and communications commodities Also last month IntercontinentalExchange in Atlanta whose partners include BP Amoco and The Haguebased Royal DutchShell Group added natural gas and power to its online trading system which already included precious metals and crude oil Skilling doesnt get called nuts much anymore In fact hes a darling on Wall Street where Enrons stock has soared from around per share last November to as of this Nov As a result Enron by all accounts an Old Economy gas pipeline company until months ago is widely regarded as a New Economy pioneer Says Skilling We like to say we were BB before there was BB Thriving On the Unconventional As head of two Enron pipeline subsidiaries Mike McConnell knew a lot more about gas flows than he did about data flows last year when he got a surprise call from Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling Recalls McConnell Jeff went into this whole thought process about how the Internet is changing everything He said We need to make Enron an ebusiness and I need a guy that can run this as a business We need to change the way we view technology I thought he was a little crazy and I said Jeff Im not a technology person at all He said No seriously this is going to be big So I took over as CEO of Enron Global Technology and thus became the companys de facto CIO McConnell explains Appointing a person with no technology background to the top IT post is an unusual move But Enron often defies convention and typically thrives as a result Indeed Enron boasts an entrepreneurial culture thats unusual in large longestablished companies and in utilities firms in particular McConnell relates the tale of how yearold Louise Kitchen Enrons head gas trader in Europe spearheaded the creation of an online gastrading system recruiting IT people from elsewhere in the company to do the development work Word of the Webbased platform EnronOnline which is literally remaking the company didnt reach top management until a few weeks before it went live Kitchen enlisted the support of Enrons initially skeptical top traders and she scoured the company for software developers and other experts Her small army of volunteers worked nights and weekends on the project while carrying on with their regular jobs Its an amazing story about not getting corporate approval and going through all the bureaucracy McConnell says No one went to the board and said We want to change the way we trade You just do it Glowing Endorsement Soon after McConnell became the de facto CIO of the billion energy company he joined eight of Sun Microsystems Incs top Houston customers at a breakfast hosted by Sun CEO Scott McNealy I was very nervous recalls McConnell I mean McNealy is the guy and here I know nothing about technology Id been on the job maybe two weeks McNealy asked the attendees all but McConnell were middleaged CIOs with many years of IT experience to introduce themselves in turn When Scott came to me I said Im the CEO of Global Technology and we want to be the leader in BB commerce in the world He kind of sat back and said How long have you been in the IT business McConnell explains About nine days I said and we are going to take a little bit different approach to technology Scott chuckled and said That sounds like Enron it always looks at things differently He then stated that my CEO title and Enrons approach were very unusual but that it would be more commonplace soon as this was the way of the future McConnell says McNealys endorsement had a huge impact on how he structured IT at Enron during the following year I realized that we werent too late to change our approach and take a commercial view of technology he says a view of IT as an integral part of the business not as something that supports business functions None of the other companies were thinking our new way at all Taking a commercial view of IT has led to a blurring of the line that traditionally separates IT organizations from the business units they support When McConnell became CEO of Global Technology Enron had five CIOs who were predominantly operating independently inside the companys major lines of business Each CIO had his own agenda his own thought process his own goals and they did not communicate at all he says McConnell established corporate standards for IT created a management team that included the five CIOs and put all IT people under a new chief technology officer Philippe Bibi But IT is far from centralized at Enron We wanted to make people think about technology not as IT and support but as an extension of your business he explains So we seeded people out into the business units IT directs the performance review process but the business units have the greatest influence on where the person actually ranks and is rated Firms like Enron that merge IT departments with the business units they serve will be the winners among fastpaced ebusinesses says IT organization expert Robert Zawacki president of Zawacki and Associates in Colorado Springs and a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado also in Colorado Springs We need more entrepreneurial leaders in IT and McConnell is certainly one he says IT makes it easier to be entrepreneurial says McConnell who is now president and CEO of Enron Global Markets We really do like to try things and see what happens and when you have an electronic platform like EnronOnline that we can model into different sectors its very inexpensive to try it We are not afraid if its not working well just stop Gary H Anthes and Julia King

thanks for all of the support in the placement of the former CALME employees We are done to just a very few at this time It appears that your new squad is getting some traction on building the LNG business Im pleased to hear that I look forward to hearing how our transportation or logistics business is developing Perhaps we can get together sometime during the San Antonio conference to catch up All the best Shawn PS the following is an interesting article about the online intermodal landscape Hashing Out Ecommerce JOHN GALLAGHER Traffic World Page Copyright Gale Group Inc All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Journal of Commerce Inc Dotcoms explain how they hope to compete in intermodal market and among themselves With some websites devoted to transportation ecommerce companies acknowledge that its difficult for potential customers to cut through the confusion and figure out whos doing what and whos going to be with them for the long term Because of the competition between their respective railroad partners one of the bigger questions for intermodal shippers is the relationship between Arzoon and Freightwise There has been speculation that after Freightwise was established by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway four competitors Union Pacific Railroad Norfolk Southern CSX and Canadian Pacific Railway teamed up with rival ecommerce site Arzoon in a response to BNSFs proposed merger with Canadian National Railway However both Freightwise and Arzoon claim thats not the case Im continually asked Whats up with the four railroads and Arzoon said Charley Eisele UP senior vice president strategic planning People are trying to make a whole lot out of the coincidence of these two things from a timing perspective The reality is it was a decision made on the underlying business model Freightwise executives agree with that assessment pointing out that because the industry happened to be divided along merger lines at the same time the railroads were aligning with ecommerce initiatives it seemed too much of a coincidence that the same four railroads opposing the merger were the ones joining Arzoon However I think to launch a company like this takes more than just a reaction to a merger said Freightwise Chief Marketing Officer Sanjay Joshi There are major differences between the two Internet companies starting with their business plans Arzoon categorizes itself as a shippercentric transportation management system whose target market is the roughly percent of the transportation business that currently moves under contract Freightwise on the other hand classifies itself as a transportation exchange and is targeting the remaining percent of the market procured on a spot basis Arzoon whose primary focus is the shipper is setting out to help manage the relationships that already exist between shipper and carrier The priority for carrierfocused Freightwise is to make sure the capacity is there for shippers who log on to their system In addition Arzoon which currently is involved only with rail and truck wants eventually to become a transportation management system that manages across all modes and borders including ocean and air freight said Eisele Freightwise will stick to truckload and intermodal for the time being Were not sure about getting involved with air freight given the size of the market and the economics said Joshi It takes a different set of products and economics than surface transportation Maybe sometime down the line but right now we really plan on getting entrenched in the truckload and intermodal spot market We think thats a lot to chew The key is to focus on a particular footprint that we can begin to own rather than get too broad and lose focus The fact that Arzoon and Freightwise have teamed up with different rail carriers is another cause for concern Will there be a disincentive on the part of carriers to use each others ecommerce initiatives and ultimately therefore a disadvantage for prospective customers The answer is the rule said a source from an Arzoon rail partner A particular shipper is in a position where percent of their business is conducted via truck and other modes and maybe only percent via railroads If the choice presented to them is to select a system that addresses all modes effectively or one that only addresses a particular mode then the rule would suggest that greater leverage would lie in picking the broader multimode transportation management system In that case even though a railroad may have another ecommerce approach it would clearly have to respond to the customers needs in that situation Freightwises Joshi makes a similar argument Freightwise is merely another channel for BNSF to market its services he said It posts a certain set of rates for what it believes to be fair for the service Its not for Freightwise to decide what rates BNSF decides to move through its channel UP may not decide to post its rates on Freightwise Joshi said so then BNSF would have to find out whats the competitive rate relative to UP Another question arises as to whether Arzoon may have a competitive advantage over Freightwise particularly from an intermodal standpoint because it is backed by both Eastern and Western carriers whereas Freightwise is backed only by BNSF I would only say that the partnership we have with BNSF is not exclusive and that were talking to other railroads as well Joshi noted He added This is an exchange to market your capacity and services It would be very difficult for six railroads to do something on their own there would be no critical mass Its to the advantage of the other railroads to participate Along with BNSF which provides Freightwise with instant capacity the company recently signed GE Corp as an anchor tenant and equity investor that will help Freightwise reach the critical mass Joshi talks about As both a major supplier to the rail industry locomotives and a potential shipper appliances the goal is to use GE as something we can leverage and work with their respective divisions as a way to reduce their transportation costs he said Visibility is a key advantage for potential customers of both Interment companies As a transportation management system with access to all modes it allows shippers to be more efficient in the management of transportation Eisele said Crossmodal visibility means that because theyll be managing their truck business under the same system as rail the economics of rail will be much more visible And we believe that with comparable reliability the economics will be compelling to the point where rails will garner a greater share of those customers total transportation buy Joshi claims a big difference between Freightwise and other exchanges is that when a shipper is looking for transportation options between specific origindestination pairs Freightwise allows customers to make sidebyside comparisons between truck and intermodal It is this price and service transparency Joshi says that will save its customers money Were giving customers three to five choices between truck and intermodal not so that they can see service and price parameters Intermodal ecommerce ventures such as Freightwise also bring up the question of competition with traditional intermodal marketing companies Joshi points out that its fee for doing a lot of what small and midsize IMCs do currently such as load matching tracking and tracing and order processing is percent which is split between the buyer and seller of the services This compares to the to percent that customers traditionally have paid for retaining an IMC I dont think all brokers will embrace us Joshi conceded but at the same time there will be a segment of brokers who will begin migrating into higheraddedvalue services for example the thirdparty logistics side rather than the classical brokerage Theyll get into things like inventory management on behalf of shippers and leave backend processing to firms like Freightwise Webmodal which is a purely intermodal ecommerce venture whose vision is to make intermodal much more like truck in the eyes of the shipper points out that it can take customers several days to receive a bid from a traditional IMC We can immediately configure door to door intermodal solutions that we can put together using our underlying carrier relationships said Webmodal founder and CEO Chris Kravas We do business with a lot of large US railroads and with drayage companies We give everybody access to all the information they might need to make decisions on price vs service tradeoffs and which carriers make most sense based on what the shipper is trying to do And we do it without the traditional onetothreeday wait that typically happens in response to a normal request for intermodal services Kravas said the company has invested time and expertise in developing what it calls a firstever schedule engine that works door to door Traditionally the industry hasnt had a schedule engine that involves the drayplusrailplusdray services so theres been pretty much a reliance on rules of thumb But the truth is it doesnt take anywhere near eight days for most origindestination pairs We have a very robust way of representing the capabilities of the dray carriers as well as the rail carriers so that much more trucklike transit can be shown to be viable Because of this Webmodal sees itself as more of a technology and ecommerce company than a traditional IMC and considers itself more a vendor than a competitor How does a small or midsize IMC work as a customer of Webmodal Not all small IMCs are set up to do business with all of the railroads or with a large set of drayage companies Kravas said What we do for them is give them a lowcost way to access a comprehensive array of intermodal products and services available in the US Weve established ourselves as a business partner with a large base of firstrate drayage companies across the country So if youre an IMC with an opportunity to handle freight in a new market Webmodal allows you to put together a service and pay only a modest fee Kravas wouldnt disclose the companys fee structure only that it charges per shipment for a webbased order and a slightly higher fee for a phone or fax order A smaller IMC also could use Webmodal to put in place a private version of its technology that would enable the IMC to better manage its business That would range from pricing order fulfillment customer service kind of the whole spectrum of capabilities that would allow an IMC to take advantage of our system Kravas said Everyones waiting to see whos going to survive the transportation dotcom fallout Before that happens however Freightwise may find itself as big a competitor with Arzoon as it is with a company like Webmodal Were starting from different points said Freightwises Joshi but down the line yes I can see more headtohead competition between the two companies In addition to establishing itself in that percent of the market devoted to transportation contracts UPs Eisele notes that Arzoon also has a catalogcapability function which eventually can be used to auction capacity in the spot market the market in which Freightwise is establishing itself We will very much have the capability to enable spot market buying he said As Webmodals Kravas pointed out Its going to be an interesting next six months ArzoonAT Kearney partnership Consulting firm AT Kearney a unit of Dallasbased EDS and Arzoon which provides Internetbased services for managing transportation work processes worldwide have formed a strategic alliance AT Kearney was one of the first to establish a dedicated practice helping shippers manage transportation more effectively on a global basis Its clients now will have direct exposure to Arzoons transportation management trading network which provides online services for managing the full life cycle of work processes across all modes systems and enterprises Similarly Arzoon and its clients can access select AT Kearney consulting services the company said That includes inbound transportation management supplychain and distribution rationalization carrier selection and process improvement Arzoon said Superior transportation management has emerged as a critical success factor in the increasingly competitive world of commerce said Randy Garber transportation services coleader of AT Kearneys operations services practice We think service companies manufacturers and retailers that incorporate the speed simplicity and efficiency of the Internet into their supply chains will lead their markets The plan is for both AT Kearney and Arzoon to gain valuable understanding and insights into how the Internet creates great efficiencies in both the strategic and tactical needs of transportation professionals Garber added We believe that the knowledge gained from this collaboration will benefit our clients as well as Arzoons customers involved in the trillion global freight transportation market Garber said An Arzoon official said the company was very pleased to be associated with AT Kearney which Arzoon described

last couple of days and I understand that OU has a different recruiting schedule then other schools Enron is on campus for recruiting in the near future a nd I have asked Sally to tag on some interviews for summer interns while on th at trip I believe that she has been able to schedule this so I believe that from an OU perspective it may be a mute point now Doing that should be ab le to maintain the momentum that we have developed at OU and all the work Lexi has done By the way the recruiting trip a couple of weeks ago was very successful If you have any other questions or comments please let me know mike Charlene NRON AM To Sally CT cc Celeste CT Richard NRON Mike CT Subject Re Hiring Practices for Summer Interns Sally Thanks for the email regarding summer interns I apologize that Lexi and Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking I wis h that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin g difficulty I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any member of my staff was not responsive That being said please allow me to explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set it You are absolutely correct It is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge As you are aware over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm Brecker Merryman who has assisted us in a number of different mark et research projects However in my opinion this issue is not one that required much research I have been involved in recruiting in some way shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past years Most major organizations with the exception of the Accounting firm s begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring There are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date particularly in the MBA programs For example Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until January As indicated the firms that generally recrui t in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for spring internships The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns Presentations were made in January February and offers were made in February and March The only school that did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope We did of course recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enrons ability to hire quality s ummer interns This past summer Enron had summer Analysts undergraduate and summer Associates graduate We intentionally limited the number of summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful assignments Approximately of these individuals received permanent offers to join Enron The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire undergraduates for summer positions They generally focus on MBAs particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enrons competitors Because the undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have continued to have a special focus on these individuals ie the reason the re were undergraduates and only MBAs With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about which you raised a concern let me address your concerns In your email y ou indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU You did not howeve r provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU While OU has not gotten back to her following is the information obtained from UT o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson o According to Cindy approximately of companies actively recruiting on campus conduct interviews in the fall for summer internships Cindy attributes this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring or in the case of Andersen Consulting have a tremendous need and conduct all interviews at one time o In conclusion Cindy estimated that of companies actively recruiting on campus recruit in the spring for summer internships We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t he statistics at this time I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such information It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably different than what we were told If you would provide the name of the individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for the discrepancies While I understand your concern with respect to OU they appear to be different than most of the other schools at which we recruit If you belie ve that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are supportive however because Lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently As you are aware in most instances the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early August If you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts I hope this has been helpful I can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager Again I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i f you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance Charlene

HR team today or towmorrow essentially clarifying responsibilities following the formation of EGM and EIM I do not intend to circulate outside HR other than to then of you Cindy O and the other HR leads This essentially reflects what I hope you already know that your HR lead support is ENA Me with Sheila Knudsen I ultimately hope Cindy Skinner will move to take this lead sometime next year EGM Cindy Skinner and Shanna Funkhouser We believe Shanna will develop to lead this in the next months EIM Me and Fran Mayes the plan would be for Fran to eventually take lead on this when she is ready Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns David TO ALL ENA HR CC Olson Delainey Lavorato Frevert McMahon Bowen McConnell Shankman R Jones MBarnard MJoyce DLynch BVanCleve From Oxley Western Hemisphere Wholesale Energy HR Group Organisation Change When we launched our HR Franchise Team structure in February this year we did so with the commitment to continually refine and challenge ourselves to ensure we were optimising the resources we have available to help our businesses achieve and exceed their goals In fact you will recall in communicating the changes in February we actually highlighted what we anticipated would be a need to make further refinements and changes to maximise our effectiveness A great deal has happened in these last months and I am delighted that the Franchise team concept has contributed so much towards our far greater partnership with our individual business groups and our own outlook priorities and objectives We truly have revolutionised how we provide HR services and advice More importantly the business has recognised us for the huge progress we have made to date This success is an outstanding achievement and one that I hope you join me in being extremely proud of As is always the case at Enron continuous change is the norm and so as to illustrate this point quite effectively the businesses previously part of ENA have over the last months essentially been split into three Enron Global Markets set up to focus on the Global Fuels markets which were previously part of Enron Europe and CALME Coal Financial Tarding and InsuranceWeather which were all previously part of ENA EGM is now led by Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman Enron Industrial Markets set up to focus on the Industrial markets and expand our activities across new Industrial sectors which will build on the success of the Paper Pulp and Lumber business previously part of ENA and immediately develop a steel market EIM is led by Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen Enron North America remains the largest of these three businesses even after these changes and will now focus all of its efforts on the highly successful Gas and Power markets in North America including Canada and Mexico ENA continues to be led by Dave Delainey and John Lavorato Mark Frevert following his return from Europe has been instrumental in the restructuring of these businesses and is Chairman of each of these as well as Enron Europe which collectively now constitute Enrons entire activities in the Wholesale commodity markets These changes in the businesses we support clearly force us to reexamine the HR business model and adjust our strategy accordingly Fortunately our flexible organisation structure lends itself extremely well to realign along these new business lines and as such the changes illustrated below in the attached org chart are far easier for us to make than they might otherwise have been In addition given the immense value and positive client feedback we have received on our efforts to concentrate our HR resources on Franchise skill lines this also provides us with an opportunity to reinforce and refine our efforts in developing market intelligence employment propositions compensation ideas and best practices as well as the innovatively sourced talent pipelines in each of these areas to proactively provide our clients with a competitive advantage I believe the changes outlined on the attached org chart are self explanatory however if you have any questions please feel free to raise them either with your team leads or me Given that we have a staff meeting scheduled for Friday I would plan to walk through these changes with you and answer any questions at that time Finally to reinforce our goals and prepare you all for the next months I would like to underline the overall commitment to continue to change and flex our resources to anticipate meet and exceed our businesses needs This will clearly mean further organisation changes as we move forward This is not Change for changes sake but change and our ability to change quickly and as often as necessary is essential for us to remain a competitive and effective HR resource for our clients

Generation Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman I am sending this email to you pursuant to the Enron Corp Policy on Noncompetition I would appreciate if you would check with your CEOCOO regarding this email and respond to me by Friday September if you have questions or concerns Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions that bind Enron affiliates by Monday October Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific Enron Asia PacificAfricaChina Enron APACHI is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company Newco Newco would be charged with making the shareholders investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders respective stakes in Newco The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a dumping ground for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia As a result Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the MarubeniEnron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates The following is a summary of these competition provisions Enron affiliates with the exceptions stated below could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region as defined below after first offering the opportunity to Newco If Newco declines the opportunity Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction OM offtaker or risk management services There are a number of exceptions to this rule a small projects involving MW or less b projects in which Enron owns less than a interest c projects initiated by our SK joint venture d Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron e projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than of the value of the acquisition and f situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction Affiliates will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publiclyowned eg Azurix Asia Pacific Region will be defined to include Brunei China including Hong Kong and Macau South Korea North Korea Taiwan Vietnam Laos Cambodia Thailand Myanmar the Philippines Malaysia Indonesia East Timor Singapore Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands including Guam Saipan the Federated States of Micronesia and Fiji but excluding Hawaii It does not include Japan and Australia The competition clause would survive until the earlier of a Enron selling its interest in Newco or b December Thank you Bruce Lundstrom General Counsel Enron APACHI

can discuss this more at length in Mumbai this coming week Metgas is the only company that has any access to DPCs terminal As you know DPC is owned today by Enron MSEB GE and Bechtel At year end Enrons will be split to Enron and new investor Any changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC which is heavily influenced but not controlled by Enron The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA and Enron has this through Metgas Under the TARA Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that Metgas delivers to DPC In addition Metgas has rights to increase size of terminal at its cost So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real value here Today Metgas is owned and controlled by Enron so Enron has control But in any sale of Metgas Enrons control will be lessened Under current plans to avoid debt consolidation we will reduce Enrons equity position to or less which means we are at best sharing control with someone else or maybe a group of someone elses

Review of Art and Literature Harry N Abrams New York p ill Image size x inches Sheet size x inches At the beginning of the s Matisse was starting to concentrate on th e technique of using cut pape collages to create abstract color compositions The dense smooth colors and clearcut shapes created a totally new artistic language for him It was in seeking to extend this concept that he began under the encouragement of the publisher Teriade to experiment with using t he same types of form created through stencil printing At first he used cut stencil shapes linked to lithography and then move to using the stencils with pochoir color for this removed problem of lithography diluting the col or intensity Matisses project was to create an album titled Jazz forms expressed through a brilliant highly emotional purity of vibrant color The first trials were made using lithography and it was in this connection that the Icarus composition above was issued by Teriade in Verve as a form of

Mike CT cc Jeffrey CT Greg Whalley Subject Re ClickPapercom First thanks for jumping in on this I am confident we can get it done even though it will be a fire drill We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there it was just being held or managed in four places It will all be pulled together by Monday in one place one complete document and will have about major categories with specific tasks under each category with status person responsible comments and date to be completed It will also have a complete timeline We can review that Monday and agree on its content Louise agreed to review it as well As it relates to the people you mentioned let me know how andor who you want to pull in after we agree on the control document That way we will know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them Salley Beck called she mentioned you had called her as well and we agreed that the ClickPapers back office representative would officially be Scott Earnest he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with him for months She is going to get in place people to be our Product Control Group for CP launch on July th Scott and Salley will work to source it so that we have or people trained and ready on the th to receive password applications create customer profiles on ClickPaper and start the applications through credit legal and tax and finally get out user IDs to clients We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their people unless there is some emergency Remember we are only setting up people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified We also have a help desk person starting next week I dont have his name yet but we have him and one more on the way We will create for them a brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave We walked inch by inch through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done We have a few holes but it is not that far away She is going to think about a process document for this and get back to me Monday I have a detailed EOL one and we will give it our shot this weekend Let me know what Mark Palmer says He knows we have been using Margaret We will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan and what she needs to do We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive mailing a letter that does not include temporary IDspasswords We will tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers we want to use this time to get them preregistered Besides there is no way to test a temporary IDs anyway We will send those out later as I said earlier the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area or garden as Lousie would call it by next for Friday or the following Monday That way people can surf the content and get registered On legal I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we had a detailed discussion today about the contracts what is needed and the deadline There is legal work left to do the current draft of the password application doesnt work but if Taylor can help that would be great We will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy with Bob Crane and Hal as well to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control issues associated with it Credit is fine we have been working with Bradford for months but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual posting I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and views The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all their comments by the end of next week They will also be given the complete Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to help the roll out We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday July nd for the final testing of the system Remember the th is a one Enrontomany launch with a financial market only ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section Enron is so it is simply a new distribution channel for Enrons existing financial offering Later we will build it out for physical probably sooner rather than later Finally I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop but Louise said today that is October or November It will only be manytomany if someone comes in and makes a compelling case to do so Thanks See you tomorrow GP To Greg nron cc Subject ClickPapercom Greg a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Mondays meeting I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines personnel responsibilities and key action items I think this is another good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and assignments Andrew Parsons Sr Director and superior performer is a great and very smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort You will like him and he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team even if it is for a couple of weeks He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform He has others on his team that could help and Ive asked him to think about his existing AA resources that are available some are working on ClickPaper already Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the short run Beth Pearlman John Tollefson IT Bob Schultz LK said she could spare him without delaying phase roll out Dave Forester not a good option because it would definitely set back phase roll out Mary Solmenson Scott Mills Berry Pearce David Port David Sweeny Sally Beck advice and discuss additional resources I did ask Louise to jump in and i know you did too to help on some quick thoughts on process and lessons learned I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they or the simplified early versions are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper I went by to see Mark Palmer he was out and left him a voice mail on the marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing I wanted him to make sure that he understood the importance and priority of this effort I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out or assigning John Tollefson and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday afternoon Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to add a trading perspective A few thoughts see you tomorrow mike

emphasized during my recent trips to South America Japan and Korea Overall the trips were definitely worth the effort and each business unit n ow truly gets the ENW story and what we are attempting to accomplish The efforts over the past months are really beginning to pay dividends This is not meant to be a complete laundry list of all the important issues and discussed topics but rather a briefing of a few top priorities and items fo r each group Enron South America I met with the entire management team as a group in Rio at an ESA board meeting and most of the key individuals separately Sugar coffee and orange juice were new commodities that were brought up by numerous groups as consideration for new ENW efforts due to their desirable market characteristics Pulp and Paper additional activity has already begun and is currently bei ng worked with Greg Piper I believe that this is the best and shortterm opportunity out there Metals and mining is big in South America This was also brought up frequently and I told DArcy Carroll that we would get back to them upon further closure of MG and that this could move quickly up the food chain bu t not to focus as top priority yet DArcy former Cargill trader has strong connections at Cargill and believes that we can go in compete and capture their markets He also has several candidates and resumes which have been sent to Robert Jones for consideration for trading positions for our new agriculture trading activities Greg I will forward to you also I dont believe I sent them to you DArcy and Steve Nagy are putting together more of a business plan for the rest of with regard to commercial opportunities I have been pleased to date with Steve and his initial functions as a technology origination role but it is time to put some tangible goals and results on the table Dan Bruce VP international infrastructure is going to focus more time o n ESA Philippe and I are in the process of finalizing Regional VPs and focusing Dan to this region this is not finalized yet They need serious help in their trading systems and more senior support overall Will wait until decision made on Project California Enron Japan Joe is building an impressive team and he has a thorough and well thought o ut business plan Japan has the opportunity to be really big another Enron Europe and we have an excellent opportunity to get it right from the star t and drive this market He is in a unique position to develop a huge busine ss and drive it with technology without having the burden of a large legacy problem I think they look more like an Enron Net Works type of business than most the other business units Enron Japan needs to use the internet to educate and drive this new business to achieve the penetration it needs without an incumbent position The competition and market characteristics fit very well with our statements about ENW in our general presentations Anthony Dayeo has just joined the team Between ENW providing a VP of Anthonys caliber and our other time commitments we are really helping thi s business Initial technology focus will be internet and website driven Coordinati ng with Steve Kean to take a fresh approach to knocking down regulatory barrie rs John Sherriff is managing this business from a commodity point of view an d I think our groups working together will make this a high return future business Human capital is a key constraint issue and we went through priorities an d prioritized for greater effectiveness The group is thinking about using technology the internet and eCommerce every day Enron Korea SK Enron The activities and business plans were much better than I had expected I asked them to go through and discuss their eBusiness plan and it was quite thorough They have completed initial evaluation of EOL applications for the regio n hard copy attached KWeather is already introducing weather derivatives in Korea best shortterm oppt Definite metals opportunity here MG office exists I didnt visit the M G office SKEnron has several assets that can be leveraged into an internet play with very little expense Our technology efforts are paying dividends Inja Chug Sr Director was dedicated here a few months ago Her impact is significant and will great ly assist in IPO eCommerce ENW will be an enormous impact in increasing the value of SKEnron when they IPO next year The internet and eCommercetechnology changes should be able to significantly increase their multiple and provide Enron with a profitable exit option First mover advantage here definitel y has a winnertakeall oppt SKEnron will be the first utility in Korea to offer customers online billing and payment and other related services under development and looki ng for package solution SK currently has million customers that are not being tapped at all Interesting oppt with alliance partners AOL The SKEnron changes and opportunities that are underway are a great example of Enrons ENW ability to change from an old to new economy business A second round eBusiness plan is coming and we can evaluate as a group Excellent executive meeting and dinner with Tony Chey Owner and Chairman of SK SK is a billion company and Tony is the th richest and most powerful person in Korea I went through EnronOnline and our thoughts on t he future of the internet This was very helpful with future events with SK We are definitely setting up a network of eBusiness opportunities within Enron Jeff the commercial opportunities and accountabilities that have begun via the creation of the technology origination activities is really just beginning to gain momentum I am currently driving them via my direct involvement via videoconferences Allan Summor and I are in the process of solidifying a process for driving evaluating and monitoring all of the oth er business units more commercial technology activities When we get this to the next step lets discuss and we can get both of us on the same page as to the best way to coordinate all these efforts Please dont hestitate to call me if you want to discuss anything in more detail

family spent Saturday night throwing up I am writing this from my bed and I am improving I should be able to get on the plane tomorrow and am about to eat lunch st meal since Sat but I think it will be fine Im definitely in recovery mode I am having everything messengered out to my house later this afternoon but am concerned about contacts and getting to the hotel I know you have said that it is easy to take the train and the bus but I am concerned about it especially if i am still a little under the weather I still dont want to have a car but would you please set up someone on your staff to meet me at the gate and escort me through the process Sorry if it is a pain but I think I might need it and it will make me feel much more comfortable on the flight over knowing that I will have assistance Thanks for your help and Ill see you soon Mike McConnell Joseph P NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Mike CT cc Tokyo AdminENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Japan trip Mike Also looking forward to seeing you See comments to your questions below Joe Mike CT AM To Joseph P HirlENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Cathy CT Subject Re Japan trip Joe Thanks for the email I am looking forward to the trip and learning more about what you are doing thus how we can help If we would have had any idea that Europe could have been as big as it has become we would have done some things differently and we can get a head start with Japan This would be most helpful We are clearly trying to avoid the traps that we ran into in Europe and in the US Faster quicker smarter Thursday sounds great and just let me know about Friday Is Anthony in japan during the trip Anthony was here last week and will be back the week after you arrive Remember I am not a technologist and therefore cant discuss technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and opportunities We clearly want your business insight wrt the setup and focus of the business I will send you a presentation that we recently gave to Sherriff It is mostly up to date although continually changing This will help give you a feeling for what the landscape looks like On Wed however I would like to take you through our web presentation and how this fits into our overall strategy A couple of other questions about the trip Do you want me to make any presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans I dont think presentations are necessary unless you would feel more comfortable or have something particularly appropriate The discussion with EPowerEJ on Thursday afternoon would be good if you could speak about Net Works and what Enron is doing across the focus areas On Friday I believe that in the proposed meeting with Softbank a presentation is not necessary For the ACCJ if you had a couple of slides on Enron and our ecomm initiatives this would be great We could put this together here if you would like as I have a couple of your recent presentations Let me know Also what is the appropriate dress code The Japanese still dress up Im afraid suits are de rigour I am assuming suits but i didnt want to make any assumptions about new cultures Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about the dos and donts of both cultures We could try and find something but I think you will find that the Japanese are trying to become more western Despite what you have heard this place is not as foreign as rumored Do I have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport All of us get back and forth on the train and the bus We can get you a driver but you wont get here any faster and is quite expensive US one way I normally get a driver I am uncomfortable in new countries that I cant speak any of the language If there is a way to get lost Ill find a way One more item could you please have your assistant set up a message for me at the hotel I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it really helps Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel after the trip I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the Japanese culture Ono will set something set up here The hotel has its own massage service that can be accessed at almost all hours

Mike CT cc Jeffrey CT Greg Whalley Subject Re ClickPapercom First thanks for jumping in on this I am confident we can get it done even though it will be a fire drill We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there it was just being held or managed in four places It will all be pulled together by Monday in one place one complete document and will have about major categories with specific tasks under each category with status person responsible comments and date to be completed It will also have a complete timeline We can review that Monday and agree on its content Louise agreed to review it as well As it relates to the people you mentioned let me know how andor who you want to pull in after we agree on the control document That way we will know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them Salley Beck called she mentioned you had called her as well and we agreed that the ClickPapers back office representative would officially be Scott Earnest he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with him for months She is going to get in place people to be our Product Control Group for CP launch on July th Scott and Salley will work to source it so that we have or people trained and ready on the th to receive password applications create customer profiles on ClickPaper and start the applications through credit legal and tax and finally get out user IDs to clients We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their people unless there is some emergency Remember we are only setting up people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified We also have a help desk person starting next week I dont have his name yet but we have him and one more on the way We will create for them a brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave We walked inch by inch through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done We have a few holes but it is not that far away She is going to think about a process document for this and get back to me Monday I have a detailed EOL one and we will give it our shot this weekend Let me know what Mark Palmer says He knows we have been using Margaret We will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan and what she needs to do We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive mailing a letter that does not include temporary IDspasswords We will tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers we want to use this time to get them preregistered Besides there is no way to test a temporary IDs anyway We will send those out later as I said earlier the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area or garden as Lousie would call it by next for Friday or the following Monday That way people can surf the content and get registered On legal I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we had a detailed discussion today about the contracts what is needed and the deadline There is legal work left to do the current draft of the password application doesnt work but if Taylor can help that would be great We will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy with Bob Crane and Hal as well to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control issues associated with it Credit is fine we have been working with Bradford for months but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual posting I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and views The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all their comments by the end of next week They will also be given the complete Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to help the roll out We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday July nd for the final testing of the system Remember the th is a one Enrontomany launch with a financial market only ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section Enron is so it is simply a new distribution channel for Enrons existing financial offering Later we will build it out for physical probably sooner rather than later Finally I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop but Louise said today that is October or November It will only be manytomany if someone comes in and makes a compelling case to do so Thanks See you tomorrow GP To Greg nron cc Subject ClickPapercom Greg a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Mondays meeting I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines personnel responsibilities and key action items I think this is another good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and assignments Andrew Parsons Sr Director and superior performer is a great and very smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort You will like him and he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team even if it is for a couple of weeks He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform He has others on his team that could help and Ive asked him to think about his existing AA resources that are available some are working on ClickPaper already Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the short run Beth Pearlman John Tollefson IT Bob Schultz LK said she could spare him without delaying phase roll out Dave Forester not a good option because it would definitely set back phase roll out Mary Solmenson Scott Mills Berry Pearce David Port David Sweeny Sally Beck advice and discuss additional resources I did ask Louise to jump in and i know you did too to help on some quick thoughts on process and lessons learned I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they or the simplified early versions are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper I went by to see Mark Palmer he was out and left him a voice mail on the marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing I wanted him to make sure that he understood the importance and priority of this effort I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out or assigning John Tollefson and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday afternoon Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to add a trading perspective A few thoughts see you tomorrow mike

Greg nron cc Subject ClickPapercom Greg a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Mondays meeting I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines personnel responsibilities and key action items I think this is another good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and assignments Andrew Parsons Sr Director and superior performer is a great and very smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort You will like him and he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team even if it is for a couple of weeks He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform He has others on his team that could help and Ive asked him to think about his existing AA resources that are available some are working on ClickPaper already Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the short run Beth Pearlman John Tollefson IT Bob Schultz LK said she could spare him without delaying phase roll out Dave Forester not a good option because it would definitely set back phase roll out Mary Solmenson Scott Mills Berry Pearce David Port David Sweeny Sally Beck advice and discuss additional resources I did ask Louise to jump in and i know you did too to help on some quick thoughts on process and lessons learned I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they or the simplified early versions are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper I went by to see Mark Palmer he was out and left him a voice mail on the marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing I wanted him to make sure that he understood the importance and priority of this effort I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out or assigning John Tollefson and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday afternoon Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to add a trading perspective A few thoughts see you tomorrow

emphasized during my recent trips to South America Japan and Korea Overall the trips were definitely worth the effort and each business unit n ow truly gets the ENW story and what we are attempting to accomplish The efforts over the past months are really beginning to pay dividends This is not meant to be a complete laundry list of all the important issues and discussed topics but rather a briefing of a few top priorities and items fo r each group Enron South America I met with the entire management team as a group in Rio at an ESA board meeting and most of the key individuals separately Sugar coffee and orange juice were new commodities that were brought up by numerous groups as consideration for new ENW efforts due to their desirable market characteristics Pulp and Paper additional activity has already begun and is currently bei ng worked with Greg Piper I believe that this is the best and shortterm opportunity out there Metals and mining is big in South America This was also brought up frequently and I told DArcy Carroll that we would get back to them upon further closure of MG and that this could move quickly up the food chain bu t not to focus as top priority yet DArcy former Cargill trader has strong connections at Cargill and believes that we can go in compete and capture their markets He also has several candidates and resumes which have been sent to Robert Jones for consideration for trading positions for our new agriculture trading activities Greg I will forward to you also I dont believe I sent them to you DArcy and Steve Nagy are putting together more of a business plan for the rest of with regard to commercial opportunities I have been pleased to date with Steve and his initial functions as a technology origination role but it is time to put some tangible goals and results on the table Dan Bruce VP international infrastructure is going to focus more time o n ESA Philippe and I are in the process of finalizing Regional VPs and focusing Dan to this region this is not finalized yet They need serious help in their trading systems and more senior support overall Will wait until decision made on Project California Enron Japan Joe is building an impressive team and he has a thorough and well thought o ut business plan Japan has the opportunity to be really big another Enron Europe and we have an excellent opportunity to get it right from the star t and drive this market He is in a unique position to develop a huge busine ss and drive it with technology without having the burden of a large legacy problem I think they look more like an Enron Net Works type of business than most the other business units Enron Japan needs to use the internet to educate and drive this new business to achieve the penetration it needs without an incumbent position The competition and market characteristics fit very well with our statements about ENW in our general presentations Anthony Dayeo has just joined the team Between ENW providing a VP of Anthonys caliber and our other time commitments we are really helping thi s business Initial technology focus will be internet and website driven Coordinati ng with Steve Kean to take a fresh approach to knocking down regulatory barrie rs John Sherriff is managing this business from a commodity point of view an d I think our groups working together will make this a high return future business Human capital is a key constraint issue and we went through priorities an d prioritized for greater effectiveness The group is thinking about using technology the internet and eCommerce every day Enron Korea SK Enron The activities and business plans were much better than I had expected I asked them to go through and discuss their eBusiness plan and it was quite thorough They have completed initial evaluation of EOL applications for the regio n hard copy attached KWeather is already introducing weather derivatives in Korea best shortterm oppt Definite metals opportunity here MG office exists I didnt visit the M G office SKEnron has several assets that can be leveraged into an internet play with very little expense Our technology efforts are paying dividends Inja Chug Sr Director was dedicated here a few months ago Her impact is significant and will great ly assist in IPO eCommerce ENW will be an enormous impact in increasing the value of SKEnron when they IPO next year The internet and eCommercetechnology changes should be able to significantly increase their multiple and provide Enron with a profitable exit option First mover advantage here definitel y has a winnertakeall oppt SKEnron will be the first utility in Korea to offer customers online billing and payment and other related services under development and looki ng for package solution SK currently has million customers that are not being tapped at all Interesting oppt with alliance partners AOL The SKEnron changes and opportunities that are underway are a great example of Enrons ENW ability to change from an old to new economy business A second round eBusiness plan is coming and we can evaluate as a group Excellent executive meeting and dinner with Tony Chey Owner and Chairman of SK SK is a billion company and Tony is the th richest and most powerful person in Korea I went through EnronOnline and our thoughts on t he future of the internet This was very helpful with future events with SK We are definitely setting up a network of eBusiness opportunities within Enron Jeff the commercial opportunities and accountabilities that have begun via the creation of the technology origination activities is really just beginning to gain momentum I am currently driving them via my direct involvement via videoconferences Allan Summor and I are in the process of solidifying a process for driving evaluating and monitoring all of the oth er business units more commercial technology activities When we get this to the next step lets discuss and we can get both of us on the same page as to the best way to coordinate all these efforts Please dont hestitate to call me if you want to discuss anything in more detail

spent Saturday night throwing up I am writing this from my bed and I am improving I should be able to get on the plane tomorrow and am about to eat lunch st meal since Sat but I think it will be fine Im definitely in recovery mode I am having everything messengered out to my house later this afternoon but am concerned about contacts and getting to the hotel I know you have said that it is easy to take the train and the bus but I am concerned about it especially if i am still a little under the weather I still dont want to have a car but would you please set up someone on your staff to meet me at the gate and escort me through the process Sorry if it is a pain but I think I might need it and it will make me feel much more comfortable on the flight over knowing that I will have assistance

comments to your questions below Joe Mike CT AM To Joseph P HirlENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Cathy CT Subject Re Japan trip Joe Thanks for the email I am looking forward to the trip and learning more about what you are doing thus how we can help If we would have had any idea that Europe could have been as big as it has become we would have done some things differently and we can get a head start with Japan This would be most helpful We are clearly trying to avoid the traps that we ran into in Europe and in the US Faster quicker smarter Thursday sounds great and just let me know about Friday Is Anthony in japan during the trip Anthony was here last week and will be back the week after you arrive Remember I am not a technologist and therefore cant discuss technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and opportunities We clearly want your business insight wrt the setup and focus of the business I will send you a presentation that we recently gave to Sherriff It is mostly up to date although continually changing This will help give you a feeling for what the landscape looks like On Wed however I would like to take you through our web presentation and how this fits into our overall strategy A couple of other questions about the trip Do you want me to make any presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans I dont think presentations are necessary unless you would feel more comfortable or have something particularly appropriate The discussion with EPowerEJ on Thursday afternoon would be good if you could speak about Net Works and what Enron is doing across the focus areas On Friday I believe that in the proposed meeting with Softbank a presentation is not necessary For the ACCJ if you had a couple of slides on Enron and our ecomm initiatives this would be great We could put this together here if you would like as I have a couple of your recent presentations Let me know Also what is the appropriate dress code The Japanese still dress up Im afraid suits are de rigour I am assuming suits but i didnt want to make any assumptions about new cultures Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about the dos and donts of both cultures We could try and find something but I think you will find that the Japanese are trying to become more western Despite what you have heard this place is not as foreign as rumored Do I have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport All of us get back and forth on the train and the bus We can get you a driver but you wont get here any faster and is quite expensive US one way I normally get a driver I am uncomfortable in new countries that I cant speak any of the language If there is a way to get lost Ill find a way One more item could you please have your assistant set up a message for me at the hotel I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it really helps Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel after the trip I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the Japanese culture Ono will set something set up here The hotel has its own massage service that can be accessed at almost all hours

supplies for North America ran short as demand rose from colder weather higher electricity demand and shortages in storage from the previous year More and more supply is shifting from the US Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico has proven disappointing US demand for power generation is expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of siphoning off gas that would have been destined for storage Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the s drilling rigs and experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred The current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near full capacity at just over rigs so the industry is constrained on how quickly it can recover The US has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the s and early s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas in years Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from North Africa Algeria These terminals are capable of supplying up to of total US gas consumption about one trillion cubic feet per year Plans are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of however more are needed Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived to be unsightly or dangerous Now El Paso a company that was burned by Congress in the s by the ruling that takeorpay LNG contracts with Algeria were invalid is challenging conventional wisdom They have announced plans for six new terminals to be built in North America three in the United States and three in Mexico New LNG plants in Venezuela Algeria and Northern Australia might supply these terminals Other companies such as Enron and AEC have announced plans to build terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production IPP plants ranging from to megawatts Moreover LNG facilities on Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via undersea pipeline and cable Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and community concern The June conference entitled LNGs Role in North American Caribbean Gas Supply will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas supply shortages how long they are expected to last and what source of natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand The conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG including the capacities and timing of current terminals the prospects for new mainland and offshore terminals and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the Caribbean including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to the United States

STIRMAN MEDIATOR CLIFFORD L PARMLEY MD JD OF COUNSEL JOSEPH T KENNEDY ERIC R HIRD KEVIN T SHEA TELEPHONE FAX February Via email Mr Mrs Mike McConnell Belhaven Drive Houston TX RE Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction Co Inc as Seller and Mike and Chris McConnell as Buyer Dear Mike We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract and your letter to us regarding same dated February We want to respond to the questions and issues raised in your letter as well as make some suggestions and comments about the proposed Contract itself First the Contract being used is the standard type of Contract used for the proposed transaction The Contract is promulgated by the Texas Real Estate Commission and is to be used by all licensed Real Estate Brokers and Agents We are interested in knowing however if the Contract was filled out by Mr Larry Williams of Prudential Gary Greene Realtors If so does Mr Williams represent you or Flair Construction Co Inc Please advise us accordingly As we discussed we think it is most important that you have the opportunity to read and review the Construction Agreement that Flair Construction Co Inc intends on using for the construction of your home The fact that Flair is both the Developer as well as the potential Builder raises some issues Usually Builders have agreements with the Developer regarding the purchase of lots and building on same Often lots are reserved to certain Builders and if you purchase those lots you are required to use the designated Builders However often lots are free to be purchased by potential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want We are interested in knowing if the lots you are purchasing are actually reserved to Flair Construction Co Inc or is Flair just requiring you to use them to build your home since they are selling you the lots in question As you point out in your letter if you sign the Contract as it now reads you are captive to the Builder and are not free to negotiate with other Builders It appears to us that you will be one of the first homeowners in this new subdivision We think it is critically important that you get a copy of the Deed Restrictions even before you sign the Contract to make sure that there are restrictions in place regarding the size of homes to be built size of lots etc We want to make sure that your home is not horribly atypical for the neighborhood We do not know if The Lakes of Sterling Gate Estates is in the City of Houston or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction This is something you may want to find out as soon as possible If it is outside the city limits is there already a MUD district in place to provide water and sewer services Since this is a brand new subdivision your concern regarding its future development and tax rate is very legitimate Usually until the subdivision is fairly well built out the Developer controls the Community Association as well as the Architectural Control Committee Therefore if this subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of the Developer We recommend in the strongest terms possible that you talk with recent customers of Flair Construction Co Inc to make sure that they were happy with the construction of their homes as well as warranty work Some Builders are far better than others as it relates to followup warranty work after their customers move into their homes We normally recommend that homeowners do not move into their homes until all punch list items are completed to the satisfaction of the homeowner The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract We will now make more specific comments and suggestions in chronological order regarding the Contract Paragraph PROPERTY As we previously stated we think it is important that you acquire copies of the Restrictive Covenants and Deed Restrictions as soon as possible You will be responsible to pay assessments to the Property Owners Association Since Flair is both the Builder and Developer you may want to ask Mr Kent for an estimate of what your Community Association Fees will be Paragraph EARNEST MONEY We suggest that the earnest money be paid to the Title Company and not to Flair Construction Co Inc Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY The standard printed exception as to discrepancies conflicts shortages in area or boundary lines encroachments or protrusions or overlapping improvements is in your Owners Policy In other words the title policy does not cover these types of discrepancies or conflicts However if a survey is completed and an additional fifteen percent of the policy premium is paid the title company will probably delete this exception This is something you may want to consider However this cost would be yours to incur If however it is subsequently discovered that there are such discrepancies and conflicts or shortages then you will have title insurance coverage accordingly Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY last paragraph Make sure you are provided a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance as soon as possible Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY B It appears to us that the only survey you will be provided with by the Seller is one for the new recorded plat of the subdivision Therefore the Seller is not providing you a survey of your actual lots If you were to have the standard printed exception as to discrepancies and conflicts deleted we believe you would need a survey of your lots You will have seven days after you receive the Commitment andor the survey to object in writing to any matters disclosed or you will be deemed to waive such objections accordingly Therefore please make sure that we have the opportunity to review the survey and commitment as soon as possible after you receive same Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY We agree that this paragraph relating to the Sellers right to continue to show the property for sale should be deleted Paragraph PROPERTY CONDITION B We suggest that this paragraph be checked and utilized rather than paragraph B which states that you will be accepting the property in its present condition Paragraph B states that you will pay a fee usually very small like for the unrestricted right to terminate the contract in the event the property is not suitable for the purposes for which you intend on using it In other words you can have whatever inspectors you deem necessary to look at the property to make sure that it is satisfactory for your home construction We often suggest that an independent inspector be hired by the homeowner to inspect and review the construction of the home as it progresses In addition there may be some environmental issues or soil condition questions that an inspector might raise if given the opportunity As the Contract now reads you are simply accepting the property as is and have no right to send an inspector out to the property accordingly Paragraph BROKERS FEES You may want an affirmative statement that you as the Buyer will not be responsible for or pay any Brokers fees Paragraph SPECIAL PROVISIONS It is written in that the closing on these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March whichever is later However we do not know what roads are being addressed and think that this sentence needs far more specificity The second sentence regarding your obligation to use Flair Homes has already been addressed earlier The third sentence regarding when construction must start should be revised to give you more time as you make reference in your letter However we also suggest that the Builder be put under an obligation to start construction within thirty days after the date you notify him that you are ready for construction to begin Paragraph

BergsiekerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Mike CT Subject Oxy meeting We just finished the meeting with Dale Laurance and Casey Olson Heres a recap Oxy wanted to meet with Mike for two reasons Make sure Enron and Oxy had a project team in place asap and the resources are committed to do a world class job on the January submission and subsequent presentations As Mike noted we are in sudden death overtime and the th could be the end of the tournament Revisit the street talk about Enron redeploying capital Mike walked through the EGM organization talked about our stock multiple and how an announcement that we were putting huge dollars in Saudi would hurt our stock price Dale talked about their low multiple between and noted that the market viewed Oxy as a company that could do deals buy and sell assets but really wasnt a growth company They now have a stable cash flow but need a new beach head in the Middle East to demonstrate they are growing The point of this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being dumped into Saudi Arabia They characterized the Saudi perspective as being one where they are looking for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital They agree on a division of labor Oxy can do EP processing and petrochemicals and look to us for pipelines and power plants although Oxy can do those too They realize that only Enron has the marketing structuring and regulatory expertise Casey did revisit his conversation with you about in the end Enron ends up as some type of merchant banker Thats OK in the end Dale even said they would take over our part of any project but we cant project that role initially We need to be on the same side of the table as Oxy The point here is that we have to be in step with a consistent approach to the projects They expect our competitors to say theyll finance things on balance sheet and we need initially to say the same thing although later we will open discussions on other ways to finance Mike and I agree that this is probably the biggest sticking point in the discussion today Oxy believes that such an initial statement will never be public and we arent really locked in an onbalance sheet approach Maybe we can do this maybe we cant They see this as a year long process with PDAs stretching well into next year and when the real money would be spent The short term crisis is January and we need a submission with lots of pages we were criticized that although our proposal was well thought through and technically superb it didnt have enough pages reams of paper to impress the technocrats We will also need to prepare a smaller page digest to be used for our official February presentation and a three page walk around summary Casey thinks the production center has to be in the US We also all agreed that the Jan questions allow us to lay out all of our downstream concerns and establish a placeholder for issues that must be resolved during the PDA discussions before we would do a project I have had the greatest success around the world when we dont try to force immediately on a country a perfect gas or electric market but adapt to local conditions and implement the most important first couple of steps with the rest to follow later In this respect our projects can include suggested regulatory concepts that if successful can be used elsewhere in the Kingdom Over and over we came back to the project team which they want on the ground in Saudi Casey will be Saudi for the foreseeable future and can make all decisions Who will be our lead person with the same authority They dont want to deal with someone who later says Houston changed its mind a little arrogant When can we identify bodies and assignments and location They want full time dedicated people Either Dale or Casey noted that the old Enron would have parachuted a team in by now Like South America where we landed in a swamp and spent the next five years beating alligators over the head with a stick This is a very complicated political and technical effort The leader has to be good at both Casey was excited that Rob would be assigned to the project I guess you discussed this with him They both were quick to say that the working relationship to date has been excellent and that they appreciate the effort we have put into this Mike committed that we would go balls to the wall for the th deadline I committed that I would designate a project team by the first week in January we had our first conference call yesterday but Mike said he wanted to think about the decision point person and process we arent about to sacrifice a deliberative strategicconsensus thought process because they are in a hurry We spent a lot of time talking about the process We agree that the Saudis will eliminate one or two participants that each project will have subparts with different combinations and leads of companies with a master JV on top They minimized the capital investment although they are prepared to spent million over the next years They see core project costing million OxyEnron assuming one other partner and Enron half of that We arent talking billions spoken like a true major They are sure Exxon Mobil will be our Red Sea partner if only to earn face with possibly Marathon as the other Exxon is more interested in the chemical focus which Oxy will concede to them Mike noted was that our worst nightmare was a partner Exxon who would throw away money just to have a presence We were assured that Oxys only goal was to make money and if he projects didnt they would walk away The real danger in the upstream is the risk money for exploration Oxy hopes to hedge this risk with downstream investments pipelines and plants and hopes that if the exploration is successful and reserves are added it will lead to a whole new series of projects They are very proud of Oxys role in this claim that they were instrumental in getting Petry Parkman and Morgan selected as advisors that Irani is the most respected American Arab business man and has great access in the Kingdom and that they already know what investments partners are acceptable to the Saudis We all left great friends in good Christmas spirit From our perspective Saudi is the largest economy in the Middle east and the driver in international oil and liquids markets Enron needs to get inside and establish relationships with the key Saudi people We need a foot print in the Kingdom with which to earn their respect Can we do it with minimal capital investment Saudi is about to embark of a complete electric and gas restructuring regulatory included They want the repatriation of petro dollars and dollars held offshore by Saudi nationals The country can be a tremendous source of capital It looks like can be managed with a minimum burn rate with the most intense period of activity being in January We need to set up the team for the January effort Ill have this done by Jan There is the question of sorting out conflicts with other ME priorities Although it may be too soon to answer we dont know yet what is possible but we can shape that outcome what is the end game what do we want out of Saudi Arabia We seem to have a clear division of labor and strategy with Oxy although we need to sort out what we say about on balance sheet financing We also need to keep in mind that our other yet to be met partners will have a lot to say Oxy wants to take the lead on the Core Venture Red Sea I agree this is a perfect laboratory to address all of the market structure issues that will make the Kingdom a great place to do business Mike Im sure you can add more Rick its up to you if you want to send this around to the Saudi team Merry Christmas

NRONDEVELOPMENt Eric CT cc Subject Re Jose LNG Crude Pricing Per a conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the Houston office the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent on a year deal is NOT a possibility If we had of our GSA price linked to Brent our exposure for years would be about million barrels notional or about million barrels PV At our exposure would still be million notional or million PV According to John he would not be comfortable doing anything past and even out that far he would not consider doing more than about million PV barrels in the years Given these comments I would say that the size of our deal basically precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time As far as the economics of the deal are concerned we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to figure out our economics I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see if we could get a year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that the hedging costs would be too high and therefore have left it at that for the time being Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue Thanks Eric Guido NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Eric CT cc Emilio VicensENRON NRON CT Larry CT Cris CT Brent A CT Eric CT Daniel R RogersENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Jose LNG Offtake Comments Eric thanks for your comments Please see below in blue our observations and answers Lets talk later today if you have further questions Saludos Guido and Emilio Enron Offtake Agreement Section Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the EPC agreement Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers In addition it preserves your year offtake which should still match your GSA The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen that being the earlier of months after Financial Close or NTP or Dec We will add to this list the earlier of something like the date on which the plant has produced LNG at at least of its capacity for a period of consecutive days We suggest putting something like this as opposed to commercial hand over because this is in the plantscontractors control and they could for example on purpose not meet a noise level requirement for months for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project but we as offtakers can not wait for ever for the project to be completed with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow directly or indirectly under the projects control We have months limits to how much the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC or another EPC Contractor already built in Section I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of We agree that would be better but we included this section knowing that is something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA because they dont want us to sell down and then keep controlling new LNG businesses in Jose They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA We think that adding a restriction to the assets returns now in the draft will make it very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause Thus jeopardizing our chance to control the output of future plants or expansions We never intended to use these offtake agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes Nevertheless we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial control of the output Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will clearly realize what our intent is Section Where is the bonus calculation We did not include it now on purpose We will include it when ever they remind us to do so We want to have another fight about the bonus Where is the min price The minimum price is in We say that one of the terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number We are going to try to do it but that is first a GSA issue and we dont want to put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA We precisely bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we want to make it zero Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics No we dont have the definitive answer from structuring yet but our guess and based on our meeting with RAC the other day in which they told us about the mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba Brazil power plant we are pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not convenient But since we dont have a definitive answer yet we still included oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting that should have been bracketed in the termsheet though and it will Section you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate Is this your intent to have a mismatch Yes we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as offtaker and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if they do you have all new taxes being borne by the project company Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized See section of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue The exporter of record will be the project so the buyer has no business in Venezuela other than paying port fees We do not see any kind of taxes that could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred to the project Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that projects typically take all the time the heavy crude projects are some examples in Venezuela In addition the GSA provides for a number of reliefs for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel safer Although a large portion of the underlying risk is always there Other where are the LD calculations explained I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default GSA default should match LDs in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better New York law provides for full market based damages market price of commodity plus extra costs which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD clause So from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it as it is We are still discussing w Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is sellable to AA for MTM but our initial view is that it should be since the level of LD can not be better GSA default is market based provided that PDVSA as we expect accepts the change we will propose so the Project Company will be able to pay market based damages For interruption of gas supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being relieved from performance in such event this will obviously be to a maximum dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time say months we need time to give you precision on this but some sort of coverage will be available suppose the plant produces less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems not a FM issue at commercial hand over What happens under the offtake agreements Will the banks accept this revenue short fall Will we have to create a reserve This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry Under the offtake agreements the project pays market based damages if it does not meet the contracted volume We believe that the contracted volume that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks and equity holders to bear the risk We are contracting for contractually guaranteed production under the EPC which is lower than expected On top of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible meaning a lower LNG volume This volume is lower than the guaranteed production with Normal or expected feed composition Combining these two we have a contracted quantity that is lower than the expected production with expected feed On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least above what was expected mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs Also the EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equityholders whole They dont provide though for damages payable under offtake contracts nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs However as we explained we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co Banks will most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption as we already did What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is resolved what compensation do the offtakers get do the banks suffer here as well The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to determine failure to deliver by Seller It also establishes that deliveries should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant The bottom line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of defaults and price differentials It sets however a reasonable standard by which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur based on the reasonable constant deliveries provision damages will be payable based on prices during such month Yes banks suffer here to the extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable Nevertheless short periods weeks of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect the Project Company ability to pay the Banks It will have to be some prolonged period for Banks to be affected Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first days Will the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established Is this in your model We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard although we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected Our model assumes the cost of an LC for month debt service which should be plenty The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather damages not BI are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not permitted for MTM reasons The question that follows is if damages exceed the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its obligation to deliver have the damages have to be senior to debt payments for AA to allow MTM to be permitted If this is so are the banks going to be willing to live with this probably not insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling It is briefly covered in section second paragraph This will be expended in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to PDVSA insert termination section In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an offtaker than an asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law than if we try to right an early termination clause They point out also that of LNG contracts are done in this way having NY law rule the game They point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements for financing requirements We will Eric CT AM To Guido CarantiENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Emilio VicensENRON NRONDEVELOPMENt cc Larry nron Cris CT Brent A CT Eric CT Daniel R RogersENRON

Re Jose LNG Crude Pricing Per a conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the Houston office the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent on a year deal is NOT a possibility If we had of our GSA price linked to Brent our exposure for years would be about million barrels notional or about million barrels PV At our exposure would still be million notional or million PV According to John he would not be comfortable doing anything past and even out that far he would not consider doing more than about million PV barrels in the years Given these comments I would say that the size of our deal basically precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time As far as the economics of the deal are concerned we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to figure out our economics I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see if we could get a year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that the hedging costs would be too high and therefore have left it at that for the time being Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue Thanks Eric Guido NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Eric CT cc Emilio VicensENRON NRON CT Larry CT Cris CT Brent A CT Eric CT Daniel R RogersENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Jose LNG Offtake Comments Eric thanks for your comments Please see below in blue our observations and answers Lets talk later today if you have further questions Saludos Guido and Emilio Enron Offtake Agreement Section Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the EPC agreement Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers In addition it preserves your year offtake which should still match your GSA The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen that being the earlier of months after Financial Close or NTP or Dec We will add to this list the earlier of something like the date on which the plant has produced LNG at at least of its capacity for a period of consecutive days We suggest putting something like this as opposed to commercial hand over because this is in the plantscontractors control and they could for example on purpose not meet a noise level requirement for months for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project but we as offtakers can not wait for ever for the project to be completed with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow directly or indirectly under the projects control We have months limits to how much the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC or another EPC Contractor already built in Section I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of We agree that would be better but we included this section knowing that is something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA because they dont want us to sell down and then keep controlling new LNG businesses in Jose They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA We think that adding a restriction to the assets returns now in the draft will make it very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause Thus jeopardizing our chance to control the output of future plants or expansions We never intended to use these offtake agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes Nevertheless we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial control of the output Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will clearly realize what our intent is Section Where is the bonus calculation We did not include it now on purpose We will include it when ever they remind us to do so We want to have another fight about the bonus Where is the min price The minimum price is in We say that one of the terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number We are going to try to do it but that is first a GSA issue and we dont want to put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA We precisely bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we want to make it zero Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics No we dont have the definitive answer from structuring yet but our guess and based on our meeting with RAC the other day in which they told us about the mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba Brazil power plant we are pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not convenient But since we dont have a definitive answer yet we still included oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting that should have been bracketed in the termsheet though and it will Section you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate Is this your intent to have a mismatch Yes we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as offtaker and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if they do you have all new taxes being borne by the project company Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized See section of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue The exporter of record will be the project so the buyer has no business in Venezuela other than paying port fees We do not see any kind of taxes that could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred to the project Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that projects typically take all the time the heavy crude projects are some examples in Venezuela In addition the GSA provides for a number of reliefs for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel safer Although a large portion of the underlying risk is always there Other where are the LD calculations explained I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default GSA default should match LDs in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better New York law provides for full market based damages market price of commodity plus extra costs which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD clause So from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it as it is We are still discussing w Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is sellable to AA for MTM but our initial view is that it should be since the level of LD can not be better GSA default is market based provided that PDVSA as we expect accepts the change we will propose so the Project Company will be able to pay market based damages For interruption of gas supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being relieved from performance in such event this will obviously be to a maximum dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time say months we need time to give you precision on this but some sort of coverage will be available suppose the plant produces less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems not a FM issue at commercial hand over What happens under the offtake agreements Will the banks accept this revenue short fall Will we have to create a reserve This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry Under the offtake agreements the project pays market based damages if it does not meet the contracted volume We believe that the contracted volume that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks and equity holders to bear the risk We are contracting for contractually guaranteed production under the EPC which is lower than expected On top of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible meaning a lower LNG volume This volume is lower than the guaranteed production with Normal or expected feed composition Combining these two we have a contracted quantity that is lower than the expected production with expected feed On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least above what was expected mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs Also the EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equityholders whole They dont provide though for damages payable under offtake contracts nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs However as we explained we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co Banks will most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption as we already did What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is resolved what compensation do the offtakers get do the banks suffer here as well The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to determine failure to deliver by Seller It also establishes that deliveries should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant The bottom line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of defaults and price differentials It sets however a reasonable standard by which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur based on the reasonable constant deliveries provision damages will be payable based on prices during such month Yes banks suffer here to the extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable Nevertheless short periods weeks of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect the Project Company ability to pay the Banks It will have to be some prolonged period for Banks to be affected Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first days Will the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established Is this in your model We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard although we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected Our model assumes the cost of an LC for month debt service which should be plenty The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather damages not BI are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not permitted for MTM reasons The question that follows is if damages exceed the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its obligation to deliver have the damages have to be senior to debt payments for AA to allow MTM to be permitted If this is so are the banks going to be willing to live with this probably not insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling It is briefly covered in section second paragraph This will be expended in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to PDVSA insert termination section In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an offtaker than an asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law than if we try to right an early termination clause They point out also that of LNG contracts are done in this way having NY law rule the game They point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct

Katy CT Vance NRON John AmblerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Juiced ComputerWorld Juiced By Julia King and Gary H Anthes Nov Wall Street analysts and oil industry executives were thick among the legion of skeptics who thought Enron Corp President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling was nuts to launch a Web site for the trading of natural gas and electricity over the Internet That was last November before EnronOnline locked up more than billion in transactions in its first few months of operation quickly establishing itself as the worlds largest ecommerce company As of Oct just prior to Enrons report of its thirdquarter earnings EnronOnline had executed more than transactions representing a gross value of billion Since then the billion Houstonbased energy giant has elbowed its way into several new diversified markets And it plans to continue its push into many more ranging from railcar cargo space to broadband networking and datastorage capacity In doing so Enron is turbocharging its transformation from a stodgy oldline fuel company to an entirely new kind of businesstobusiness market maker with information technology and an allout emphasis on entrepreneurship at the heart of its New Economy operations Enron has been so successful in leveraging IT to pioneer new markets that others are trying to emulate its approach First to Market Enron often introduces a product before the competition even senses a market exists the company says in its latest annual report A prime example online trading of datanetwork capacity Indeed theres a low degree of awareness among carriers about the bandwidthtrading business and Enron is ahead of the game says Seth Libby an analyst at The Yankee Group in Boston At present there are only a handful of network professionals who are aware of these capacity commoditization plans says Libby But not for long asserts Enron President Jeff Skilling Within five years the bandwidth market may be bigger than the gas and electric markets he says So for us it could be as big as the rest of our existing energy business Thats currently a billion business But critics say trading bandwidth is much more complicated than trading gas especially for a company with little depth in telecommunications And critics add that although carriers stand to benefit from the ability to buy and sell capacity they might prefer to do it through some channel thats independent of the control of a single market maker like Enron Enrons argument is that its trading capabilities are the differentiator and that it need not have deep telecom expertise says Lisa Pierce an analyst at Giga Information Group in Stamford Conn But Im not convinced its that simple Technology isnt a longterm competitive differentiator Houstonbased Enron Broadband Services Inc formed last year offers IP transport on its mile fiberoptic network Enron Broadband Services also trades that is makes a market by buying and selling network capacity to and from other data carriers conducting some of the transactions on EnronOnline Enron Broadband Services also offers contentoriented services such as a videoondemand service it will market with Dallasbased Blockbuster Inc to home viewers starting next month When we started the gas business they told us we were nuts Skilling says They said Youre going to sell gas but not own production How does that work Then we did electricity and they said we were nuts again and even louder than before They said this stuff moves at the speed of light you can never create a market Then in telecommunications they said we were nuts again Despite its share of skeptics some experts like Enrons prospects in this space I think aspects of this have the potential to be very big says Libby The carriers like the idea of instantaneous provisioning And I think it has a lot of potential for selling it to businesses and giving them the ability to cut their costs significantly by buying it as they need it We aspire to that kind of model says Fred Buehler director of electronic business at Eastman Chemical Co in Kingsport Tenn In every sector there will be one or two innovators who get out front and do things differently to create shareholder value Buehler says Were trying to be one of them Market Maker Stroll through the gastrading section on the nd floor of Enrons glistening story headquarters and the companys technological sophistication is immediately evident Traders like yearold John Arnold who personally executes about billion per day in trades have realtime access to virtually any information that might affect their splitsecond buyandsell decisions That information might be a meteorologists prediction of a colderthannormal winter across the Plains states or a live news report of political instability in an oilproducing country in the Middle East Behind the scenes all of Arnolds trades are instantly analyzed and processed by a sophisticated proprietary riskmanagement system and then updated across multiple backend computer systems worldwide Less than a year after launching the operation of the worlds gas is traded on EnronOnline What we are doing no one in the industry did years ago Eighty percent of our income this year is from businesses that didnt exist years ago says Skilling For example EnronOnline contributed heavily to its parent companys thirdquarter earnings which were up to million compared with the same period last year The change is technologydriven Skilling adds We couldnt do what we do without massive amounts of computing capability In this regard Enron joins a short list of companies that includes WalMart Stores Inc FedEx Corp and American Airlines Inc which famously pioneered various missioncritical IT techniques to leapfrog competitors and create a whole new class of ITenabled industry leaders Among Enrons boldest ideas is its use of a single powerful softwarebased trading platform to insert itself as a principal buyer or seller in hundreds of different markets Currently Enron trades more than different commodities such as gold natural gas and metals on EnronOnline The core of our business is our business model which is a centralized riskmanagement and marketmaking business model It just so happens that the Internet is just perfect for improving the efficiency of that model Skilling says But as a market maker EnronOnline stands alone For starters unlike most other Internet marketplaces its free There are no transaction fees or catalog inventory or subscription costs for users Enron has broken away from the pack in the last year in terms of their capital growth says Ian Wylie vice president of ebusiness at BP Amoco PLC in London And ebusiness is responsible for a lot of this change Even more unusual is Enrons role as a principal in each transaction That means Enron is either the buyer or seller in every trade in which its involved unlike market makers that simply act as matchmakers between buyers and sellers In fact Skilling as well as Mike McConnell who heads EnronOnlines global expansion efforts as president and CEO of Enron Global Markets LLC dismisses much of the current hyperactivity surrounding other feebased businesstobusiness exchanges as a flash in the pan Many of the BB guys think all you have to do is set up a bulletin board and people will start transacting but it doesnt work that way Skilling says You need to know you can deliver if push comes to shove As either the seller or buyer in all of its trades Enron an established brand name with miles of pipeline and deep financial pockets guarantees delivery or payment on all trades that are executed on EnronOnline Were creating markets that were highly illiquid so someone has to put their reputation on the line to say Well deliver Skilling says But guaranteeing delivery also requires having guaranteed access to physical assets such as network bandwidth and papermaking plants Guaranteed access also ensures marketplace liquidity For Enron this is where the bricks and mortar come in For example to help drive its liquidity in the pulp and paper market Enron paid million in July for Garden State Paper Co a recyclednewsprint mill in Garfield NJ Skillings current market fancy is metals and in May Enron bought MG PLC a Londonbased metals marketer You have to break the liquidity logjam and to do that you have to take a risk position Skilling says But once the logjam is cleared Enron is just as likely to sell off the brickandmortar assets it acquired and use the cash to invest in new business For example to finance its new bandwidthtrading operation Enron is selling Portland General Electric Co a Portland Orebased power producer that it bought in so it could bring liquidity to and guarantee trades in the online electricity market Eventually Enron may end up trading commodities that arent even considered commodities at least not at the moment such as data storage capacity or empty railcar space Might we move into sauces or meats or grains Potentially says McConnell who was Enrons de facto CIO before moving into his current role You have to be creative every day McConnell says You have to be openminded to trying new things But what remains constant throughout all the upsizing and downsizing is Enrons core ITenabled business model which is what puts it in a class of its own analysts say People have talked a lot about systems that theyre about to roll out but there is just not much out there for direct trading says Mike Heim an energy analyst at AG Edwards Sons Inc in St Louis Enron rolled out its technology months ago and still there isnt much else out there There hasnt been much competition because there isnt anybody in the same class But just last month Houstonbased Dynegy Inc launched Dynegydirect an Internetbased commissionfree trading site for energy and communications commodities Also last month IntercontinentalExchange in Atlanta whose partners include BP Amoco and The Haguebased Royal DutchShell Group added natural gas and power to its online trading system which already included precious metals and crude oil Skilling doesnt get called nuts much anymore In fact hes a darling on Wall Street where Enrons stock has soared from around per share last November to as of this Nov As a result Enron by all accounts an Old Economy gas pipeline company until months ago is widely regarded as a New Economy pioneer Says Skilling We like to say we were BB before there was BB Thriving On the Unconventional As head of two Enron pipeline subsidiaries Mike McConnell knew a lot more about gas flows than he did about data flows last year when he got a surprise call from Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling Recalls McConnell Jeff went into this whole thought process about how the Internet is changing everything He said We need to make Enron an ebusiness and I need a guy that can run this as a business We need to change the way we view technology I thought he was a little crazy and I said Jeff Im not a technology person at all He said No seriously this is going to be big So I took over as CEO of Enron Global Technology and thus became the companys de facto CIO McConnell explains Appointing a person with no technology background to the top IT post is an unusual move But Enron often defies convention and typically thrives as a result Indeed Enron boasts an entrepreneurial culture thats unusual in large longestablished companies and in utilities firms in particular McConnell relates the tale of how yearold Louise Kitchen Enrons head gas trader in Europe spearheaded the creation of an online gastrading system recruiting IT people from elsewhere in the company to do the development work Word of the Webbased platform EnronOnline which is literally remaking the company didnt reach top management until a few weeks before it went live Kitchen enlisted the support of Enrons initially skeptical top traders and she scoured the company for software developers and other experts Her small army of volunteers worked nights and weekends on the project while carrying on with their regular jobs Its an amazing story about not getting corporate approval and going through all the bureaucracy McConnell says No one went to the board and said We want to change the way we trade You just do it Glowing Endorsement Soon after McConnell became the de facto CIO of the billion energy company he joined eight of Sun Microsystems Incs top Houston customers at a breakfast hosted by Sun CEO Scott McNealy I was very nervous recalls McConnell I mean McNealy is the guy and here I know nothing about technology Id been on the job maybe two weeks McNealy asked the attendees all but McConnell were middleaged CIOs with many years of IT experience to introduce themselves in turn When Scott came to me I said Im the CEO of Global Technology and we want to be the leader in BB commerce in the world He kind of sat back and said How long have you been in the IT business McConnell explains About nine days I said and we are going to take a little bit different approach to technology Scott chuckled and said That sounds like Enron it always looks at things differently He then stated that my CEO title and Enrons approach were very unusual but that it would be more commonplace soon as this was the way of the future McConnell says McNealys endorsement had a huge impact on how he structured IT at Enron during the following year I realized that we werent too late to change our approach and take a commercial view of technology he says a view of IT as an integral part of the business not as something that supports business functions None of the other companies were thinking our new way at all Taking a commercial view of IT has led to a blurring of the line that traditionally separates IT organizations from the business units they support When McConnell became CEO of Global Technology Enron had five CIOs who were predominantly operating independently inside the companys major lines of business Each CIO had his own agenda his own thought process his own goals and they did not communicate at all he says McConnell established corporate standards for IT created a management team that included the five CIOs and put all IT people under a new chief technology officer Philippe Bibi But IT is far from centralized at Enron We wanted to make people think about technology not as IT and support but as an extension of your business he explains So we seeded people out into the business units IT directs the performance review process but the business units have the greatest influence on where the person actually ranks and is rated Firms like Enron that merge IT departments with the business units they serve will be the winners among fastpaced ebusinesses says IT organization expert Robert Zawacki president of Zawacki and Associates in Colorado Springs and a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado also in Colorado Springs We need more entrepreneurial leaders in IT and McConnell is certainly one he says IT makes it easier to be entrepreneurial says McConnell who is now president and CEO of Enron Global Markets We really do like to try things and see what happens and when you have an electronic platform like EnronOnline that we can model into different sectors its very inexpensive to try it We are not afraid if its not working well just stop Gary H Anthes and Julia King

thanks for all of the support in the placement of the former CALME employees We are done to just a very few at this time It appears that your new squad is getting some traction on building the LNG business Im pleased to hear that I look forward to hearing how our transportation or logistics business is developing Perhaps we can get together sometime during the San Antonio conference to catch up All the best Shawn PS the following is an interesting article about the online intermodal landscape Hashing Out Ecommerce JOHN GALLAGHER Traffic World Page Copyright Gale Group Inc All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Journal of Commerce Inc Dotcoms explain how they hope to compete in intermodal market and among themselves With some websites devoted to transportation ecommerce companies acknowledge that its difficult for potential customers to cut through the confusion and figure out whos doing what and whos going to be with them for the long term Because of the competition between their respective railroad partners one of the bigger questions for intermodal shippers is the relationship between Arzoon and Freightwise There has been speculation that after Freightwise was established by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway four competitors Union Pacific Railroad Norfolk Southern CSX and Canadian Pacific Railway teamed up with rival ecommerce site Arzoon in a response to BNSFs proposed merger with Canadian National Railway However both Freightwise and Arzoon claim thats not the case Im continually asked Whats up with the four railroads and Arzoon said Charley Eisele UP senior vice president strategic planning People are trying to make a whole lot out of the coincidence of these two things from a timing perspective The reality is it was a decision made on the underlying business model Freightwise executives agree with that assessment pointing out that because the industry happened to be divided along merger lines at the same time the railroads were aligning with ecommerce initiatives it seemed too much of a coincidence that the same four railroads opposing the merger were the ones joining Arzoon However I think to launch a company like this takes more than just a reaction to a merger said Freightwise Chief Marketing Officer Sanjay Joshi There are major differences between the two Internet companies starting with their business plans Arzoon categorizes itself as a shippercentric transportation management system whose target market is the roughly percent of the transportation business that currently moves under contract Freightwise on the other hand classifies itself as a transportation exchange and is targeting the remaining percent of the market procured on a spot basis Arzoon whose primary focus is the shipper is setting out to help manage the relationships that already exist between shipper and carrier The priority for carrierfocused Freightwise is to make sure the capacity is there for shippers who log on to their system In addition Arzoon which currently is involved only with rail and truck wants eventually to become a transportation management system that manages across all modes and borders including ocean and air freight said Eisele Freightwise will stick to truckload and intermodal for the time being Were not sure about getting involved with air freight given the size of the market and the economics said Joshi It takes a different set of products and economics than surface transportation Maybe sometime down the line but right now we really plan on getting entrenched in the truckload and intermodal spot market We think thats a lot to chew The key is to focus on a particular footprint that we can begin to own rather than get too broad and lose focus The fact that Arzoon and Freightwise have teamed up with different rail carriers is another cause for concern Will there be a disincentive on the part of carriers to use each others ecommerce initiatives and ultimately therefore a disadvantage for prospective customers The answer is the rule said a source from an Arzoon rail partner A particular shipper is in a position where percent of their business is conducted via truck and other modes and maybe only percent via railroads If the choice presented to them is to select a system that addresses all modes effectively or one that only addresses a particular mode then the rule would suggest that greater leverage would lie in picking the broader multimode transportation management system In that case even though a railroad may have another ecommerce approach it would clearly have to respond to the customers needs in that situation Freightwises Joshi makes a similar argument Freightwise is merely another channel for BNSF to market its services he said It posts a certain set of rates for what it believes to be fair for the service Its not for Freightwise to decide what rates BNSF decides to move through its channel UP may not decide to post its rates on Freightwise Joshi said so then BNSF would have to find out whats the competitive rate relative to UP Another question arises as to whether Arzoon may have a competitive advantage over Freightwise particularly from an intermodal standpoint because it is backed by both Eastern and Western carriers whereas Freightwise is backed only by BNSF I would only say that the partnership we have with BNSF is not exclusive and that were talking to other railroads as well Joshi noted He added This is an exchange to market your capacity and services It would be very difficult for six railroads to do something on their own there would be no critical mass Its to the advantage of the other railroads to participate Along with BNSF which provides Freightwise with instant capacity the company recently signed GE Corp as an anchor tenant and equity investor that will help Freightwise reach the critical mass Joshi talks about As both a major supplier to the rail industry locomotives and a potential shipper appliances the goal is to use GE as something we can leverage and work with their respective divisions as a way to reduce their transportation costs he said Visibility is a key advantage for potential customers of both Interment companies As a transportation management system with access to all modes it allows shippers to be more efficient in the management of transportation Eisele said Crossmodal visibility means that because theyll be managing their truck business under the same system as rail the economics of rail will be much more visible And we believe that with comparable reliability the economics will be compelling to the point where rails will garner a greater share of those customers total transportation buy Joshi claims a big difference between Freightwise and other exchanges is that when a shipper is looking for transportation options between specific origindestination pairs Freightwise allows customers to make sidebyside comparisons between truck and intermodal It is this price and service transparency Joshi says that will save its customers money Were giving customers three to five choices between truck and intermodal not so that they can see service and price parameters Intermodal ecommerce ventures such as Freightwise also bring up the question of competition with traditional intermodal marketing companies Joshi points out that its fee for doing a lot of what small and midsize IMCs do currently such as load matching tracking and tracing and order processing is percent which is split between the buyer and seller of the services This compares to the to percent that customers traditionally have paid for retaining an IMC I dont think all brokers will embrace us Joshi conceded but at the same time there will be a segment of brokers who will begin migrating into higheraddedvalue services for example the thirdparty logistics side rather than the classical brokerage Theyll get into things like inventory management on behalf of shippers and leave backend processing to firms like Freightwise Webmodal which is a purely intermodal ecommerce venture whose vision is to make intermodal much more like truck in the eyes of the shipper points out that it can take customers several days to receive a bid from a traditional IMC We can immediately configure door to door intermodal solutions that we can put together using our underlying carrier relationships said Webmodal founder and CEO Chris Kravas We do business with a lot of large US railroads and with drayage companies We give everybody access to all the information they might need to make decisions on price vs service tradeoffs and which carriers make most sense based on what the shipper is trying to do And we do it without the traditional onetothreeday wait that typically happens in response to a normal request for intermodal services Kravas said the company has invested time and expertise in developing what it calls a firstever schedule engine that works door to door Traditionally the industry hasnt had a schedule engine that involves the drayplusrailplusdray services so theres been pretty much a reliance on rules of thumb But the truth is it doesnt take anywhere near eight days for most origindestination pairs We have a very robust way of representing the capabilities of the dray carriers as well as the rail carriers so that much more trucklike transit can be shown to be viable Because of this Webmodal sees itself as more of a technology and ecommerce company than a traditional IMC and considers itself more a vendor than a competitor How does a small or midsize IMC work as a customer of Webmodal Not all small IMCs are set up to do business with all of the railroads or with a large set of drayage companies Kravas said What we do for them is give them a lowcost way to access a comprehensive array of intermodal products and services available in the US Weve established ourselves as a business partner with a large base of firstrate drayage companies across the country So if youre an IMC with an opportunity to handle freight in a new market Webmodal allows you to put together a service and pay only a modest fee Kravas wouldnt disclose the companys fee structure only that it charges per shipment for a webbased order and a slightly higher fee for a phone or fax order A smaller IMC also could use Webmodal to put in place a private version of its technology that would enable the IMC to better manage its business That would range from pricing order fulfillment customer service kind of the whole spectrum of capabilities that would allow an IMC to take advantage of our system Kravas said Everyones waiting to see whos going to survive the transportation dotcom fallout Before that happens however Freightwise may find itself as big a competitor with Arzoon as it is with a company like Webmodal Were starting from different points said Freightwises Joshi but down the line yes I can see more headtohead competition between the two companies In addition to establishing itself in that percent of the market devoted to transportation contracts UPs Eisele notes that Arzoon also has a catalogcapability function which eventually can be used to auction capacity in the spot market the market in which Freightwise is establishing itself We will very much have the capability to enable spot market buying he said As Webmodals Kravas pointed out Its going to be an interesting next six months ArzoonAT Kearney partnership Consulting firm AT Kearney a unit of Dallasbased EDS and Arzoon which provides Internetbased services for managing transportation work processes worldwide have formed a strategic alliance AT Kearney was one of the first to establish a dedicated practice helping shippers manage transportation more effectively on a global basis Its clients now will have direct exposure to Arzoons transportation management trading network which provides online services for managing the full life cycle of work processes across all modes systems and enterprises Similarly Arzoon and its clients can access select AT Kearney consulting services the company said That includes inbound transportation management supplychain and distribution rationalization carrier selection and process improvement Arzoon said Superior transportation management has emerged as a critical success factor in the increasingly competitive world of commerce said Randy Garber transportation services coleader of AT Kearneys operations services practice We think service companies manufacturers and retailers that incorporate the speed simplicity and efficiency of the Internet into their supply chains will lead their markets The plan is for both AT Kearney and Arzoon to gain valuable understanding and insights into how the Internet creates great efficiencies in both the strategic and tactical needs of transportation professionals Garber added We believe that the knowledge gained from this collaboration will benefit our clients as well as Arzoons customers involved in the trillion global freight transportation market Garber said An Arzoon official said the company was very pleased to be associated with AT Kearney which Arzoon described

last couple of days and I understand that OU has a different recruiting schedule then other schools Enron is on campus for recruiting in the near future a nd I have asked Sally to tag on some interviews for summer interns while on th at trip I believe that she has been able to schedule this so I believe that from an OU perspective it may be a mute point now Doing that should be ab le to maintain the momentum that we have developed at OU and all the work Lexi has done By the way the recruiting trip a couple of weeks ago was very successful If you have any other questions or comments please let me know mike Charlene NRON AM To Sally CT cc Celeste CT Richard NRON Mike CT Subject Re Hiring Practices for Summer Interns Sally Thanks for the email regarding summer interns I apologize that Lexi and Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking I wis h that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin g difficulty I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any member of my staff was not responsive That being said please allow me to explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set it You are absolutely correct It is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge As you are aware over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm Brecker Merryman who has assisted us in a number of different mark et research projects However in my opinion this issue is not one that required much research I have been involved in recruiting in some way shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past years Most major organizations with the exception of the Accounting firm s begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring There are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date particularly in the MBA programs For example Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until January As indicated the firms that generally recrui t in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for spring internships The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns Presentations were made in January February and offers were made in February and March The only school that did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope We did of course recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enrons ability to hire quality s ummer interns This past summer Enron had summer Analysts undergraduate and summer Associates graduate We intentionally limited the number of summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful assignments Approximately of these individuals received permanent offers to join Enron The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire undergraduates for summer positions They generally focus on MBAs particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enrons competitors Because the undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have continued to have a special focus on these individuals ie the reason the re were undergraduates and only MBAs With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about which you raised a concern let me address your concerns In your email y ou indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU You did not howeve r provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU While OU has not gotten back to her following is the information obtained from UT o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson o According to Cindy approximately of companies actively recruiting on campus conduct interviews in the fall for summer internships Cindy attributes this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring or in the case of Andersen Consulting have a tremendous need and conduct all interviews at one time o In conclusion Cindy estimated that of companies actively recruiting on campus recruit in the spring for summer internships We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t he statistics at this time I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such information It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably different than what we were told If you would provide the name of the individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for the discrepancies While I understand your concern with respect to OU they appear to be different than most of the other schools at which we recruit If you belie ve that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are supportive however because Lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently As you are aware in most instances the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early August If you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts I hope this has been helpful I can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager Again I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i f you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance Charlene

leads This essentially reflects what I hope you already know that your HR lead support is ENA Me with Sheila Knudsen I ultimately hope Cindy Skinner will move to take this lead sometime next year EGM

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns David TO ALL ENA HR CC Olson Delainey Lavorato Frevert McMahon Bowen McConnell Shankman R Jones MBarnard MJoyce DLynch BVanCleve From Oxley Western Hemisphere Wholesale Energy HR Group Organisation Change When we launched our HR Franchise Team structure in February this year we did so with the commitment to continually refine and challenge ourselves to ensure we were optimising the resources we have available to help our businesses achieve and exceed their goals In fact you will recall in communicating the changes in February we actually highlighted what we anticipated would be a need to make further refinements and changes to maximise our effectiveness A great deal has happened in these last months and I am delighted that the Franchise team concept has contributed so much towards our far greater partnership with our individual business groups and our own outlook priorities and objectives We truly have revolutionised how we provide HR services and advice More importantly the business has recognised us for the huge progress we have made to date This success is an outstanding achievement and one that I hope you join me in being extremely proud of As is always the case at Enron continuous change is the norm and so as to illustrate this point quite effectively the businesses previously part of ENA have over the last months essentially been split into three Enron Global Markets set up to focus on the Global Fuels markets which were previously part of Enron Europe and CALME Coal Financial Tarding and InsuranceWeather which were all previously part of ENA EGM is now led by Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman Enron Industrial Markets set up to focus on the Industrial markets and expand our activities across new Industrial sectors which will build on the success of the Paper Pulp and Lumber business previously part of ENA and immediately develop a steel market EIM is led by Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen Enron North America remains the largest of these three businesses even after these changes and will now focus all of its efforts on the highly successful Gas and Power markets in North America including Canada and Mexico ENA continues to be led by Dave Delainey and John Lavorato Mark Frevert following his return from Europe has been instrumental in the restructuring of these businesses and is Chairman of each of these as well as Enron Europe which collectively now constitute Enrons entire activities in the Wholesale commodity markets These changes in the businesses we support clearly force us to reexamine the HR business model and adjust our strategy accordingly Fortunately our flexible organisation structure lends itself extremely well to realign along these new business lines and as such the changes illustrated below in the attached org chart are far easier for us to make than they might otherwise have been In addition given the immense value and positive client feedback we have received on our efforts to concentrate our HR resources on Franchise skill lines this also provides us with an opportunity to reinforce and refine our efforts in developing market intelligence employment propositions compensation ideas and best practices as well as the innovatively sourced talent pipelines in each of these areas to proactively provide our clients with a competitive advantage I believe the changes outlined on the attached org chart are self explanatory however if you have any questions please feel free to raise them either with your team leads or me Given that we have a staff meeting scheduled for Friday I would plan to walk through these changes with you and answer any questions at that time Finally to reinforce our goals and prepare you all for the next months I would like to underline the overall commitment to continue to change and flex our resources to anticipate meet and exceed our businesses needs This will clearly mean further organisation changes as we move forward This is not Change for changes sake but change and our ability to change quickly and as often as necessary is essential for us to remain a competitive and effective HR

Restricting Power Generation Competition in Asia Pacific Region I have not followed this closely but question why we would give a noncompete for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell This was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along It is a big piece of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners going forward or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we do It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive Maybe I dont

Generation Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman I am sending this email to you pursuant to the Enron Corp Policy on Noncompetition I would appreciate if you would check with your CEOCOO regarding this email and respond to me by Friday September if you have questions or concerns Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions that bind Enron affiliates by Monday October Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific Enron Asia PacificAfricaChina Enron APACHI is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company Newco Newco would be charged with making the shareholders investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders respective stakes in Newco The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a dumping ground for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia As a result Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the MarubeniEnron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates The following is a summary of these competition provisions Enron affiliates with the exceptions stated below could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region as defined below after first offering the opportunity to Newco If Newco declines the opportunity Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction OM offtaker or risk management services There are a number of exceptions to this rule a small projects involving MW or less b projects in which Enron owns less than a interest c projects initiated by our SK joint venture d Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron e projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than of the value of the acquisition and f situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction Affiliates will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publiclyowned eg Azurix Asia Pacific Region will be defined to include Brunei China including Hong Kong and Macau South Korea North Korea Taiwan Vietnam Laos Cambodia Thailand Myanmar the Philippines Malaysia Indonesia East Timor Singapore Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands including Guam Saipan the Federated States of Micronesia and Fiji but excluding Hawaii It does not include Japan and Australia The competition clause would survive until the earlier of a Enron selling its interest in Newco or b December Thank you Bruce Lundstrom General Counsel Enron APACHI

BergsiekerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT A G GelottiENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Bill GathmannENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Clay HarrisENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject RE Investment OpportunityDabhol Power Company Rick we can discuss this more at length in Mumbai this coming week Metgas is the only company that has any access to DPCs terminal As you know DPC is owned today by Enron MSEB GE and Bechtel At year end Enrons will be split to Enron and new investor Any changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC which is heavily influenced but not controlled by Enron The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA and Enron has this through Metgas Under the TARA Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that Metgas delivers to DPC In addition Metgas has rights to increase size of terminal at its cost So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real value here Today Metgas is owned and controlled by Enron so Enron has control But in any sale of Metgas Enrons control will be lessened Under current plans to avoid debt consolidation we will reduce Enrons equity position to or less which means we are at best sharing control with someone else or maybe a group of someone elses If Enron is uncomfortable with this because it views access to Metgas terminal as part of larger LNG role we should discuss ASAP AG please allow time on Wednesdays agenda to discuss these issues with

are designed I am not as familiar with the Metgas voting procedures but there is certainly the opportunity to negotiated something there since it is still in development Also there should be

Review of Art and Literature Harry N Abrams New York p ill Image size x inches Sheet size x inches At the beginning of the s Matisse was starting to concentrate on th e technique of using cut pape collages to create abstract color compositions The dense smooth colors and clearcut shapes created a totally new artistic language for him It was in seeking to extend this concept that he began under the encouragement of the publisher Teriade to experiment with using t he same types of form created through stencil printing At first he used cut stencil shapes linked to lithography and then move to using the stencils with pochoir color for this removed problem of lithography diluting the col or intensity Matisses project was to create an album titled Jazz forms expressed through a brilliant highly emotional purity of vibrant color The first trials were made using lithography and it was in this connection that the Icarus composition above was issued by Teriade in Verve as a form of publicity for the forthcoming album It is one of the great characteristic images of Matisses oeuvre of this period Image Roy Lichtenstein American COMPOSITION FOR THE SOLOMON R GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM

emphasized during my recent trips to South America Japan and Korea Overall the trips were definitely worth the effort and each business unit n ow truly gets the ENW story and what we are attempting to accomplish The efforts over the past months are really beginning to pay dividends This is not meant to be a complete laundry list of all the important issues and discussed topics but rather a briefing of a few top priorities and items fo r each group Enron South America I met with the entire management team as a group in Rio at an ESA board meeting and most of the key individuals separately Sugar coffee and orange juice were new commodities that were brought up by numerous groups as consideration for new ENW efforts due to their desirable market characteristics Pulp and Paper additional activity has already begun and is currently bei ng worked with Greg Piper I believe that this is the best and shortterm opportunity out there Metals and mining is big in South America This was also brought up frequently and I told DArcy Carroll that we would get back to them upon further closure of MG and that this could move quickly up the food chain bu t not to focus as top priority yet DArcy former Cargill trader has strong connections at Cargill and believes that we can go in compete and capture their markets He also has several candidates and resumes which have been sent to Robert Jones for consideration for trading positions for our new agriculture trading activities Greg I will forward to you also I dont believe I sent them to you DArcy and Steve Nagy are putting together more of a business plan for the rest of with regard to commercial opportunities I have been pleased to date with Steve and his initial functions as a technology origination role but it is time to put some tangible goals and results on the table Dan Bruce VP international infrastructure is going to focus more time o n ESA Philippe and I are in the process of finalizing Regional VPs and focusing Dan to this region this is not finalized yet They need serious help in their trading systems and more senior support overall Will wait until decision made on Project California Enron Japan Joe is building an impressive team and he has a thorough and well thought o ut business plan Japan has the opportunity to be really big another Enron Europe and we have an excellent opportunity to get it right from the star t and drive this market He is in a unique position to develop a huge busine ss and drive it with technology without having the burden of a large legacy problem I think they look more like an Enron Net Works type of business than most the other business units Enron Japan needs to use the internet to educate and drive this new business to achieve the penetration it needs without an incumbent position The competition and market characteristics fit very well with our statements about ENW in our general presentations Anthony Dayeo has just joined the team Between ENW providing a VP of Anthonys caliber and our other time commitments we are really helping thi s business Initial technology focus will be internet and website driven Coordinati ng with Steve Kean to take a fresh approach to knocking down regulatory barrie rs John Sherriff is managing this business from a commodity point of view an d I think our groups working together will make this a high return future business Human capital is a key constraint issue and we went through priorities an d prioritized for greater effectiveness The group is thinking about using technology the internet and eCommerce every day Enron Korea SK Enron The activities and business plans were much better than I had expected I asked them to go through and discuss their eBusiness plan and it was quite thorough They have completed initial evaluation of EOL applications for the regio n hard copy attached KWeather is already introducing weather derivatives in Korea best shortterm oppt Definite metals opportunity here MG

has million customers that are not being tapped at all Interesting oppt with alliance partners AOL The SKEnron changes and opportunities that are underway are a great example of Enrons ENW ability to change from an old to new economy business A second round eBusiness plan is coming and we can evaluate as a group Excellent executive meeting and dinner with Tony Chey Owner and Chairman of SK SK is a billion company and Tony is the th richest and most powerful person in Korea I went through EnronOnline and our thoughts on t he future of the internet This was very helpful with future events with SK We are definitely setting up a network of eBusiness opportunities within Enron Jeff the commercial opportunities and accountabilities that have begun via the creation of the technology origination

thanks for all of the support in the placement of the former CALME employees We are done to just a very few at this time It appears that your new squad is getting some traction on building the LNG business Im pleased to hear that I look forward to hearing how our transportation or logistics business is developing Perhaps we can get together sometime during the San Antonio conference to catch up All the best Shawn PS the following is an interesting article about the online intermodal landscape Hashing Out Ecommerce JOHN GALLAGHER Traffic World Page Copyright Gale Group Inc All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Journal of Commerce Inc Dotcoms explain how they hope to compete in intermodal market and among themselves With some websites devoted to transportation ecommerce companies acknowledge that its difficult for potential customers to cut through the confusion and figure out whos doing what and whos going to be with them for the long term Because of the competition between their respective railroad partners one of the bigger questions for intermodal shippers is the relationship between Arzoon and Freightwise There has been speculation that after Freightwise was established by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway four competitors Union Pacific Railroad Norfolk Southern CSX and Canadian Pacific Railway teamed up with rival ecommerce site Arzoon in a response to BNSFs proposed merger with Canadian National Railway However both Freightwise and Arzoon claim thats not the case Im continually asked Whats up with the four railroads and Arzoon said Charley Eisele UP senior vice president strategic planning People are trying to make a whole lot out of the coincidence of these two things from a timing perspective The reality is it was a decision made on the underlying business model Freightwise executives agree with that assessment pointing out that because the industry happened to be divided along merger lines at the same time the railroads were aligning with ecommerce initiatives it seemed too much of a coincidence that the same four railroads opposing the merger were the ones joining Arzoon However I think to launch a company like this takes more than just a reaction to a merger said Freightwise Chief Marketing Officer Sanjay Joshi There are major differences between the two Internet companies starting with their business plans Arzoon categorizes itself as a shippercentric transportation management system whose target market is the roughly percent of the transportation business that currently moves under contract Freightwise on the other hand classifies itself as a transportation exchange and is targeting the remaining percent of the market procured on a spot basis Arzoon whose primary focus is the shipper is setting out to help manage the relationships that already exist between shipper and carrier The priority for carrierfocused Freightwise is to make sure the capacity is there for shippers who log on to their system In addition Arzoon which currently is involved only with rail and truck wants eventually to become a transportation management system that manages across all modes and borders including ocean and air freight said Eisele Freightwise will stick to truckload and intermodal for the time being Were not sure about getting involved with air freight given the size of the market and the economics said Joshi It takes a different set of products and economics than surface transportation Maybe sometime down the line but right now we really plan on getting entrenched in the truckload and intermodal spot market We think thats a lot to chew The key is to focus on a particular footprint that we can begin to own rather than get too broad and lose focus The fact that Arzoon and Freightwise have teamed up with different rail carriers is another cause for concern Will there be a disincentive on the part of carriers to use each others ecommerce initiatives and ultimately therefore a disadvantage for prospective customers The answer is the rule said a source from an Arzoon rail partner A particular shipper is in a position where percent of their business is conducted via truck and other modes and maybe only percent via railroads If the choice presented to them is to select a system that addresses all modes effectively or one that only addresses a particular mode then the rule would suggest that greater leverage would lie in picking the broader multimode transportation management system In that case even though a railroad may have another ecommerce approach it would clearly have to respond to the customers needs in that situation Freightwises Joshi makes a similar argument Freightwise is merely another channel for BNSF to market its services he said It posts a certain set of rates for what it believes to be fair for the service Its not for Freightwise to decide what rates BNSF decides to move through its channel UP may not decide to post its rates on Freightwise Joshi said so then BNSF would have to find out whats the competitive rate relative to UP Another question arises as to whether Arzoon may have a competitive advantage over Freightwise particularly from an intermodal standpoint because it is backed by both Eastern and Western carriers whereas Freightwise is backed only by BNSF I would only say that the partnership we have with BNSF is not exclusive and that were talking to other railroads as well Joshi noted He added This is an exchange to market your capacity and services It would be very difficult for six railroads to do something on their own there would be no critical mass Its to the advantage of the other railroads to participate Along with BNSF which provides Freightwise with instant capacity the company recently signed GE Corp as an anchor tenant and equity investor that will help Freightwise reach the critical mass Joshi talks about As both a major supplier to the rail industry locomotives and a potential shipper appliances the goal is to use GE as something we can leverage and work with their respective divisions as a way to reduce their transportation costs he said Visibility is a key advantage for potential customers of both Interment companies As a transportation management system with access to all modes it allows shippers to be more efficient in the management of transportation Eisele said Crossmodal visibility means that because theyll be managing their truck business under the same system as rail the economics of rail will be much more visible And we believe that with comparable reliability the economics will be compelling to the point where rails will garner a greater share of those customers total transportation buy Joshi claims a big difference between Freightwise and other exchanges is that when a shipper is looking for transportation options between specific origindestination pairs Freightwise allows customers to make sidebyside comparisons between truck and intermodal It is this price and service transparency Joshi says that will save its customers money Were giving customers three to five choices between truck and intermodal not so that they can see service and price parameters Intermodal ecommerce ventures such as Freightwise also bring up the question of competition with traditional intermodal marketing companies Joshi points out that its fee for doing a lot of what small and midsize IMCs do currently such as load matching tracking and tracing and order processing is percent which is split between the buyer and seller of the services This compares to the to percent that customers traditionally have paid for retaining an IMC I dont think all brokers will embrace us Joshi conceded but at the same time there will be a segment of brokers who will begin migrating into higheraddedvalue services for example the thirdparty logistics side rather than the classical brokerage Theyll get into things like inventory management on behalf of shippers and leave backend processing to firms like Freightwise Webmodal which is a purely intermodal ecommerce venture whose vision is to make intermodal much more like truck in the eyes of the shipper points out that it can take customers several days to receive a bid from a traditional IMC We can immediately configure door to door intermodal solutions that we can put together using our underlying carrier relationships said Webmodal founder and CEO Chris Kravas We do business with a lot of large US railroads and with drayage companies We give everybody access to all the information they might need to make decisions on price vs service tradeoffs and which carriers make most sense based on what the shipper is trying to do And we do it without the traditional onetothreeday wait that typically happens in response to a normal request for intermodal services Kravas said the company has invested time and expertise in developing what it calls a firstever schedule engine that works door to door Traditionally the industry hasnt had a schedule engine that involves the drayplusrailplusdray services so theres been pretty much a reliance on rules of thumb But the truth is it doesnt take anywhere near eight days for most origindestination pairs We have a very robust way of representing the capabilities of the dray carriers as well as the rail carriers so that much more trucklike transit can be shown to be viable Because of this Webmodal sees itself as more of a technology and ecommerce company than a traditional IMC and considers itself more a vendor than a competitor How does a small or midsize IMC work as a customer of Webmodal Not all small IMCs are set up to do business with all of the railroads or with a large set of drayage companies Kravas said What we do for them is give them a lowcost way to access a comprehensive array of intermodal products and services available in the US Weve established ourselves as a business partner with a large base of firstrate drayage companies across the country So if youre an IMC with an opportunity to handle freight in a new market Webmodal allows you to put together a service and pay only a modest fee Kravas wouldnt disclose the companys fee structure only that it charges per shipment for a webbased order and a slightly higher fee for a phone or fax order A smaller IMC also could use Webmodal to put in place a private version of its technology that would enable the IMC to better manage its business That would range from pricing order fulfillment customer service kind of the whole spectrum of capabilities that would allow an IMC to take advantage of our system Kravas said Everyones waiting to see whos going to survive the transportation dotcom fallout Before that happens however Freightwise may find itself as big a competitor with Arzoon as it is with a company like Webmodal Were starting from different points said Freightwises Joshi but down the line yes I can see more headtohead competition between the two companies In addition to establishing itself in that percent of the market devoted to transportation contracts UPs Eisele notes that Arzoon also has a catalogcapability function which eventually can be used to auction capacity in the spot market the market in which Freightwise is establishing itself We will very much have the capability to enable spot market buying he said As Webmodals Kravas pointed out Its going to be an interesting next six months ArzoonAT Kearney partnership Consulting firm AT Kearney a unit of Dallasbased EDS and Arzoon which provides Internetbased services for managing transportation work processes worldwide have formed a strategic alliance AT Kearney was one of the first to establish a dedicated practice helping shippers manage transportation more effectively on a global basis Its clients now will have direct exposure to Arzoons transportation management trading network which provides online services for managing the full life cycle of work processes across all modes systems and enterprises Similarly Arzoon and its clients can access select AT Kearney consulting services the company said That includes inbound transportation management supplychain and distribution rationalization carrier selection and process improvement Arzoon said Superior transportation management has emerged as a critical success factor in the increasingly competitive world of commerce said Randy Garber transportation services coleader of AT Kearneys operations services practice We think service companies manufacturers and retailers that incorporate the speed simplicity and

McConnellHOUECT Subject Re Jose LNG Crude Pricing Our ability in crude is apparently very poor What can J Wilson do thru I want the crude desk to make us a price and present an acceptable volume If we have to suggest to PDVSA only doing a crude index through I strongly believe we should try if we can create some additional value thru this structure Tell me if you would like me to give him a call to explain what the effort potentially create Thanks Eric Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Eric Groves To Guido CarantiENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Emilio VicensENRON NRONDEVELOPMENt Eric CT cc Subject Re Jose LNG Crude Pricing Per a conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the Houston office the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent on a year deal is NOT a possibility If we had of our GSA price linked to Brent our exposure for years would be about million barrels notional or about million barrels PV At our exposure would still be million notional or million PV According to John he would not be comfortable doing anything past and even out that far he would not consider doing more than about million PV barrels in the years Given these comments I would say that the size of our deal basically precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time As far as the economics of the deal are concerned we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to figure out our economics I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see if we could get a year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that the hedging costs would be too high and therefore have left it at that for the time being Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue Thanks Eric Guido NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Eric CT cc Emilio VicensENRON NRON CT Larry CT Cris CT Brent A CT Eric CT Daniel R RogersENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Jose LNG Offtake Comments Eric thanks for your comments Please see below in blue our observations and answers Lets talk later today if you have further questions Saludos Guido and Emilio Enron Offtake Agreement Section Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the EPC agreement Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers In addition it preserves your year offtake which should still match your GSA The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen that being the earlier of months after Financial Close or NTP or Dec We will add to this list the earlier of something like the date on which the plant has produced LNG at at least of its capacity for a period of consecutive days We suggest putting something like this as opposed to commercial hand over because this is in the plantscontractors control and they could for example on purpose not meet a noise level requirement for months for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project but we as offtakers can not wait for ever for the project to be completed with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow directly or indirectly under the projects control We have months limits to how much the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC or another EPC Contractor already built in Section I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of We agree that would be better but we included this section knowing that is something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA because they dont want us to sell down and then keep controlling new LNG businesses in Jose They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA We think that adding a restriction to the assets returns now in the draft will make it very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause Thus jeopardizing our chance to control the output of future plants or expansions We never intended to use these offtake agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes Nevertheless we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial control of the output Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will clearly realize what our intent is Section Where is the bonus calculation We did not include it now on purpose We will include it when ever they remind us to do so We want to have another fight about the bonus Where is the min price The minimum price is in We say that one of the terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number We are going to try to do it but that is first a GSA issue and we dont want to put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA We precisely bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we want to make it zero Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics No we dont have the definitive answer from structuring yet but our guess and based on our meeting with RAC the other day in which they told us about the mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba Brazil power plant we are pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not convenient But since we dont have a definitive answer yet we still included oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting that should have been bracketed in the termsheet though and it will Section you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate Is this your intent to have a mismatch Yes we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as offtaker and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if they do you have all new taxes being borne by the project company Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized See section of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue The exporter of record will be the project so the buyer has no business in Venezuela other than paying port fees We do not see any kind of taxes that could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred to the project Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that projects typically take all the time the heavy crude projects are some examples in Venezuela In addition the GSA provides for a number of reliefs for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel safer Although a large portion of the underlying risk is always there Other where are the LD calculations explained I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default GSA default should match LDs in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better New York law provides for full market based damages market price of commodity plus extra costs which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD clause So from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it as it is We are still discussing w Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is sellable to AA for MTM but our initial view is that it should be since the level of LD can not be better GSA default is market based provided that PDVSA as we expect accepts the change we will propose so the Project Company will be able to pay market based damages For interruption of gas supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being relieved from performance in such event this will obviously be to a maximum dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time say months we need time to give you precision on this but some sort of coverage will be available suppose the plant produces less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems not a FM issue at commercial hand over What happens under the offtake agreements Will the banks accept this revenue short fall Will we have to create a reserve This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry Under the offtake agreements the project pays market based damages if it does not meet the contracted volume We believe that the contracted volume that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks and equity holders to bear the risk We are contracting for contractually guaranteed production under the EPC which is lower than expected On top of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible meaning a lower LNG volume This volume is lower than the guaranteed production with Normal or expected feed composition Combining these two we have a contracted quantity that is lower than the expected production with expected feed On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least above what was expected mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs Also the EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equityholders whole They dont provide though for damages payable under offtake contracts nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs However as we explained we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co Banks will most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption as we already did What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is resolved what compensation do the offtakers get do the banks suffer here as well The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to determine failure to deliver by Seller It also establishes that deliveries should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant The bottom line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of defaults and price differentials It sets however a reasonable standard by which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur based on the reasonable constant deliveries provision damages will be payable based on prices during such month Yes banks suffer here to the extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable Nevertheless short periods weeks of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect the Project Company ability to pay the Banks It will have to be some prolonged period for Banks to be affected Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first days Will the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established Is this in your model We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard although we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected Our model assumes the cost of an LC for month debt service which should be plenty The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather damages not BI are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not permitted for MTM reasons The question that follows is if damages exceed the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its obligation to deliver have the damages have to be senior to debt payments for AA to allow MTM to be permitted If this is so are the banks going to be willing to live with this probably not insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling It is briefly covered in section second paragraph This will be expended in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to PDVSA insert termination section In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an offtaker than an asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law than if we try to right an early termination clause They point out also that of LNG contracts are done in this way having NY law rule the game They point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements for financing requirements We will Eric CT AM To Guido CarantiENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Emilio VicensENRON NRONDEVELOPMENt cc Larry nron Cris CT Brent A CT Eric CT Daniel R RogersENRON

BergsiekerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Mike CT Subject Oxy meeting We just finished the meeting with Dale Laurance and Casey Olson Heres a recap Oxy wanted to meet with Mike for two reasons Make sure Enron and Oxy had a project team in place asap and the resources are committed to do a world class job on the January submission and subsequent presentations As Mike noted we are in sudden death overtime and the th could be the end of the tournament Revisit the street talk about Enron redeploying capital Mike walked through the EGM organization talked about our stock multiple and how an announcement that we were putting huge dollars in Saudi would hurt our stock price Dale talked about their low multiple between and noted that the market viewed Oxy as a company that could do deals buy and sell assets but really wasnt a growth company They now have a stable cash flow but need a new beach head in the Middle East to demonstrate they are growing The point of this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being dumped into Saudi Arabia They characterized the Saudi perspective as being one where they are looking for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital They agree on a division of labor Oxy can do EP processing and petrochemicals and look to us for pipelines and power plants although Oxy can do those too They realize that only Enron has the marketing structuring and regulatory expertise Casey did revisit his conversation with you about in the end Enron ends up as some type of merchant banker Thats OK in the end Dale even said they would take over our part of any project but we cant project that role initially We need to be on the same side of the table as Oxy The point here is that we have to be in step with a consistent approach to the projects They expect our competitors to say theyll finance things on balance sheet and we need initially to say the same thing although later we will open discussions on other ways to finance Mike and I agree that this is probably the biggest sticking point in the discussion today Oxy believes that such an initial statement will never be public and we arent really locked in an onbalance sheet approach Maybe we can do this maybe we cant They see this as a year long process with PDAs stretching well into next year and when the real money would be spent The short term crisis is January and we need a submission with lots of pages we were criticized that although our proposal was well thought through and technically superb it didnt have enough pages reams of paper to impress the technocrats We will also need to prepare a smaller page digest to be used for our official February presentation and a three page walk around summary Casey thinks the production center has to be in the US We also all agreed that the Jan questions allow us to lay out all of our downstream concerns and establish a placeholder for issues that must be resolved during the PDA discussions before we would do a project I have had the greatest success around the world when we dont try to force immediately on a country a perfect gas or electric market but adapt to local conditions and implement the most important first couple of steps with the rest to follow later In this respect our projects can include suggested regulatory concepts that if successful can be used elsewhere in the Kingdom Over and over we came back to the project team which they want on the ground in Saudi Casey will be Saudi for the foreseeable future and can make all decisions Who will be our lead person with the same authority They dont want to deal with someone who later says Houston changed its mind a little arrogant When can we identify bodies and assignments and location They want full time dedicated people Either Dale or Casey noted that the old Enron would have parachuted a team in by now Like South America where we landed in a swamp and spent the next five years beating alligators over the head with a stick This is a very complicated political and technical effort The leader has to be good at both Casey was excited that Rob would be assigned to the project I guess you discussed this with him They both were quick to say that the working relationship to date has been excellent and that they appreciate the effort we have put into this Mike committed that we would go balls to the wall for the th deadline I committed that I would designate a project team by the first week in January we had our first conference call yesterday but Mike said he wanted to think about the decision point person and process we arent about to sacrifice a deliberative strategicconsensus thought process because they are in a hurry We spent a lot of time talking about the process We agree that the Saudis will eliminate one or two participants that each project will have subparts with different combinations and leads of companies with a master JV on top They minimized the capital investment although they are prepared to spent million over the next years They see core project costing million OxyEnron assuming one other partner and Enron half of that We arent talking billions spoken like a true major They are sure Exxon Mobil will be our Red Sea partner if only to earn face with possibly Marathon as the other Exxon is more interested in the chemical focus which Oxy will concede to them Mike noted was that our worst nightmare was a partner Exxon who would throw away money just to have a presence We were assured that Oxys only goal was to make money and if he projects didnt they would walk away The real danger in the upstream is the risk money for exploration Oxy hopes to hedge this risk with downstream investments pipelines and plants and hopes that if the exploration is successful and reserves are added it will lead to a whole new series of projects They are very proud of Oxys role in this claim that they were instrumental in getting Petry Parkman and Morgan selected as advisors that Irani is the most respected American Arab business man and has great access in the Kingdom and that they already know what investments partners are acceptable to the Saudis We all left great friends in good Christmas spirit From our perspective Saudi is the largest economy in the Middle east and the driver in international oil and liquids markets Enron needs to get inside and establish relationships with the key Saudi people We need a foot print in the Kingdom with which to earn their respect Can we do it with minimal capital investment Saudi is about to embark of a complete electric and gas restructuring regulatory included They want the repatriation of petro dollars and dollars held offshore by Saudi nationals The country can be a tremendous source of capital It looks like can be managed with a minimum burn rate with the most intense period of activity being in January We need to set up the team for the January effort Ill have this done by Jan There is the question of sorting out conflicts with other ME priorities Although it may be too soon to answer we dont know yet what is possible but we can shape that outcome what is the end game what do we want out of Saudi Arabia We seem to have a clear division of labor and strategy with Oxy although we need to sort out what we say about on balance sheet financing We also need to keep in mind that our other yet to be met partners will have a lot to say Oxy wants to take the lead on the Core Venture Red Sea I agree this is a perfect laboratory to address all of the market structure issues that will make the Kingdom a great place to do business Mike Im sure you can add more Rick its up to you if you want to send this around to the Saudi team Merry Christmas

Mike CT cc Jeffrey CT Greg Whalley Subject Re ClickPapercom First thanks for jumping in on this I am confident we can get it done even though it will be a fire drill We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there it was just being held or managed in four places It will all be pulled together by Monday in one place one complete document and will have about major categories with specific tasks under each category with status person responsible comments and date to be completed It will also have a complete timeline We can review that Monday and agree on its content Louise agreed to review it as well As it relates to the people you mentioned let me know how andor who you want to pull in after we agree on the control document That way we will know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them Salley Beck called she mentioned you had called her as well and we agreed that the ClickPapers back office representative would officially be Scott Earnest he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with him for months She is going to get in place people to be our Product Control Group for CP launch on July th Scott and Salley will work to source it so that we have or people trained and ready on the th to receive password applications create customer profiles on ClickPaper and start the applications through credit legal and tax and finally get out user IDs to clients We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their people unless there is some emergency Remember we are only setting up people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified We also have a help desk person starting next week I dont have his name yet but we have him and one more on the way We will create for them a brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave We walked inch by inch through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done We have a few holes but it is not that far away She is going to think about a process document for this and get back to me Monday I have a detailed EOL one and we will give it our shot this weekend Let me know what Mark Palmer says He knows we have been using Margaret We will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan and what she needs to do We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive mailing a letter that does not include temporary IDspasswords We will tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers we want to use this time to get them preregistered Besides there is no way to test a temporary IDs anyway We will send those out later as I said earlier the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area or garden as Lousie would call it by next for Friday or the following Monday That way people can surf the content and get registered On legal I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we had a detailed discussion today about the contracts what is needed and the deadline There is legal work left to do the current draft of the password application doesnt work but if Taylor can help that would be great We will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy with Bob Crane and Hal as well to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control issues associated with it Credit is fine we have been working with Bradford for months but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual posting I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and views The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all their comments by the end of next week They will also be given the complete Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to help the roll out We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday July nd for the final testing of the system Remember the th is a one Enrontomany launch with a financial market only ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section Enron is so it is simply a new distribution channel for Enrons existing financial offering Later we will build it out for physical probably sooner rather than later Finally I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop but Louise said today that is October or November It will only be manytomany if someone comes in and makes a compelling case to do so Thanks See you tomorrow GP To Greg nron cc Subject ClickPapercom Greg a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Mondays meeting I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines personnel responsibilities and key action items I think this is another good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and assignments Andrew Parsons Sr Director and superior performer is a great and very smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort You will like him and he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team even if it is for a couple of weeks He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform He has others on his team that could help and Ive asked him to think about his existing AA resources that are available some are working on ClickPaper already Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the short run Beth Pearlman John Tollefson IT Bob Schultz LK said she could spare him without delaying phase roll out Dave Forester not a good option because it would definitely set back phase roll out Mary Solmenson Scott Mills Berry Pearce David Port David Sweeny Sally Beck advice and discuss additional resources I did ask Louise to jump in and i know you did too to help on some quick thoughts on process and lessons learned I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they or the simplified early versions are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper I went by to see Mark Palmer he was out and left him a voice mail on the marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing I wanted him to make sure that he understood the importance and priority of this effort I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out or assigning John Tollefson and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday afternoon Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to add a trading perspective A few thoughts see you tomorrow mike

being used is the standard type of Contract used for the proposed transaction The Contract is promulgated by the Texas Real Estate Commission and is to be used by all licensed Real Estate Brokers and Agents We are interested in knowing however if the Contract was filled out by Mr Larry Williams of Prudential Gary Greene Realtors If so does Mr Williams represent you or Flair Construction Co Inc Please advise us accordingly As we discussed we think it is most important that you have the opportunity to read and review the Construction Agreement that Flair Construction Co Inc intends on using for the construction of your home The fact that Flair is both the Developer as well as the potential Builder raises some issues Usually Builders have agreements with the Developer regarding the purchase of lots and building on same Often lots are reserved to certain Builders and if you purchase those lots you are required to use the designated Builders However often lots are free to be purchased by potential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want We are interested in knowing if the lots you are purchasing are actually reserved to Flair Construction Co Inc or is Flair just requiring you to use them to build your home since they are selling you the lots in question As you point out in your letter if you sign the Contract as it now reads you are captive to the Builder and are not free to negotiate with other Builders It appears to us that you will be one of the first homeowners in this new subdivision We think it is critically important that you get a copy of the Deed Restrictions even before you sign the Contract to make sure that there are restrictions in place regarding the size of homes to be built size of lots etc We want to make sure that your home is not horribly atypical for the neighborhood We do not know if The Lakes of Sterling Gate Estates is in the City of Houston or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction This is something you may want to find out as soon as possible If it is outside the city limits is there already a MUD district in place to provide water and sewer services Since this is a brand new subdivision your concern regarding its future development and tax rate is very legitimate Usually until the subdivision is fairly well built out the Developer controls the Community Association as well as the Architectural Control Committee Therefore if this subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of the Developer We recommend in the strongest terms possible that you talk with recent customers of Flair Construction Co Inc to make sure that they were happy with the construction of their homes as well as warranty work Some Builders are far better than others as it relates to followup warranty work after their customers move into their homes We normally recommend that homeowners do not move into their homes until all punch list items are completed to the satisfaction of the homeowner The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract We will now make more specific comments and suggestions in chronological order regarding the Contract Paragraph PROPERTY As we previously stated we think it is important that you acquire copies of the Restrictive Covenants and Deed Restrictions as soon as possible You will be responsible to pay assessments to the Property Owners Association Since Flair is both the Builder and Developer you may want to ask Mr Kent for an estimate of what your Community Association Fees will be Paragraph EARNEST MONEY We suggest that the earnest money be paid to the Title Company and not to Flair Construction Co Inc Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY The standard printed exception as to discrepancies conflicts shortages in area or boundary lines encroachments or protrusions or overlapping improvements is in your Owners Policy In other words the title policy does not cover these types of discrepancies or conflicts However if a survey is completed and an additional fifteen percent of the policy premium is paid the title company will probably delete this exception This is something you may want to consider However this cost would be yours to incur If however it is subsequently discovered that there are such discrepancies and conflicts or shortages then you will have title insurance coverage accordingly Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY last paragraph Make sure you are provided a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance as soon as possible Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY B It appears to us that the only survey you will be provided with by the Seller is one for the new recorded plat of the subdivision Therefore the Seller is not providing you a survey of your actual lots If you were to have the standard printed exception as to discrepancies and conflicts deleted we believe you would need a survey of your lots You will have seven days after you receive the Commitment andor the survey to object in writing to any matters disclosed or you will be deemed to waive such objections accordingly Therefore please make sure that we have the opportunity to review the survey and commitment as soon as possible after you receive same Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY We agree that this paragraph relating to the Sellers right to continue to show the property for sale should be deleted Paragraph PROPERTY CONDITION B We suggest that this paragraph be checked and utilized rather than paragraph B which states that you will be accepting the property in its present condition Paragraph B states that you will pay a fee usually very small like for the unrestricted right to terminate the contract in the event the property is not suitable for the purposes for which you intend on using it In other words you can have whatever inspectors you deem necessary to look at the property to make sure that it is satisfactory for your home construction We often suggest that an independent inspector be hired by the homeowner to inspect and review the construction of the home as it progresses In addition there may be some environmental issues or soil condition questions that an inspector might raise if given the opportunity As the Contract now reads you are simply accepting the property as is and have no right to send an inspector out to the property accordingly Paragraph BROKERS FEES You may want an affirmative statement that you as the Buyer will not be responsible for or pay any Brokers fees Paragraph SPECIAL PROVISIONS It is written in that the closing on these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March whichever is later However we do not know what roads are being addressed and think that this sentence needs far more specificity The second sentence regarding your obligation to use Flair Homes has already been addressed earlier The third sentence regarding when construction must start should be revised to give you more time as you make reference in your letter However we also suggest that the Builder be put under an obligation to start construction within thirty days after the date you notify him that you are ready for construction to begin Paragraph ROLLBACK TAXES If there was ever an agricultural or timber exemption on this property you need to know Otherwise you will be obligated to pay rollback taxes on the property which may go back five years Paragraph ESCROW As we indicated earlier we believe your earnest money should be paid to the title company In light of the fact that the earnest money is in excess of and the closing date on the lots is somewhat uncertain we suggest that you ask the title company to deposit the earnest money in an interest bearing account and that you receive a credit accordingly Please call us after you read and review this letter Very truly yours Donald S Stirman DSScsb

Email Subject LNGs Role in North American Caribbean Gas Supply Mike Understand LNG continues to be an enigma cloaked in a mystery for Enron We are continuing to expand our coverage and knowledge base of this marketplace especially in the Western Hemisphere and would like to meet with you to discuss our observations and learn more about Enrons desires in this arena Also we have a meeting planned in DC in late June entitled LNGs Role in North American Caribbean Gas Supply With the US hunger for gas and El Paso AEC and others announcements of new projects the meeting should be constructive especially with DOE and FERC involvement See summary below Let me know when you might be available to discuss the LNG marketplace Weve just completed a white paper entitled AtlanticBasin LNG A Whirling SupplyDemand Balance You may find our conclusions of interest Best regards Bob Nimocks President Zeus Development Corporation wwwzeusdevelopmentcom Wilcrest Dr Suite Houston TX Direct Main GRDATA email TITLE LNGs Role in North American Caribbean Gas Supply DATELOCATION Washington DC June SUMMARY The winter of confirmed the shift in the United States from a buyers to a sellers market Gas supplies for North America ran short as demand rose from colder weather higher electricity demand and shortages in storage from the previous year More and more supply is shifting from the US Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico has proven disappointing US demand for power generation is expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of siphoning off gas that would have been destined for storage Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the s drilling rigs and experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred The current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near full capacity at just over rigs so the industry is constrained on how quickly it can recover The US has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the s and early s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas in years Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from North Africa Algeria These terminals are capable of supplying up to of total US gas consumption about one trillion cubic feet per year Plans are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of however more are needed Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived to be unsightly or dangerous Now El Paso a company that was burned by Congress in the s by the ruling that takeorpay LNG contracts with Algeria were invalid is challenging conventional wisdom They have announced plans for six new terminals to be built in North America three in the United States and three in Mexico New LNG plants in Venezuela Algeria and Northern Australia might supply these terminals Other companies such as Enron and AEC have announced plans to build terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production IPP plants ranging from to megawatts Moreover LNG facilities on Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via undersea pipeline and cable Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and community concern The June conference entitled LNGs Role in North American Caribbean Gas Supply will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas supply shortages how long they are expected to last and what source of natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand The conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG including the capacities and timing of current terminals the prospects for new mainland and offshore terminals and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the Caribbean including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to the United States

supplies for North America ran short as demand rose from colder weather higher electricity demand and shortages in storage from the previous year More and more supply is shifting from the US Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico has proven disappointing US demand for power generation is expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of siphoning off gas that would have been destined for storage Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the s drilling rigs and experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred The current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near full capacity at just over rigs so the industry is constrained on how quickly it can recover The US has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the s and early s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas in years Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from North Africa Algeria These terminals are capable of supplying up to of total US gas consumption about one trillion cubic feet per year Plans are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of however more are needed Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived to be unsightly or dangerous Now El Paso a company that was burned by Congress in the s by the ruling that takeorpay LNG contracts with Algeria were invalid is challenging conventional wisdom They have announced plans for six new terminals to be built in North America three in the United States and three in Mexico New LNG plants in Venezuela Algeria and Northern Australia might supply these terminals Other companies such as Enron and AEC have announced plans to build terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production IPP plants ranging from to megawatts Moreover LNG facilities on Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via undersea pipeline and cable Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and community concern The June conference entitled LNGs Role in North American Caribbean Gas Supply will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas supply shortages how long they are expected to last and what source of natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand The conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG including the capacities and timing of current terminals the prospects for new mainland and offshore terminals and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the Caribbean including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to the United States

STIRMAN MEDIATOR CLIFFORD L PARMLEY MD JD OF COUNSEL JOSEPH T KENNEDY ERIC R HIRD KEVIN T SHEA TELEPHONE FAX February Via email Mr Mrs Mike McConnell Belhaven Drive Houston TX RE Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction Co Inc as Seller and Mike and Chris McConnell as Buyer Dear Mike We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract and your letter to us regarding same dated February We want to respond to the questions and issues raised in your letter as well as make some suggestions and comments about the proposed Contract itself First the Contract being used is the standard type of Contract used for the proposed transaction The Contract is promulgated by the Texas Real Estate Commission and is to be used by all licensed Real Estate Brokers and Agents We are interested in knowing however if the Contract was filled out by Mr Larry Williams of Prudential Gary Greene Realtors If so does Mr Williams represent you or Flair Construction Co Inc Please advise us accordingly As we discussed we think it is most important that you have the opportunity to read and review the Construction Agreement that Flair Construction Co Inc intends on using for the construction of your home The fact that Flair is both the Developer as well as the potential Builder raises some issues Usually Builders have agreements with the Developer regarding the purchase of lots and building on same Often lots are reserved to certain Builders and if you purchase those lots you are required to use the designated Builders However often lots are free to be purchased by potential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want We are interested in knowing if the lots you are purchasing are actually reserved to Flair Construction Co Inc or is Flair just requiring you to use them to build your home since they are selling you the lots in question As you point out in your letter if you sign the Contract as it now reads you are captive to the Builder and are not free to negotiate with other Builders It appears to us that you will be one of the first homeowners in this new subdivision We think it is critically important that you get a copy of the Deed Restrictions even before you sign the Contract to make sure that there are restrictions in place regarding the size of homes to be built size of lots etc We want to make sure that your home is not horribly atypical for the neighborhood We do not know if The Lakes of Sterling Gate Estates is in the City of Houston or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction This is something you may want to find out as soon as possible If it is outside the city limits is there already a MUD district in place to provide water and sewer services Since this is a brand new subdivision your concern regarding its future development and tax rate is very legitimate Usually until the subdivision is fairly well built out the Developer controls the Community Association as well as the Architectural Control Committee Therefore if this subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of the Developer We recommend in the strongest terms possible that you talk with recent customers of Flair Construction Co Inc to make sure that they were happy with the construction of their homes as well as warranty work Some Builders are far better than others as it relates to followup warranty work after their customers move into their homes We normally recommend that homeowners do not move into their homes until all punch list items are completed to the satisfaction of the homeowner The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract We will now make more specific comments and suggestions in chronological order regarding the Contract Paragraph PROPERTY As we previously stated we think it is important that you acquire copies of the Restrictive Covenants and Deed Restrictions as soon as possible You will be responsible to pay assessments to the Property Owners Association Since Flair is both the Builder and Developer you may want to ask Mr Kent for an estimate of what your Community Association Fees will be Paragraph EARNEST MONEY We suggest that the earnest money be paid to the Title Company and not to Flair Construction Co Inc Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY The standard printed exception as to discrepancies conflicts shortages in area or boundary lines encroachments or protrusions or overlapping improvements is in your Owners Policy In other words the title policy does not cover these types of discrepancies or conflicts However if a survey is completed and an additional fifteen percent of the policy premium is paid the title company will probably delete this exception This is something you may want to consider However this cost would be yours to incur If however it is subsequently discovered that there are such discrepancies and conflicts or shortages then you will have title insurance coverage accordingly Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY last paragraph Make sure you are provided a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance as soon as possible Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY B It appears to us that the only survey you will be provided with by the Seller is one for the new recorded plat of the subdivision Therefore the Seller is not providing you a survey of your actual lots If you were to have the standard printed exception as to discrepancies and conflicts deleted we believe you would need a survey of your lots You will have seven days after you receive the Commitment andor the survey to object in writing to any matters disclosed or you will be deemed to waive such objections accordingly Therefore please make sure that we have the opportunity to review the survey and commitment as soon as possible after you receive same Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY We agree that this paragraph relating to the Sellers right to continue to show the property for sale should be deleted Paragraph PROPERTY CONDITION B We suggest that this paragraph be checked and utilized rather than paragraph B which states that you will be accepting the property in its present condition Paragraph B states that you will pay a fee usually very small like for the unrestricted right to terminate the contract in the event the property is not suitable for the purposes for which you intend on using it In other words you can have whatever inspectors you deem necessary to look at the property to make sure that it is satisfactory for your home construction We often suggest that an independent inspector be hired by the homeowner to inspect and review the construction of the home as it progresses In addition there may be some environmental issues or soil condition questions that an inspector might raise if given the opportunity As the Contract now reads you are simply accepting the property as is and have no right to send an inspector out to the property accordingly Paragraph BROKERS FEES You may want an affirmative statement that you as the Buyer will not be responsible for or pay any Brokers fees Paragraph SPECIAL PROVISIONS It is written in that the closing on these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March whichever is later However we do not know what roads are being addressed and think that this sentence needs far more specificity The second sentence regarding your obligation to use Flair Homes has already been addressed earlier The third sentence regarding when construction must start should be revised to give you more time as you make reference in your letter However we also suggest that the Builder be put under an obligation to start construction within thirty days after the date you notify him that you are ready for construction to begin Paragraph ROLLBACK TAXES If there was ever an agricultural or timber exemption on this property you need to know Otherwise you will be obligated to pay rollback taxes on the property which may go back five years Paragraph ESCROW As we indicated earlier we believe your earnest money should be paid to the title company In light of the fact that the earnest money is in excess of and the closing date on the lots is somewhat uncertain we suggest that you ask the title company to deposit the earnest money in an interest bearing account and that you receive a credit accordingly Please call us after you read and review this letter Very truly yours Donald S Stirman DSScsb

BergsiekerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Mike CT Subject Oxy meeting We just finished the meeting with Dale Laurance and Casey Olson Heres a recap Oxy wanted to meet with Mike for two reasons Make sure Enron and Oxy had a project team in place asap and the resources are committed to do a world class job on the January submission and subsequent presentations As Mike noted we are in sudden death overtime and the th could be the end of the tournament Revisit the street talk about Enron redeploying capital Mike walked through the EGM organization talked about our stock multiple and how an announcement that we were putting huge dollars in Saudi would hurt our stock price Dale talked about their low multiple between and noted that the market viewed Oxy as a company that could do deals buy and sell assets but really wasnt a growth company They now have a stable cash flow but need a new beach head in the Middle East to demonstrate they are growing The point of this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being dumped into Saudi Arabia They characterized the Saudi perspective as being one where they are looking for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital They agree on a division of labor Oxy can do EP processing and petrochemicals and look to us for pipelines and power plants although Oxy can do those too They realize that only Enron has the marketing structuring and regulatory expertise Casey did revisit his conversation with you about in the end Enron ends up as some type of merchant banker Thats OK in the end Dale even said they would take over our part of any project but we cant project that role initially We need to be on the same side of the table as Oxy The point here is that we have to be in step with a consistent approach to the projects They expect our competitors to say theyll finance things on balance sheet and we need initially to say the same thing although later we will open discussions on other ways to finance Mike and I agree that this is probably the biggest sticking point in the discussion today Oxy believes that such an initial statement will never be public and we arent really locked in an onbalance sheet approach Maybe we can do this maybe we cant They see this as a year long process with PDAs stretching well into next year and when the real money would be spent The short term crisis is January and we need a submission with lots of pages we were criticized that although our proposal was well thought through and technically superb it didnt have enough pages reams of paper to impress the technocrats We will also need to prepare a smaller page digest to be used for our official February presentation and a three page walk around summary Casey thinks the production center has to be in the US We also all agreed that the Jan questions allow us to lay out all of our downstream concerns and establish a placeholder for issues that must be resolved during the PDA discussions before we would do a project I have had the greatest success around the world when we dont try to force immediately on a country a perfect gas or electric market but adapt to local conditions and implement the most important first couple of steps with the rest to follow later In this respect our projects can include suggested regulatory concepts that if successful can be used elsewhere in the Kingdom Over and over we came back to the project team which they want on the ground in Saudi Casey will be Saudi for the foreseeable future and can make all decisions Who will be our lead person with the same authority They dont want to deal with someone who later says Houston changed its mind a little arrogant When can we identify bodies and assignments and location They want full time dedicated people Either Dale or Casey noted that the old Enron would have parachuted a team in by now Like South America where we landed in a swamp and spent the next five years beating alligators over the head with a stick This is a very complicated political and technical effort The leader has to be good at both Casey was excited that Rob would be assigned to the project I guess you discussed this with him They both were quick to say that the working relationship to date has been excellent and that they appreciate the effort we have put into this Mike committed that we would go balls to the wall for the th deadline I committed that I would designate a project team by the first week in January we had our first conference call yesterday but Mike said he wanted to think about the decision point person and process we arent about to sacrifice a deliberative strategicconsensus thought process because they are in a hurry We spent a lot of time talking about the process We agree that the Saudis will eliminate one or two participants that each project will have subparts with different combinations and leads of companies with a master JV on top They minimized the capital investment although they are prepared to spent million over the next years They see core project costing million OxyEnron assuming one other partner and Enron half of that We arent talking billions spoken like a true major They are sure Exxon Mobil will be our Red Sea partner if only to earn face with possibly Marathon as the other Exxon is more interested in the chemical focus which Oxy will concede to them Mike noted was that our worst nightmare was a partner Exxon who would throw away money just to have a presence We were assured that Oxys only goal was to make money and if he projects didnt they would walk away The real danger in the upstream is the risk money for exploration Oxy hopes to hedge this risk with downstream investments pipelines and plants and hopes that if the exploration is successful and reserves are added it will lead to a whole new series of projects They are very proud of Oxys role in this claim that they were instrumental in getting Petry Parkman and Morgan selected as advisors that Irani is the most respected American Arab business man and has great access in the Kingdom and that they already know what investments partners are acceptable to the Saudis We all left great friends in good Christmas spirit From our perspective Saudi is the largest economy in the Middle east and the driver in international oil and liquids markets Enron needs to get inside and establish relationships with the key Saudi people We need a foot print in the Kingdom with which to earn their respect Can we do it with minimal capital investment Saudi is about to embark of a complete electric and gas restructuring regulatory included They want the repatriation of petro dollars and dollars held offshore by Saudi nationals The country can be a tremendous source of capital It looks like can be managed with a minimum burn rate with the most intense period of activity being in January We need to set up the team for the January effort Ill have this done by Jan There is the question of sorting out conflicts with other ME priorities Although it may be too soon to answer we dont know yet what is possible but we can shape that outcome what is the end game what do we want out of Saudi Arabia We seem to have a clear division of labor and strategy with Oxy although we need to sort out what we say about on balance sheet financing We also need to keep in mind that our other yet to be met partners will have a lot to say Oxy wants to take the lead on the Core Venture Red Sea I agree this is a perfect laboratory to address all of the market structure issues that will make the Kingdom a great place to do business Mike Im sure you can add more Rick its up to you if you want to send this around to the Saudi team Merry Christmas

NRONDEVELOPMENt Eric CT cc Subject Re Jose LNG Crude Pricing Per a conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the Houston office the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent on a year deal is NOT a possibility If we had of our GSA price linked to Brent our exposure for years would be about million barrels notional or about million barrels PV At our exposure would still be million notional or million PV According to John he would not be comfortable doing anything past and even out that far he would not consider doing more than about million PV barrels in the years Given these comments I would say that the size of our deal basically precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time As far as the economics of the deal are concerned we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to figure out our economics I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see if we could get a year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that the hedging costs would be too high and therefore have left it at that for the time being Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue Thanks Eric Guido NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Eric CT cc Emilio VicensENRON NRON CT Larry CT Cris CT Brent A CT Eric CT Daniel R RogersENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Jose LNG Offtake Comments Eric thanks for your comments Please see below in blue our observations and answers Lets talk later today if you have further questions Saludos Guido and Emilio Enron Offtake Agreement Section Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the EPC agreement Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers In addition it preserves your year offtake which should still match your GSA The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen that being the earlier of months after Financial Close or NTP or Dec We will add to this list the earlier of something like the date on which the plant has produced LNG at at least of its capacity for a period of consecutive days We suggest putting something like this as opposed to commercial hand over because this is in the plantscontractors control and they could for example on purpose not meet a noise level requirement for months for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project but we as offtakers can not wait for ever for the project to be completed with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow directly or indirectly under the projects control We have months limits to how much the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC or another EPC Contractor already built in Section I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of We agree that would be better but we included this section knowing that is something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA because they dont want us to sell down and then keep controlling new LNG businesses in Jose They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA We think that adding a restriction to the assets returns now in the draft will make it very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause Thus jeopardizing our chance to control the output of future plants or expansions We never intended to use these offtake agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes Nevertheless we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial control of the output Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will clearly realize what our intent is Section Where is the bonus calculation We did not include it now on purpose We will include it when ever they remind us to do so We want to have another fight about the bonus Where is the min price The minimum price is in We say that one of the terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number We are going to try to do it but that is first a GSA issue and we dont want to put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA We precisely bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we want to make it zero Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics No we dont have the definitive answer from structuring yet but our guess and based on our meeting with RAC the other day in which they told us about the mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba Brazil power plant we are pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not convenient But since we dont have a definitive answer yet we still included oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting that should have been bracketed in the termsheet though and it will Section you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate Is this your intent to have a mismatch Yes we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as offtaker and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if they do you have all new taxes being borne by the project company Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized See section of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue The exporter of record will be the project so the buyer has no business in Venezuela other than paying port fees We do not see any kind of taxes that could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred to the project Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that projects typically take all the time the heavy crude projects are some examples in Venezuela In addition the GSA provides for a number of reliefs for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel safer Although a large portion of the underlying risk is always there Other where are the LD calculations explained I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default GSA default should match LDs in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better New York law provides for full market based damages market price of commodity plus extra costs which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD clause So from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it as it is We are still discussing w Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is sellable to AA for MTM but our initial view is that it should be since the level of LD can not be better GSA default is market based provided that PDVSA as we expect accepts the change we will propose so the Project Company will be able to pay market based damages For interruption of gas supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being relieved from performance in such event this will obviously be to a maximum dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time say months we need time to give you precision on this but some sort of coverage will be available suppose the plant produces less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems not a FM issue at commercial hand over What happens under the offtake agreements Will the banks accept this revenue short fall Will we have to create a reserve This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry Under the offtake agreements the project pays market based damages if it does not meet the contracted volume We believe that the contracted volume that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks and equity holders to bear the risk We are contracting for contractually guaranteed production under the EPC which is lower than expected On top of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible meaning a lower LNG volume This volume is lower than the guaranteed production with Normal or expected feed composition Combining these two we have a contracted quantity that is lower than the expected production with expected feed On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least above what was expected mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs Also the EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equityholders whole They dont provide though for damages payable under offtake contracts nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs However as we explained we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co Banks will most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption as we already did What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is resolved what compensation do the offtakers get do the banks suffer here as well The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to determine failure to deliver by Seller It also establishes that deliveries should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant The bottom line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of defaults and price differentials It sets however a reasonable standard by which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur based on the reasonable constant deliveries provision damages will be payable based on prices during such month Yes banks suffer here to the extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable Nevertheless short periods weeks of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect the Project Company ability to pay the Banks It will have to be some prolonged period for Banks to be affected Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first days Will the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established Is this in your model We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard although we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected Our model assumes the cost of an LC for month debt service which should be plenty The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather damages not BI are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not permitted for MTM reasons The question that follows is if damages exceed the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its obligation to deliver have the damages have to be senior to debt payments for AA to allow MTM to be permitted If this is so are the banks going to be willing to live with this probably not insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling It is briefly covered in section second paragraph This will be expended in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to PDVSA insert termination section In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an offtaker than an asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law than if we try to right an early termination clause They point out also that of LNG contracts are done in this way having NY law rule the game They point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct

McConnellHOUECT Subject Re Jose LNG Crude Pricing Our ability in crude is apparently very poor What can J Wilson do thru I want the crude desk to make us a price and present an acceptable volume If we have to suggest to PDVSA only doing a crude index through I strongly believe we should try if we can create some additional value thru this structure Tell me if you would like me to give him a call to explain what the effort potentially create Thanks Eric Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Eric Groves To Guido CarantiENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Emilio VicensENRON NRONDEVELOPMENt Eric CT cc Subject Re Jose LNG Crude Pricing Per a conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the Houston office the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent on a year deal is NOT a possibility If we had of our GSA price linked to Brent our exposure for years would be about million barrels notional or about million barrels PV At our exposure would still be million notional or million PV According to John he would not be comfortable doing anything past and even out that far he would not consider doing more than about million PV barrels in the years Given these comments I would say that the size of our deal basically precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time As far as the economics of the deal are concerned we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to figure out our economics I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see if we could get a year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that the hedging costs would be too high and therefore have left it at that for the time being Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue Thanks Eric Guido NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Eric CT cc Emilio VicensENRON NRON CT Larry CT Cris CT Brent A CT Eric CT Daniel R RogersENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Jose LNG Offtake Comments Eric thanks for your comments Please see below in blue our observations and answers Lets talk later today if you have further questions Saludos Guido and Emilio Enron Offtake Agreement Section Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the EPC agreement Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers In addition it preserves your year offtake which should still match your GSA The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen that being the earlier of months after Financial Close or NTP or Dec We will add to this list the earlier of something like the date on which the plant has produced LNG at at least of its capacity for a period of consecutive days We suggest putting something like this as opposed to commercial hand over because this is in the plantscontractors control and they could for example on purpose not meet a noise level requirement for months for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project but we as offtakers can not wait for ever for the project to be completed with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow directly or indirectly under the projects control We have months limits to how much the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC or another EPC Contractor already built in Section I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of We agree that would be better but we included this section knowing that is something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA because they dont want us to sell down and then keep controlling new LNG businesses in Jose They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA We think that adding a restriction to the assets returns now in the draft will make it very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause Thus jeopardizing our chance to control the output of future plants or expansions We never intended to use these offtake agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes Nevertheless we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial control of the output Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will clearly realize what our intent is Section Where is the bonus calculation We did not include it now on purpose We will include it when ever they remind us to do so We want to have another fight about the bonus Where is the min price The minimum price is in We say that one of the terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number We are going to try to do it but that is first a GSA issue and we dont want to put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA We precisely bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we want to make it zero Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics No we dont have the definitive answer from structuring yet but our guess and based on our meeting with RAC the other day in which they told us about the mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba Brazil power plant we are pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not convenient But since we dont have a definitive answer yet we still included oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting that should have been bracketed in the termsheet though and it will Section you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate Is this your intent to have a mismatch Yes we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as offtaker and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if they do you have all new taxes being borne by the project company Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized See section of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue The exporter of record will be the project so the buyer has no business in Venezuela other than paying port fees We do not see any kind of taxes that could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred to the project Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that projects typically take all the time the heavy crude projects are some examples in Venezuela In addition the GSA provides for a number of reliefs for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel safer Although a large portion of the underlying risk is always there Other where are the LD calculations explained I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default GSA default should match LDs in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better New York law provides for full market based damages market price of commodity plus extra costs which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD clause So from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it as it is We are still discussing w Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is sellable to AA for MTM but our initial view is that it should be since the level of LD can not be better GSA default is market based provided that PDVSA as we expect accepts the change we will propose so the Project Company will be able to pay market based damages For interruption of gas supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being relieved from performance in such event this will obviously be to a maximum dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time say months we need time to give you precision on this but some sort of coverage will be available suppose the plant produces less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems not a FM issue at commercial hand over What happens under the offtake agreements Will the banks accept this revenue short fall Will we have to create a reserve This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry Under the offtake agreements the project pays market based damages if it does not meet the contracted volume We believe that the contracted volume that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks and equity holders to bear the risk We are contracting for contractually guaranteed production under the EPC which is lower than expected On top of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible meaning a lower LNG volume This volume is lower than the guaranteed production with Normal or expected feed composition Combining these two we have a contracted quantity that is lower than the expected production with expected feed On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least above what was expected mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs Also the EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equityholders whole They dont provide though for damages payable under offtake contracts nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs However as we explained we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co Banks will most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption as we already did What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is resolved what compensation do the offtakers get do the banks suffer here as well The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to determine failure to deliver by Seller It also establishes that deliveries should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant The bottom line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of defaults and price differentials It sets however a reasonable standard by which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur based on the reasonable constant deliveries provision damages will be payable based on prices during such month Yes banks suffer here to the extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable Nevertheless short periods weeks of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect the Project Company ability to pay the Banks It will have to be some prolonged period for Banks to be affected Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first days Will the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established Is this in your model We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard although we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected Our model assumes the cost of an LC for month debt service which should be plenty The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather damages not BI are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not permitted for MTM reasons The question that follows is if damages exceed the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its obligation to deliver have the damages have to be senior to debt payments for AA to allow MTM to be permitted If this is so are the banks going to be willing to live with this probably not insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling It is briefly covered in section second paragraph This will be expended in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to PDVSA insert termination section In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an offtaker than an asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law than if we try to right an early termination clause They point out also that of LNG contracts are done in this way having NY law rule the game They point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct

Katy CT Vance NRON John AmblerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Juiced ComputerWorld Juiced By Julia King and Gary H Anthes Nov Wall Street analysts and oil industry executives were thick among the legion of skeptics who thought Enron Corp President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling was nuts to launch a Web site for the trading of natural gas and electricity over the Internet That was last November before EnronOnline locked up more than billion in transactions in its first few months of operation quickly establishing itself as the worlds largest ecommerce company As of Oct just prior to Enrons report of its thirdquarter earnings EnronOnline had executed more than transactions representing a gross value of billion Since then the billion Houstonbased energy giant has elbowed its way into several new diversified markets And it plans to continue its push into many more ranging from railcar cargo space to broadband networking and datastorage capacity In doing so Enron is turbocharging its transformation from a stodgy oldline fuel company to an entirely new kind of businesstobusiness market maker with information technology and an allout emphasis on entrepreneurship at the heart of its New Economy operations Enron has been so successful in leveraging IT to pioneer new markets that others are trying to emulate its approach First to Market Enron often introduces a product before the competition even senses a market exists the company says in its latest annual report A prime example online trading of datanetwork capacity Indeed theres a low degree of awareness among carriers about the bandwidthtrading business and Enron is ahead of the game says Seth Libby an analyst at The Yankee Group in Boston At present there are only a handful of network professionals who are aware of these capacity commoditization plans says Libby But not for long asserts Enron President Jeff Skilling Within five years the bandwidth market may be bigger than the gas and electric markets he says So for us it could be as big as the rest of our existing energy business Thats currently a billion business But critics say trading bandwidth is much more complicated than trading gas especially for a company with little depth in telecommunications And critics add that although carriers stand to benefit from the ability to buy and sell capacity they might prefer to do it through some channel thats independent of the control of a single market maker like Enron Enrons argument is that its trading capabilities are the differentiator and that it need not have deep telecom expertise says Lisa Pierce an analyst at Giga Information Group in Stamford Conn But Im not convinced its that simple Technology isnt a longterm competitive differentiator Houstonbased Enron Broadband Services Inc formed last year offers IP transport on its mile fiberoptic network Enron Broadband Services also trades that is makes a market by buying and selling network capacity to and from other data carriers conducting some of the transactions on EnronOnline Enron Broadband Services also offers contentoriented services such as a videoondemand service it will market with Dallasbased Blockbuster Inc to home viewers starting next month When we started the gas business they told us we were nuts Skilling says They said Youre going to sell gas but not own production How does that work Then we did electricity and they said we were nuts again and even louder than before They said this stuff moves at the speed of light you can never create a market Then in telecommunications they said we were nuts again Despite its share of skeptics some experts like Enrons prospects in this space I think aspects of this have the potential to be very big says Libby The carriers like the idea of instantaneous provisioning And I think it has a lot of potential for selling it to businesses and giving them the ability to cut their costs significantly by buying it as they need it We aspire to that kind of model says Fred Buehler director of electronic business at Eastman Chemical Co in Kingsport Tenn In every sector there will be one or two innovators who get out front and do things differently to create shareholder value Buehler says Were trying to be one of them Market Maker Stroll through the gastrading section on the nd floor of Enrons glistening story headquarters and the companys technological sophistication is immediately evident Traders like yearold John Arnold who personally executes about billion per day in trades have realtime access to virtually any information that might affect their splitsecond buyandsell decisions That information might be a meteorologists prediction of a colderthannormal winter across the Plains states or a live news report of political instability in an oilproducing country in the Middle East Behind the scenes all of Arnolds trades are instantly analyzed and processed by a sophisticated proprietary riskmanagement system and then updated across multiple backend computer systems worldwide Less than a year after launching the operation of the worlds gas is traded on EnronOnline What we are doing no one in the industry did years ago Eighty percent of our income this year is from businesses that didnt exist years ago says Skilling For example EnronOnline contributed heavily to its parent companys thirdquarter earnings which were up to million compared with the same period last year The change is technologydriven Skilling adds We couldnt do what we do without massive amounts of computing capability In this regard Enron joins a short list of companies that includes WalMart Stores Inc FedEx Corp and American Airlines Inc which famously pioneered various missioncritical IT techniques to leapfrog competitors and create a whole new class of ITenabled industry leaders Among Enrons boldest ideas is its use of a single powerful softwarebased trading platform to insert itself as a principal buyer or seller in hundreds of different markets Currently Enron trades more than different commodities such as gold natural gas and metals on EnronOnline The core of our business is our business model which is a centralized riskmanagement and marketmaking business model It just so happens that the Internet is just perfect for improving the efficiency of that model Skilling says But as a market maker EnronOnline stands alone For starters unlike most other Internet marketplaces its free There are no transaction fees or catalog inventory or subscription costs for users Enron has broken away from the pack in the last year in terms of their capital growth says Ian Wylie vice president of ebusiness at BP Amoco PLC in London And ebusiness is responsible for a lot of this change Even more unusual is Enrons role as a principal in each transaction That means Enron is either the buyer or seller in every trade in which its involved unlike market makers that simply act as matchmakers between buyers and sellers In fact Skilling as well as Mike McConnell who heads EnronOnlines global expansion efforts as president and CEO of Enron Global Markets LLC dismisses much of the current hyperactivity surrounding other feebased businesstobusiness exchanges as a flash in the pan Many of the BB guys think all you have to do is set up a bulletin board and people will start transacting but it doesnt work that way Skilling says You need to know you can deliver if push comes to shove As either the seller or buyer in all of its trades Enron an established brand name with miles of pipeline and deep financial pockets guarantees delivery or payment on all trades that are executed on EnronOnline Were creating markets that were highly illiquid so someone has to put their reputation on the line to say Well deliver Skilling says But guaranteeing delivery also requires having guaranteed access to physical assets such as network bandwidth and papermaking plants Guaranteed access also ensures marketplace liquidity For Enron this is where the bricks and mortar come in For example to help drive its liquidity in the pulp and paper market Enron paid million in July for Garden State Paper Co a recyclednewsprint mill in Garfield NJ Skillings current market fancy is metals and in May Enron bought MG PLC a Londonbased metals marketer You have to break the liquidity logjam and to do that you have to take a risk position Skilling says But once the logjam is cleared Enron is just as likely to sell off the brickandmortar assets it acquired and use the cash to invest in new business For example to finance its new bandwidthtrading operation Enron is selling Portland General Electric Co a Portland Orebased power producer that it bought in so it could bring liquidity to and guarantee trades in the online electricity market Eventually Enron may end up trading commodities that arent even considered commodities at least not at the moment such as data storage capacity or empty railcar space Might we move into sauces or meats or grains Potentially says McConnell who was Enrons de facto CIO before moving into his current role You have to be creative every day McConnell says You have to be openminded to trying new things But what remains constant throughout all the upsizing and downsizing is Enrons core ITenabled business model which is what puts it in a class of its own analysts say People have talked a lot about systems that theyre about to roll out but there is just not much out there for direct trading says Mike Heim an energy analyst at AG Edwards Sons Inc in St Louis Enron rolled out its technology months ago and still there isnt much else out there There hasnt been much competition because there isnt anybody in the same class But just last month Houstonbased Dynegy Inc launched Dynegydirect an Internetbased commissionfree trading site for energy and communications commodities Also last month IntercontinentalExchange in Atlanta whose partners include BP Amoco and The Haguebased Royal DutchShell Group added natural gas and power to its online trading system which already included precious metals and crude oil Skilling doesnt get called nuts much anymore In fact hes a darling on Wall Street where Enrons stock has soared from around per share last November to as of this Nov As a result Enron by all accounts an Old Economy gas pipeline company until months ago is widely regarded as a New Economy pioneer Says Skilling We like to say we were BB before there was BB Thriving On the Unconventional As head of two Enron pipeline subsidiaries Mike McConnell knew a lot more about gas flows than he did about data flows last year when he got a surprise call from Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling Recalls McConnell Jeff went into this whole thought process about how the Internet is changing everything He said We need to make Enron an ebusiness and I need a guy that can run this as a business We need to change the way we view technology I thought he was a little crazy and I said Jeff Im not a technology person at all He said No seriously this is going to be big So I took over as CEO of Enron Global Technology and thus became the companys de facto CIO McConnell explains Appointing a person with no technology background to the top IT post is an unusual move But Enron often defies convention and typically thrives as a result Indeed Enron boasts an entrepreneurial culture thats unusual in large longestablished companies and in utilities firms in particular McConnell relates the tale of how yearold Louise Kitchen Enrons head gas trader in Europe spearheaded the creation of an online gastrading system recruiting IT people from elsewhere in the company to do the development work Word of the Webbased platform EnronOnline which is literally remaking the company didnt reach top management until a few weeks before it went live Kitchen enlisted the support of Enrons initially skeptical top traders and she scoured the company for software developers and other experts Her small army of volunteers worked nights and weekends on the project while carrying on with their regular jobs Its an amazing story about not getting corporate approval and going through all the bureaucracy McConnell says No one went to the board and said We want to change the way we trade You just do it Glowing Endorsement Soon after McConnell became the de facto CIO of the billion energy company he joined eight of Sun Microsystems Incs top Houston customers at a breakfast hosted by Sun CEO Scott McNealy I was very nervous recalls McConnell I mean McNealy is the guy and here I know nothing about technology Id been on the job maybe two weeks McNealy asked the attendees all but McConnell were middleaged CIOs with many years of IT experience to introduce themselves in turn When Scott came to me I said Im the CEO of Global Technology and we want to be the leader in BB commerce in the world He kind of sat back and said How long have you been in the IT business McConnell explains About nine days I said and we are going to take a little bit different approach to technology Scott chuckled and said That sounds like Enron it always looks at things differently He then stated that my CEO title and Enrons approach were very unusual but that it would be more commonplace soon as this was the way of the future McConnell says McNealys endorsement had a huge impact on how he structured IT at Enron during the following year I realized that we werent too late to change our approach and take a commercial view of technology he says a view of IT as an integral part of the business not as something that supports business functions None of the other companies were thinking our new way at all Taking a commercial view of IT has led to a blurring of the line that traditionally separates IT organizations from the business units they support When McConnell became CEO of Global Technology Enron had five CIOs who were predominantly operating independently inside the companys major lines of business Each CIO had his own agenda his own thought process his own goals and they did not communicate at all he says McConnell established corporate standards for IT created a management team that included the five CIOs and put all IT people under a new chief technology officer Philippe Bibi But IT is far from centralized at Enron We wanted to make people think about technology not as IT and support but as an extension of your business he explains So we seeded people out into the business units IT directs the performance review process but the business units have the greatest influence on where the person actually ranks and is rated Firms like Enron that merge IT departments with the business units they serve will be the winners among fastpaced ebusinesses says IT organization expert Robert Zawacki president of Zawacki and Associates in Colorado Springs and a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado also in Colorado Springs We need more entrepreneurial leaders in IT and McConnell is certainly one he says IT makes it easier to be entrepreneurial says McConnell who is now president and CEO of Enron Global Markets We really do like to try things and see what happens and when you have an electronic platform like EnronOnline that we can model into different sectors its very inexpensive to try it We are not afraid if its not working well just stop Gary H Anthes and Julia King

thanks for all of the support in the placement of the former CALME employees We are done to just a very few at this time It appears that your new squad is getting some traction on building the LNG business Im pleased to hear that I look forward to hearing how our transportation or logistics business is developing Perhaps we can get together sometime during the San Antonio conference to catch up All the best Shawn PS the following is an interesting article about the online intermodal landscape Hashing Out Ecommerce JOHN GALLAGHER Traffic World Page Copyright Gale Group Inc All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Journal of Commerce Inc Dotcoms explain how they hope to compete in intermodal market and among themselves With some websites devoted to transportation ecommerce companies acknowledge that its difficult for potential customers to cut through the confusion and figure out whos doing what and whos going to be with them for the long term Because of the competition between their respective railroad partners one of the bigger questions for intermodal shippers is the relationship between Arzoon and Freightwise There has been speculation that after Freightwise was established by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway four competitors Union Pacific Railroad Norfolk Southern CSX and Canadian Pacific Railway teamed up with rival ecommerce site Arzoon in a response to BNSFs proposed merger with Canadian National Railway However both Freightwise and Arzoon claim thats not the case Im continually asked Whats up with the four railroads and Arzoon said Charley Eisele UP senior vice president strategic planning People are trying to make a whole lot out of the coincidence of these two things from a timing perspective The reality is it was a decision made on the underlying business model Freightwise executives agree with that assessment pointing out that because the industry happened to be divided along merger lines at the same time the railroads were aligning with ecommerce initiatives it seemed too much of a coincidence that the same four railroads opposing the merger were the ones joining Arzoon However I think to launch a company like this takes more than just a reaction to a merger said Freightwise Chief Marketing Officer Sanjay Joshi There are major differences between the two Internet companies starting with their business plans Arzoon categorizes itself as a shippercentric transportation management system whose target market is the roughly percent of the transportation business that currently moves under contract Freightwise on the other hand classifies itself as a transportation exchange and is targeting the remaining percent of the market procured on a spot basis Arzoon whose primary focus is the shipper is setting out to help manage the relationships that already exist between shipper and carrier The priority for carrierfocused Freightwise is to make sure the capacity is there for shippers who log on to their system In addition Arzoon which currently is involved only with rail and truck wants eventually to become a transportation management system that manages across all modes and borders including ocean and air freight said Eisele Freightwise will stick to truckload and intermodal for the time being Were not sure about getting involved with air freight given the size of the market and the economics said Joshi It takes a different set of products and economics than surface transportation Maybe sometime down the line but right now we really plan on getting entrenched in the truckload and intermodal spot market We think thats a lot to chew The key is to focus on a particular footprint that we can begin to own rather than get too broad and lose focus The fact that Arzoon and Freightwise have teamed up with different rail carriers is another cause for concern Will there be a disincentive on the part of carriers to use each others ecommerce initiatives and ultimately therefore a disadvantage for prospective customers The answer is the rule said a source from an Arzoon rail partner A particular shipper is in a position where percent of their business is conducted via truck and other modes and maybe only percent via railroads If the choice presented to them is to select a system that addresses all modes effectively or one that only addresses a particular mode then the rule would suggest that greater leverage would lie in picking the broader multimode transportation management system In that case even though a railroad may have another ecommerce approach it would clearly have to respond to the customers needs in that situation Freightwises Joshi makes a similar argument Freightwise is merely another channel for BNSF to market its services he said It posts a certain set of rates for what it believes to be fair for the service Its not for Freightwise to decide what rates BNSF decides to move through its channel UP may not decide to post its rates on Freightwise Joshi said so then BNSF would have to find out whats the competitive rate relative to UP Another question arises as to whether Arzoon may have a competitive advantage over Freightwise particularly from an intermodal standpoint because it is backed by both Eastern and Western carriers whereas Freightwise is backed only by BNSF I would only say that the partnership we have with BNSF is not exclusive and that were talking to other railroads as well Joshi noted He added This is an exchange to market your capacity and services It would be very difficult for six railroads to do something on their own there would be no critical mass Its to the advantage of the other railroads to participate Along with BNSF which provides Freightwise with instant capacity the company recently signed GE Corp as an anchor tenant and equity investor that will help Freightwise reach the critical mass Joshi talks about As both a major supplier to the rail industry locomotives and a potential shipper appliances the goal is to use GE as something we can leverage and work with their respective divisions as a way to reduce their transportation costs he said Visibility is a key advantage for potential customers of both Interment companies As a transportation management system with access to all modes it allows shippers to be more efficient in the management of transportation Eisele said Crossmodal visibility means that because theyll be managing their truck business under the same system as rail the economics of rail will be much more visible And we believe that with comparable reliability the economics will be compelling to the point where rails will garner a greater share of those customers total transportation buy Joshi claims a big difference between Freightwise and other exchanges is that when a shipper is looking for transportation options between specific origindestination pairs Freightwise allows customers to make sidebyside comparisons between truck and intermodal It is this price and service transparency Joshi says that will save its customers money Were giving customers three to five choices between truck and intermodal not so that they can see service and price parameters Intermodal ecommerce ventures such as Freightwise also bring up the question of competition with traditional intermodal marketing companies Joshi points out that its fee for doing a lot of what small and midsize IMCs do currently such as load matching tracking and tracing and order processing is percent which is split between the buyer and seller of the services This compares to the to percent that customers traditionally have paid for retaining an IMC I dont think all brokers will embrace us Joshi conceded but at the same time there will be a segment of brokers who will begin migrating into higheraddedvalue services for example the thirdparty logistics side rather than the classical brokerage Theyll get into things like inventory management on behalf of shippers and leave backend processing to firms like Freightwise Webmodal which is a purely intermodal ecommerce venture whose vision is to make intermodal much more like truck in the eyes of the shipper points out that it can take customers several days to receive a bid from a traditional IMC We can immediately configure door to door intermodal solutions that we can put together using our underlying carrier relationships said Webmodal founder and CEO Chris Kravas We do business with a lot of large US railroads and with drayage companies We give everybody access to all the information they might need to make decisions on price vs service tradeoffs and which carriers make most sense based on what the shipper is trying to do And we do it without the traditional onetothreeday wait that typically happens in response to a normal request for intermodal services Kravas said the company has invested time and expertise in developing what it calls a firstever schedule engine that works door to door Traditionally the industry hasnt had a schedule engine that involves the drayplusrailplusdray services so theres been pretty much a reliance on rules of thumb But the truth is it doesnt take anywhere near eight days for most origindestination pairs We have a very robust way of representing the capabilities of the dray carriers as well as the rail carriers so that much more trucklike transit can be shown to be viable Because of this Webmodal sees itself as more of a technology and ecommerce company than a traditional IMC and considers itself more a vendor than a competitor How does a small or midsize IMC work as a customer of Webmodal Not all small IMCs are set up to do business with all of the railroads or with a large set of drayage companies Kravas said What we do for them is give them a lowcost way to access a comprehensive array of intermodal products and services available in the US Weve established ourselves as a business partner with a large base of firstrate drayage companies across the country So if youre an IMC with an opportunity to handle freight in a new market Webmodal allows you to put together a service and pay only a modest fee Kravas wouldnt disclose the companys fee structure only that it charges per shipment for a webbased order and a slightly higher fee for a phone or fax order A smaller IMC also could use Webmodal to put in place a private version of its technology that would enable the IMC to better manage its business That would range from pricing order fulfillment customer service kind of the whole spectrum of capabilities that would allow an IMC to take advantage of our system Kravas said Everyones waiting to see whos going to survive the transportation dotcom fallout Before that happens however Freightwise may find itself as big a competitor with Arzoon as it is with a company like Webmodal Were starting from different points said Freightwises Joshi but down the line yes I can see more headtohead competition between the two companies In

last couple of days and I understand that OU has a different recruiting schedule then other schools Enron is on campus for recruiting in the near future a nd I have asked Sally to tag on some interviews for summer interns while on th at trip I believe that she has been able to schedule this so I believe that from an OU perspective it may be a mute point now Doing that should be ab le to maintain the momentum that we have developed at OU and all the work Lexi has done By the way the recruiting trip a couple of weeks ago was very successful If you have any other questions or comments please let me know mike Charlene NRON AM To Sally CT cc Celeste CT Richard NRON Mike CT Subject Re Hiring Practices for Summer Interns Sally Thanks for the email regarding summer interns I apologize that Lexi and Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking I wis h that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin g difficulty I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any member of my staff was not responsive That being said please allow me to explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set it You are absolutely correct It is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge As you are aware over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm Brecker Merryman who has assisted us in a number of different mark et research projects However in my opinion this issue is not one that required much research I have been involved in recruiting in some way shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past years Most major organizations with the exception of the Accounting firm s begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring There are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date particularly in the MBA programs For example Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until January As indicated the firms that generally recrui t in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for spring internships The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns Presentations were made in January February and offers were made in February and March The only school that did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope We did of course recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enrons ability to hire quality s ummer interns This past summer Enron had summer Analysts undergraduate and summer Associates graduate We intentionally limited the number of summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful assignments Approximately of these individuals received permanent offers to join Enron The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire undergraduates for summer positions They generally focus on MBAs particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enrons competitors Because the undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have continued to have a special focus on these individuals ie the reason the re were undergraduates and only MBAs With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about which you raised a concern let me address your concerns In your email y ou indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU You did not howeve r provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU While OU has not gotten back to her following is the information obtained from UT o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson o According to Cindy approximately of companies actively recruiting on campus conduct interviews in the fall for summer internships Cindy attributes this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring or in the case of Andersen Consulting have a tremendous need and conduct all interviews at one time o In conclusion Cindy estimated that of companies actively recruiting on campus recruit in the spring for summer internships We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t he statistics at this time I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such information It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably different than what we were told If you would provide the name of the individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for the discrepancies While I understand your concern with respect to OU they appear to be different than most of the other schools at which we recruit If you belie ve that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are supportive however because Lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently As you are aware in most instances the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early August If you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts I hope this has been helpful I can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager Again I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i f you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance Charlene

leads This essentially reflects what I hope you already know that your HR lead support is ENA Me with Sheila Knudsen I ultimately hope Cindy Skinner will move to take this lead sometime next year EGM Cindy Skinner and Shanna Funkhouser We believe Shanna will develop to lead this in the next months EIM Me and Fran Mayes the plan would be for Fran to eventually take lead on this when she is ready Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns David TO ALL ENA HR CC Olson Delainey Lavorato Frevert McMahon Bowen McConnell Shankman R Jones MBarnard MJoyce DLynch BVanCleve From Oxley Western Hemisphere Wholesale Energy HR Group Organisation Change When we launched our HR Franchise Team structure in February this year we did so with the commitment to continually refine and challenge ourselves to ensure we were optimising the resources we have available to help our businesses achieve and exceed their goals In fact you will recall in communicating the changes in February we actually highlighted what we anticipated would be a need to make further refinements and changes to maximise our effectiveness A great deal has happened in these last months and I am delighted that the Franchise team concept has contributed so much towards our far greater partnership with our individual business groups and our own outlook priorities and objectives We truly have revolutionised how we provide HR services and advice More importantly the business has recognised us for the huge progress we have made to date This success is an outstanding achievement and one that I hope you join me in being extremely proud of As is always the case at Enron continuous change is the norm and so as to illustrate this point quite effectively the businesses previously part of ENA have over the last months essentially been split into three Enron Global Markets set up to focus on the Global Fuels markets which were previously part of Enron Europe and CALME Coal Financial Tarding and InsuranceWeather which were all previously part of ENA EGM is now led by Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman Enron Industrial Markets set up to focus on the Industrial markets and expand our activities across new Industrial sectors which will build on the success of the Paper Pulp and Lumber business previously part of ENA and immediately develop a steel market EIM is led by Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen Enron North America remains the largest of these three businesses even after these changes and will now focus all of its efforts on the highly successful Gas and Power markets in North America including Canada and Mexico ENA continues to be led by Dave Delainey and John Lavorato Mark Frevert following his return from Europe has been instrumental in the restructuring of these businesses and is Chairman of each of these as well as Enron Europe which collectively now constitute Enrons entire activities in the Wholesale commodity markets These changes in the businesses we support clearly force us to reexamine the HR business model and adjust our strategy accordingly Fortunately our flexible organisation structure lends itself extremely well to realign along these new business lines and as such the changes illustrated below in the attached org chart are far easier for us to make than they might otherwise have been In addition given the immense value and positive client feedback we have received on our efforts to concentrate our HR resources on Franchise skill lines this also provides us with an opportunity to reinforce and refine our efforts in developing market intelligence employment propositions compensation ideas and best practices as well as the innovatively sourced talent pipelines in each of these areas to proactively provide our clients with a competitive advantage I believe the changes outlined on the attached org chart are self explanatory however if you have any questions please feel free to raise them either with your team leads or me Given that we have a staff meeting scheduled for Friday I would plan to walk through these changes with you and answer any questions at that time Finally to reinforce our goals and prepare you all for the next months I would like to underline the overall commitment to continue to change and flex our resources to anticipate meet and exceed our businesses needs This will clearly mean further organisation changes as we move forward This is not Change for changes sake but change and our ability to change quickly and as often as necessary is essential for us to remain a competitive and effective HR resource for our clients

Noncompetition I would appreciate if you would check with your CEOCOO regarding this email and respond to me by Friday September if you have questions or concerns Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions that bind Enron affiliates by Monday October Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific Enron Asia PacificAfricaChina Enron APACHI is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company Newco Newco would be charged with making the shareholders investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders respective stakes in Newco The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a dumping ground for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia As a result Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the MarubeniEnron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates The following is a summary of these competition provisions Enron affiliates with the exceptions stated below could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region as defined below after first offering the opportunity to Newco If Newco declines the opportunity Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction OM offtaker or risk management services There are a number of exceptions to this rule a small projects involving MW or less b projects in which Enron owns less than a interest c projects initiated by our SK joint venture d Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron e projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than of the value of the acquisition and f situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction Affiliates will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publiclyowned eg Azurix Asia Pacific Region will be defined to include Brunei China including Hong Kong and Macau South Korea North Korea Taiwan Vietnam Laos Cambodia Thailand Myanmar the Philippines Malaysia Indonesia East Timor Singapore Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands including Guam Saipan the Federated States of Micronesia and Fiji but excluding Hawaii It does not include Japan and Australia The competition clause would survive until the earlier of a Enron selling its interest in Newco or b December Thank you Bruce Lundstrom General Counsel Enron APACHI

Enrons will be split to Enron and new investor Any changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC which is heavily influenced but not controlled by Enron The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA and Enron has this through Metgas Under the TARA Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that Metgas delivers to DPC In addition Metgas has rights to increase size of terminal at its cost So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real value here Today Metgas is owned and controlled by Enron so Enron has control But in any sale of Metgas Enrons control will be lessened Under current plans to avoid debt consolidation we will reduce Enrons equity position to or less which means we are at best sharing control with someone else or maybe a group of someone elses

collages to create abstract color compositions The dense smooth colors and clearcut shapes created a totally new artistic language for him It was in seeking to extend this concept that he began under the encouragement of the publisher Teriade to experiment with using t he same types of form created through stencil printing At first he used cut stencil shapes linked to lithography and then move to using the stencils with pochoir color for this removed problem of lithography diluting the col or intensity Matisses project was to create an album titled Jazz forms expressed through a brilliant highly emotional purity of vibrant color The first trials were made using lithography and it was in this connection that the Icarus composition above was issued by Teriade in Verve as a form of

Mike CT cc Jeffrey CT Greg Whalley Subject Re ClickPapercom First thanks for jumping in on this I am confident we can get it done even though it will be a fire drill We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there it was just being held or managed in four places It will all be pulled together by Monday in one place one complete document and will have about major categories with specific tasks under each category with status person responsible comments and date to be completed It will also have a complete timeline We can review that Monday and agree on its content Louise agreed to review it as well As it relates to the people you mentioned let me know how andor who you want to pull in after we agree on the control document That way we will know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them Salley Beck called she mentioned you had called her as well and we agreed that the ClickPapers back office representative would officially be Scott Earnest he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with him for months She is going to get in place people to be our Product Control Group for CP launch on July th Scott and Salley will work to source it so that we have or people trained and ready on the th to receive password applications create customer profiles on ClickPaper and start the applications through credit legal and tax and finally get out user IDs to clients We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their people unless there is some emergency Remember we are only setting up people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified We also have a help desk person starting next week I dont have his name yet but we have him and one more on the way We will create for them a brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave We walked inch by inch through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done We have a few holes but it is not that far away She is going to think about a process document for this and get back to me Monday I have a detailed EOL one and we will give it our shot this weekend Let me know what Mark Palmer says He knows we have been using Margaret We will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan and what she needs to do We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive mailing a letter that does not include temporary IDspasswords We will tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers we want to use this time to get them preregistered Besides there is no way to test a temporary IDs anyway We will send those out later as I said earlier the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area or garden as Lousie would call it by next for Friday or the following Monday That way people can surf the content and get registered On legal I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we had a detailed discussion today about the contracts what is needed and the deadline There is legal work left to do the current draft of the password application doesnt work but if Taylor can help that would be great We will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy with Bob Crane and Hal as well to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control issues associated with it Credit is fine we have been working with Bradford for months but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual posting I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and views The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all their comments by the end of next week They will also be given the complete Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to help the roll out We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday July nd for the final testing of the system Remember the th is a one Enrontomany launch with a financial market only ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section Enron is so it is simply a new distribution channel for Enrons existing financial offering Later we will build it out for physical probably sooner rather than later Finally I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop but Louise said today that is October or November It will only be manytomany if someone comes in and makes a compelling case to do so Thanks See you tomorrow GP To Greg nron cc Subject ClickPapercom Greg a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Mondays meeting I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines personnel responsibilities and key action items I think this is another good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and assignments Andrew Parsons Sr Director and superior performer is a great and very smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort You will like him and he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team even if it is for a couple of weeks He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform He has others on his team that could help and Ive asked him to think about his existing AA resources that are available some are working on ClickPaper already Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the short run Beth Pearlman John Tollefson IT Bob Schultz LK said she could spare him without delaying phase roll out Dave Forester not a good option because it would definitely set back phase roll out Mary Solmenson Scott Mills Berry Pearce David Port David Sweeny Sally Beck advice and discuss additional resources I did ask Louise to jump in and i know you did too to help on some quick thoughts on process and lessons learned I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they or the simplified early versions are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper I went by to see Mark Palmer he was out and left him a voice mail on the marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing I wanted him to make sure that he understood the importance and priority of this effort I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out or assigning John Tollefson and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday afternoon Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to add a trading perspective A few thoughts see you tomorrow mike

emphasized during my recent trips to South America Japan and Korea Overall the trips were definitely worth the effort and each business unit n ow truly gets the ENW story and what we are attempting to accomplish The efforts over the past months are really beginning to pay dividends This is not meant to be a complete laundry list of all the important issues and discussed topics but rather a briefing of a few top priorities and items fo r each group Enron South America I met with the entire management team as a group in Rio at an ESA board meeting and most of the key individuals separately Sugar coffee and orange juice were new commodities that were brought up by numerous groups as consideration for new ENW efforts due to their desirable market characteristics Pulp and Paper additional activity has already begun and is currently bei ng worked with Greg Piper I believe that this is the best and shortterm opportunity out there Metals and mining is big in South America This was also brought up frequently and I told DArcy Carroll that we would get back to them upon further closure of MG and that this could move quickly up the food chain bu t not to focus as top priority yet DArcy former Cargill trader has strong connections at Cargill and believes that we can go in compete and capture their markets He also has several candidates and resumes which have been sent to Robert Jones for consideration for trading positions for our new agriculture trading activities Greg I will forward to you also I dont believe I sent them to you DArcy and Steve Nagy are putting together more of a business plan for the rest of with regard to commercial opportunities I have been pleased to date with Steve and his initial functions as a technology origination role but it is time to put some tangible goals and results on the table Dan Bruce VP international infrastructure is going to focus more time o n ESA Philippe and I are in the process of finalizing Regional VPs and focusing Dan to this region this is not finalized yet They need serious help in their trading systems and more senior support overall Will wait until decision made on Project California Enron Japan Joe is building an impressive team and he has a thorough and well thought o ut business plan Japan has the opportunity to be really big another Enron Europe and we have an excellent opportunity to get it right from the star t and drive this market He is in a unique position to develop a huge busine ss and drive it with technology without having the burden of a large legacy problem I think they look more like an Enron Net Works type of business than most the other business units Enron Japan needs to use the internet to educate and drive this new business to achieve the penetration it needs without an incumbent position The competition and market characteristics fit very well with our statements about ENW in our general presentations Anthony Dayeo has just joined the team Between ENW providing a VP of Anthonys caliber and our other time commitments we are really helping thi s business Initial technology focus will be internet and website driven Coordinati ng with Steve Kean to take a fresh approach to knocking down regulatory barrie rs John Sherriff is managing this business from a commodity point of view an d I think our groups working together will make this a high return future business Human capital is a key constraint issue and we went through priorities an d prioritized for greater effectiveness The group is thinking about using technology the internet and eCommerce every day Enron Korea SK Enron The activities and business plans were much better than I had expected I asked them to go through and discuss their eBusiness plan and it was quite thorough They have completed initial evaluation of EOL applications for the regio n hard copy attached KWeather is already introducing weather derivatives in Korea best shortterm oppt Definite metals opportunity here MG office exists I didnt visit the M G office SKEnron has several assets that can be leveraged into an internet play with very little expense Our technology efforts are paying dividends Inja Chug Sr Director was dedicated here a few months ago Her impact is significant and will great ly assist in IPO eCommerce ENW will be an enormous impact in increasing the value of SKEnron when they IPO next year The internet and eCommercetechnology changes should be able to significantly increase their multiple and provide Enron with a profitable exit option First mover advantage here definitel y has a winnertakeall oppt SKEnron will be the first utility in Korea to offer customers online billing and payment and other related services under development and looki ng for package solution SK currently has million customers that are not being tapped at all Interesting oppt with alliance partners AOL The SKEnron changes and opportunities that are underway are a great example of Enrons ENW ability to change from an old to new economy business A second round eBusiness plan is coming and we can evaluate as a group Excellent executive meeting and dinner with Tony Chey Owner and Chairman of SK SK is a billion company and Tony is the th richest and most powerful person in Korea I went through EnronOnline and our thoughts on t he future of the internet This was very helpful with future events with SK We are definitely setting up a network of eBusiness opportunities within Enron Jeff the commercial opportunities and accountabilities that have begun via the creation of the technology origination activities is really just beginning to gain momentum I am currently driving them via my direct involvement via videoconferences Allan Summor and I are in the process of solidifying a process for driving evaluating and monitoring all of the oth er business units more commercial technology activities When we get this to the next step lets discuss and we can get both of us on the same page as to the best way to coordinate all these efforts Please dont hestitate to call me if you want to discuss anything in more detail

spent Saturday night throwing up I am writing this from my bed and I am improving I should be able to get on the plane tomorrow and am about to eat lunch st meal since Sat but I think it will be fine Im definitely in recovery mode I am having everything messengered out to my house later this afternoon but am concerned about contacts and getting to the hotel I know you have said that it is easy to take the train and the bus but I am concerned about it especially if i am still a little under the weather I still dont want to have a car but would you please set up someone on your staff to meet me at the gate and escort me through the process Sorry if it is a pain but I think I might need it and it will make me feel much more comfortable on the flight over knowing that I will have assistance

comments to your questions below Joe Mike CT AM To Joseph P HirlENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Cathy CT Subject Re Japan trip Joe Thanks for the email I am looking forward to the trip and learning more about what you are doing thus how we can help If we would have had any idea that Europe could have been as big as it has become we would have done some things differently and we can get a head start with Japan This would be most helpful We are clearly trying to avoid the traps that we ran into in Europe and in the US Faster quicker smarter Thursday sounds great and just let me know about Friday Is Anthony in japan during the trip Anthony was here last week and will be back the week after you arrive Remember I am not a technologist and therefore cant discuss technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and opportunities We clearly want your business insight wrt the setup and focus of the business I will send you a presentation that we recently gave to Sherriff It is mostly up to date although continually changing This will help give you a feeling for what the landscape looks like On Wed however I would like to take you through our web presentation and how this fits into our overall strategy A couple of other questions about the trip Do you want me to make any presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans I dont think presentations are necessary unless you would feel more comfortable or have something particularly appropriate The discussion with EPowerEJ on Thursday afternoon would be good if you could speak about Net Works and what Enron is doing across the focus areas On Friday I believe that in the proposed meeting with Softbank a presentation is not necessary For the ACCJ if you had a couple of slides on Enron and our ecomm initiatives this would be great We could put this together here if you would like as I have a couple of your recent presentations Let me know Also what is the appropriate dress code The Japanese still dress up Im afraid suits are de rigour I am assuming suits but i didnt want to make any assumptions about new cultures Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about the dos and donts of both cultures We could try and find something but I think you will find that the Japanese are trying to become more western Despite what you have heard this place is not as foreign as rumored Do I have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport All of us get back and forth on the train and the bus We can get you a driver but you wont get here any faster and is quite expensive US one way I normally get a driver I am uncomfortable in new countries that I cant speak any of the language If there is a way to get lost Ill find a way One more item could you please have your assistant set up a message for me at the hotel I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it really helps Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel after the trip I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the Japanese culture Ono will set something set up here The hotel has its own massage service that can be accessed at almost all hours Thanks Mike Joseph P NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Mike CT cc Subject Re Japan trip Mike We are looking to accomplish a number of things while you are here over Thursday and Friday Thursdays schedule is

last couple of days and I understand that OU has a different recruiting schedule then other schools Enron is on campus for recruiting in the near future a nd I have asked Sally to tag on some interviews for summer interns while on th at trip I believe that she has been able to schedule this so I believe that from an OU perspective it may be a mute point now Doing that should be ab le to maintain the momentum that we have developed at OU and all the work Lexi has done By the way the recruiting trip a couple of weeks ago was very successful If you have any other questions or comments please let me know mike Charlene NRON AM To Sally CT cc Celeste CT Richard NRON Mike CT Subject Re Hiring Practices for Summer Interns Sally Thanks for the email regarding summer interns I apologize that Lexi and Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking I wis h that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin g difficulty I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any member of my staff was not responsive That being said please allow me to explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set it You are absolutely correct It is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge As you are aware over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm Brecker Merryman who has assisted us in a number of different mark et research projects However in my opinion this issue is not one that required much research I have been involved in recruiting in some way shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past years Most major organizations with the exception of the Accounting firm s begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring There are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date particularly in the MBA programs For example Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until January As indicated the firms that generally recrui t in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for spring internships The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns Presentations were made in January February and offers were made in February and March The only school that did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope We did of course recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enrons ability to hire quality s ummer interns This past summer Enron had summer Analysts undergraduate and summer Associates graduate We intentionally limited the number of summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful assignments Approximately of these individuals received permanent offers to join Enron The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire undergraduates for summer positions They generally focus on MBAs particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enrons competitors Because the undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have continued to have a special focus on these individuals ie the reason the re were undergraduates and only MBAs With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about which you raised a concern let me address your concerns In your email y ou indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU You did not howeve r provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU While OU has not gotten back to her following is the information obtained from UT o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson o According to Cindy approximately of companies actively recruiting on campus conduct interviews in the fall for summer internships Cindy attributes this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring or in the case of Andersen Consulting have a tremendous need and conduct all interviews at one time o In conclusion Cindy estimated that of companies actively recruiting on campus recruit in the spring for summer internships We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t he statistics at this time I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such information It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably different than what we were told If you would provide the name of the individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for the discrepancies While I understand your concern with respect to OU they appear to be different than most of the other schools at which we recruit If you belie ve that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are supportive however because Lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently As you are aware in most instances the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early August If you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts I hope this has been helpful I can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager Again I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i f you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance Charlene
