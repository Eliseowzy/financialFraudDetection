Float shares owned by management Background One of the fastest growing segments of the housing market is the housing needs of people over the age of fiftyfive While this is already a large portion of the population over the next few years all baby boomers will hopefully reach age fifty five This age group is the most affluent segment of the population and providing for their special housing needs presents a significant profit opportunity Both retirees and older adults who are still working favor condominium development because they no longer wish to maintain the exterior of their home or their grounds and because of the greater feeling of security offered by a condominium development The type of housing preferred in active adult communities is either attached or semiattached ranch houses Senior homes whether one or two story have their master bedroom on the first floor The active adult communities developed in Connecticut have all sold very quickly These communities range in price from the mid one hundred thousands to townhouses selling for over half a million dollars Recently development of retirement communities has started in Long Island in New York with some being priced in the six and seven hundred thousand dollar range The difficulty faced by developers is that sites for active adult communities are hard to find since there are very few sites zoned for condominium development Furthermore any cluster development is very difficult unless the town water and sewer are available to the site Towns are anxious to have senior developments for the following reasons Senior development generates taxes but do not use town resources such as schools police etc Senior developments allow older residents to stay in the community Consequently towns will usually grant zoning changes for senior housing developments From a developers point of view senior housing is a profitable lower risk product for the following reasons Senior are usually cash buyers and are relatively unaffected by changing interest rates Seniors will pay more per square foot of housing than other homebuyers consequently the profit margins are generally larger Given the difficulty to find good sites most approved sites face little or no competition and sell very quickly Despite the desirability and potential profitability of active adult communities the majority of towns in the Northeast do not have any such communities due to the difficulty of finding appropriate sites Business Plan To develop active adult communities consisting of condominium developments which are restricted to residents fiftyfive years of age and over The initial development projects will occur in the northeast portion of the United States Thus far towns in Connecticut have been chosen for development of to condominium units The estimated sales price for each unit is between and Thru its subsidiary Senior Lifestyle Communities Inc GNCP owns or controls sites East Windsor Hebron Watertown New Milford and Granby The company business plan is to build out the condominium units on the existing sites and buy additional sites in Connecticut and New York Additionally the company plans to acquire and merge with a Regional Construction company so as to control costs of construction and accelerate the time to finish the projects as well as participate in revenues and profitability from other construction Timing The land for each development is initially optioned for due diligence period during which site approval is obtained which includes zoning land use wetlands water and sewer approvals for the subject site After approvals are granted by the municipality then the land purchase is consummated with the seller and the land is purchased from the seller Normal process would then include an Acquisition and Development loan from a local Bank for payment of the seller and payment for development of the site including roads water and sewer to the property Condominium units will mostly be presold to the condominium users and units will be built with construction financing from a local Bank Construction will be done by contracting out building to a local bonded builder It is anticipated that the permitting for development of all sites will be achieved by the spring of and sites could be under construction by summer of Phase One of Business Plan
