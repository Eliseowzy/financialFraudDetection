Limited NEW YORK Oct Reuters US corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday Moodys Investors Service said that in the third quarter it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for US companies At the same time it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just companies That to ratio is far greater than the to ratio in the second quarter In dollar terms the situation looks more dire Moodys warned it may downgrade billion of debt dwarfing the billion Moodys said it may upgrade by to Particularly in light of September the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes said John Puchalla Moodys senior economist A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year Rating reviews are significant because unlike actual rating changes they are not a lagging indicator and suggest the future direction of corporate credit Moodys normally wraps up its reviews within three months US corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons These include the weakening US economy an inability of marginal companies to raise cash debtfinanced merger activity and fallout from the Sept attacks on such industries as airlines insurance and travel For example Moodys in July warned it may cut Comcast Corps ratings after the Philadelphiabased company bid billion for ATT Corps cable TV operations Then last month Moodys warned it may cut Chicagobased Boeing Cos ratings because of the attacks potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes In the third quarter Moodys warned it may cut its ratings of speculativegrade or junkrated companies and raise the ratings of just For investmentgrade companies the gap was even more yawning to And in the fourth quarter Through Friday Moodys warned it may downgrade companies and raise a mere four On Monday it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade Puchalla however said the decline could slow next year in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues he said That is a positive for credit quality The third quarter was the th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades The record is quarters

financial strength but instead its an act of desperation Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved POWER POINTSEnron May Have To Rethink AssetLight Focus By Mark Golden Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones On the face of things its hard to understand the stock markets headspinning reaction to Enron Corps ENE revelation of some bad news in recent weeks Why the talk of a death spiral for North Americas premier energy trading company The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc CSCO for example saw an almost identical drop over a similar month period Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco The difference is that over the past few years Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle not hard assets and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question If youre buying network components you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier After all youre buying something you can touch But if youre buying power or gas what youre really buying is a commitment to deliver If your supplier doesnt come through when the market gets tough youre left totally exposed In Enrons energy trading business then credibility at every level is critical For now Enron looks to be more than viable But the companys assetlight strategy might not be Gross profits from trading have shrunk to in the third quarter from in the first quarter of Meanwhile assetheavy energy companies like Mirant Corp MIR and Calpine Corp CPN successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure Two weeks ago Enron reported a million thirdquarter loss resulting from billion in writeoffs That didnt send investors running however In fact its stock price rose a bit on the news What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets or shareholders equity by billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow That along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities Exchange Commission produced a billion drop in Enrons market value On Monday Moodys Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enrons senior unsecured longterm debt to Baa from Baa leaving it two steps above junkbond levels The agency kept Enrons ratings on watch for further downgrade LongRunning Concerns A hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a reduction in shareholders equity The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enrons loss of credibility Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them but few on the call believed that For some analysts Enrons revelations only fed longrunning concerns about the companys lack of financial disclosure Cary Wasden managing partner of Reed Wasden Research has had a sell recommendation on Enron since March Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms Wasden isnt in the business of selling stock His firm isnt involved in brokerage and isnt a hedge fund Wasden gets paid for his research and the company doesnt invest in the securities it covers A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from onetime sale of physical assets in operating income His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldnt immediately respond Dont believe by any means this is the end of the story Wasden said Wall Street sellside analysts have largely kept Enron as a buy or strong buy as the stock fell from to But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enrons reporting For now the plunge in the price of Enrons shares and bonds which last week started trading like junkrated debt hasnt hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners We havent changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices Were watching it and so is everybody else but they are a solid company Reliant Energy Inc REI spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that Im sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point Keeping Talent A Challenge Enron is a big company far too big to ignore But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders transactions with Enron If the companys investmentgrade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed risk managers wont be able to ignore it whatever else Moodys does Assuming that doesnt happen Enron still faces a tough road ahead Like all companies Enron is the combination of capital and talent For financial companies talent is the more important ingredient and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year The losses can be expected to continue Much of the top management cashed out when the companys stock price was high and moved on Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on if they havent already Over the years Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry Those options are now nearly worthless If Enrons debtservice costs rise the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top When Skilling left nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lays assurances that it was for personal reasons When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week Lay said In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO Thats putting words in Wall Street analysts mouths Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer I dont know anybody who said that Wasden said What did the CFO do what did Skilling do that Ken Lay wasnt part of Real change will have to come from without Wasden said Enron has been a cult more than a company he said Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company it just changes the disciples Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside Nevertheless Wasden thinks Enrons stock has reached its natural floor and if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money it can recover over time There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets like pipelines and power plants he said That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating Given the bind Enron is in Lay wont have much choice Enron will survive but it wont be the same company at all By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved OFFICIAL

liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately

Europes biggest gas and power traders as they hold urgent talks with the US group about setting up new credit arrangements the sources said I think Enrons approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow said the head of risk management at one UK utility that halted its trade with Enron last week They are talking with us about bank letters of credit he said The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis A spokesman for Enrons European headquarters in London headquarters declined

Enron Puts Spotlight Back On Broadband By Michael Rieke Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column HOUSTON Dow Jones Thanks to Enron Corp ENE the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money But it wont be traders who will cash in on this new potential It will be classaction attorneys Theyre already lining up to sue Enron in at least five shareholder suits As of Oct two of lawsuits had been filed against Enron in federal court and three more in Texas state court Most of them name as defendants Ken Lay Enrons longtime chairman former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow Enrons chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence Oct Still another suit which isnt a class action suit was filed naming as defendants members of Enrons board of directors All the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships Enron set up many of them managed by Fastow Most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the Fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with Enron The transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband water and other Enron investments Fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions As Enrons chief financial officer he was being paid to manage the corporations finances As general partner of two LJM partnerships he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with Enron He shared in profits of those partnerships When investors began demanding information about the transactions Enrons share price began to slide With the heat on Enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked million related to losses from early termination of the deals among other things Thats when the class action attorneys went to work So far at least law firms are representing the plaintiffs Enron didnt respond to calls asking about the lawsuits Among the law firms representing plaintiffs is Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes Lerach which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit The release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than billion from class action lawsuits The lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market Some of the deals with the LJM partnerships run by Fastow purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market according to Abrams and Franks v Enron et al That could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months Market skeptics have said Enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth Enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties a total of in the second quarter of this year according to Enron Now market watchers will want to know if any of Enrons trades were done with the LJM partnerships managed by Fastow They will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with Chewco Investments That Houston company according to a report in The Wall Street Journal was managed by Michael Kopper and was set up in when Kopper was a managing director with Enrons Global Equity Markets Group He left Enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by Fastow Do the plaintiffs attorneys know whether Enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships I think if is too early to tell Thomas Bilek of Hoeffner Bilek told Bandwidth Beat As you know information is coming out in drabs and dribbles from Enron It could be several months before plaintiffs attorneys get a chance to ask Enron officials those questions Bilek said Its also too early to tell what potential damages plaintiffs could win said Steven Schulman an attorney with Milberg Weiss At this point you can only talk about it in terms of shareholder losses and the losses are in the billions Total losses will depend on the price each shareholder plaintiff paid for the stock and the price at which each shareholder later sold the stock Enrons share price topped out between and in the summer of last year It set a week low Oct at That spread leaves plenty of room for losses Schulman told Bandwidth Beat that the record for losses in shareholder cases is billion in a case involving Cendant Corp CD Damages are usually a substantial portion of losses Schulman said Whether the Enron case is bigger or less I couldnt opine he said This is a big case by any means By Michael Rieke Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved
