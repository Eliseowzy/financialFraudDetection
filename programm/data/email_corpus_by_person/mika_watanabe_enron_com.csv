Yomiuri Copyright C The Yomiuri Shimbun Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire Enron Japan Corp a Japanese subsidiary of United States energy giant Enron Corp published a reform proposal for the Japanese electricity market Tuesday The proposal urged the government to implement the suggested reforms over a twoyear period beginning at the start of following deregulation of the Japanese retail electric power market which began in March this year Japan has allowed nonutility companies to supply power to industrial and commercial users since March Enron is seeking to enter the Japanese energy market on a largescale basis following the deregulation efforts In the reform proposal Enron Japan argued that the present liberalization of the electricity market was insufficient by presenting original data showing that Japanese electricity charges were percent higher than average when compared with those of other member countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development Enrons reform proposal includes measures to promote competitiveness in the Japanese market such as a separation of conventional power companies supply operations from the generation transmission and distribution of electricity The proposal also contends that conventional power companies are monopolies that should be prohibited from constructing new electricitygenerating facilities within the areas they currently supply It also urges the privatizing of operations for the development of power sources These measure are meant to make it easier for those newly entering the business to gain a competitive foothold In March Enron applied for approval from Aomori Prefecture to build a large thermal power plant in Rokkashomura Copyright The Daily Yomiuri Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity MarketNikkei Dow Jones International News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc TOKYO NikkeiAsserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese companies save as much as Y trillion major US energy firm Enron Corp ENE on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market by separating operations such as power generation transmission and distribution The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Enrons point proposal also calls for the construction of more power plants and fullscale deregulation of retail electricity including sales to households If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to match the levels of other industrialized nations Japans industrial sector could trim its costs by Y trillion Enron said At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron the company asserted that Japans deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity auctions in and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant benefits to endusers New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined of the entire electricity sector Enron said criticizing the fact that power plant facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies Regarding prices an official representing operators of power generation facilities asserted that industrialuse electricity prices in Japan are stuck at a high level at around Y per kilowatt compared with Y in the US Y in Canada Y in Germany and YY in Southeast Asia In fact department store operator Takashimaya Co or JTKA which last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity supply was able to cut costs by Y million in the first year said a company official Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to spin off different operations analysts say If the number of power generation facility operators increases this will help bolster Japans electricity trading market an area in which Enron has a strong business interest Splitting electricity operations into generation transmission and distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new entrants This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power generation facilities Enron says Citing the power shortage in California however Japans electricity sector has strongly opposed such spinoffs stating that generation and distribution must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply Japan could cut tril yen a year in energy costs Enron Kyodo News Copyright Kyodo News International Inc Japanese industries could save trillion yen a year in energy costs if electricity charges were lowered to European and US levels a senior executive of US energy firm Enron Corp said Tuesday At a business gathering in Tokyo Steven Kean an executive vice president of Enron said electricity charges are still rising in Japan despite progress in cost reductions in Europe and the US Japan needs to remove regulations on power transmission lines and let users choose suppliers freely he said Establishing an independent supervising body for the industry and mapping out transparent rules for information disclosure are also necessary he said Enron is seeking to enter the Japanese energy market on a fullfledged basis following Japans deregulation in March of its retail electric power market In March it applied for approval from Aomori Prefecture northern Japan for a plan to build a large thermal power plant in the village of Rokkasho JAPAN Enron says high power rates costing Japan Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited TOKYO May Reuters A senior executive of US energy giant Enron Corp said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen billion in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD averagesavings to allcustomers would be about four trillion yen per year Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation Kean said that indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy resources were often blamed for Japans high electricity rates But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japans high electricity rates A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in Japans electricity rates for industrial users were yen per kilowatt hour kWh compared to a second highest rate of yen in Italy Japans business sector has expressed concern at the nations high electricity rates saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the international market Kean also drew parallels between Japan in the midst of deregulation and California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating its market in These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue permits to allow the construction of new power plants he said The regulatory structure in Japan is very strictjust like in California Kean said North Americas biggest buyer and seller of electricity Enron gained its first foothold in Japan in when it established affiliate E Power Corp In April of last year it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market a process he said held many benefits Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market Since March last year largelot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers The measure liberalised an estimated percent of the power market and ended Japans power utilities regional monopoly However industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall The Japanese government is due to review the process in Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower RatesIndus Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc TOKYO Dow Jones Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market in order to bring down the countrys high power rates while ensuring stable power supply experts said at an industry seminar Tuesday The pressure is mounting for Japans power utilities which have long enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago to become cost effective and performanceconscious after the government partially liberalized the retail power market in March However the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to conventional power companies What happened in overseas power industries suggest that the liberalization in Japan wouldnt only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable power supply significantly said Tatsuo Hatta professor of economics at the University of Tokyo Compared with the US Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as much for households and three times higher for industrial users There is a large discrepancy in rates and that is why we should hurriedly implement the liberalization Hatta said He said Japans steep seasonal peakload curve one of the reasons the power companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan can be altered once the prices are liberalized If power rates are set higher during those peak hours following the liberalization users would refrain from using electricity Steven Kean executive vice president of the US energy major Enron Corp ENE told the same seminar that Japans power costs remain on the upward trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the US He said Japan could achieve a costsaving of Y trillion a year if its power prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries following the liberalization Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called Reassessing Power Deregulation which was cosponsored by the Houstonbased Enron Hatta of the University of Tokyo said its very wise that Japan has begun the deregulation with the bilateral supply or trade system under which suppliers and users clinch deals directly Under the current reforms the sector for highvolume largelot industrial and commercial users which represents only of the Y trillion market is opened to free competition The government is to review the partial deregulation by for further deregulation Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power providers Hatta said Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation should destroy the systems that have supported the countrys high power rates regional monopolies and the fair rate return method under which all costs are levied on prices There is absolutely no need to set the same power prices nationwide Hatta said Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand he said Yoshinori Omuro vice president of Takashimaya Cos JTKA or management department acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation Takashimaya a major department store operator has shifted to Diamond Power Corp a whollyowned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp JMIB or as its power supplier at two of its stores with strong backup from the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry Despite the deregulation the situation isnt where we can negotiate with power utilities to reduce electricity costs We have no choice but select independent power providers Omuro said By Maki Aoto Dow Jones Newswires

Yomiuri Copyright C The Yomiuri Shimbun Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire Enron Japan Corp a Japanese subsidiary of United States energy giant Enron Corp published a reform proposal for

retail electric power market which began in March this year Japan has allowed nonutility companies to supply power to industrial and commercial users since March Enron is seeking to enter the Japanese

presenting original data showing that Japanese electricity charges were percent higher than average when compared with those of other member countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development Enrons reform proposal includes measures to promote competitiveness in the Japanese market such as a separation of conventional power companies supply operations from the generation transmission and distribution of electricity The proposal also contends that conventional power companies are monopolies that should be prohibited from constructing new electricitygenerating facilities within the areas they currently supply It also urges the privatizing of operations for the development of power sources These measure are meant to make it easier for those newly entering

he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japans high electricity rates A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in Japans electricity rates for industrial users were yen per

fully liberalize the retail market in order to bring down the countrys high power rates while ensuring stable power supply experts said at an industry seminar Tuesday The pressure is mounting for Japans power utilities which have long enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago to become cost effective and performanceconscious after the government partially liberalized the retail power market in March However the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to conventional power companies What happened in overseas power industries suggest that the liberalization in Japan wouldnt only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable power supply significantly said Tatsuo Hatta professor of economics at the University of Tokyo Compared with the US Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as much for households and three times higher for industrial users There is a large discrepancy in rates and that is why we should hurriedly implement the liberalization Hatta said He said Japans steep seasonal peakload curve one of the reasons the power companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan can be altered once the prices are liberalized If power rates are set higher during those peak hours following the liberalization users would refrain from using electricity Steven Kean executive vice president of the US energy major Enron Corp ENE told the same seminar that Japans power costs remain on the upward trend despite cost reductions in Europe and

begun the deregulation with the bilateral supply or trade system under which suppliers and users clinch deals directly Under the current reforms the sector for highvolume largelot industrial and commercial users which represents only of the Y trillion market is opened to free competition The government is to review the partial deregulation by for further deregulation Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power providers Hatta said Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation should destroy the systems that have supported the countrys high power rates regional monopolies and the fair rate return method under which all costs are levied on prices There is absolutely no need to set the same power prices nationwide Hatta said Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand he said

Yomiuri Copyright C The Yomiuri Shimbun Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire Enron Japan Corp a Japanese subsidiary of United States energy giant Enron Corp published a reform proposal for the Japanese electricity market Tuesday The proposal urged the government to implement the suggested reforms over a twoyear period beginning at the start of following deregulation of the Japanese retail electric power market which began in March this year Japan has allowed nonutility companies to supply power to industrial and commercial users since March Enron is seeking to enter the Japanese energy market on a largescale basis following the deregulation efforts In the reform proposal Enron Japan argued that the present liberalization of the electricity market was insufficient by presenting original data showing that Japanese electricity charges were percent higher than average when compared with those of other member countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development Enrons reform proposal includes measures to promote competitiveness in the Japanese market such as a separation of conventional power companies supply operations from the generation transmission and distribution of electricity The proposal also contends that conventional power companies are monopolies that should be prohibited from constructing new electricitygenerating facilities within the areas they currently supply It also urges the privatizing of operations for the development of power sources These measure are meant to make it easier for those newly entering the business to gain a competitive foothold In March Enron applied for approval from Aomori Prefecture to build a large thermal power plant in Rokkashomura Copyright The Daily Yomiuri Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity MarketNikkei Dow Jones International News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc TOKYO NikkeiAsserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese companies save as much as Y trillion major US energy firm Enron Corp ENE on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market by separating operations such as power generation transmission and distribution The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Enrons point proposal also calls for the construction of more power plants and fullscale deregulation of retail electricity including sales to households If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to match the levels of other industrialized nations Japans industrial sector could trim its costs by Y trillion Enron said At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron the company asserted that Japans deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity auctions in and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant benefits to endusers New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined of the entire electricity sector Enron said criticizing the fact that power plant facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies Regarding prices an official representing operators of power generation facilities asserted that industrialuse electricity prices in Japan are stuck at a high level at around Y per kilowatt compared with Y in the US Y in Canada Y in Germany and YY in Southeast Asia In fact department store operator Takashimaya Co or JTKA which last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity supply was able to cut costs by Y million in the first year said a company official Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to spin off different operations analysts say If the number of power generation facility operators increases this will help bolster Japans electricity trading market an area in which Enron has a strong business interest Splitting electricity operations into generation transmission and distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new entrants This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power generation facilities Enron says Citing the power shortage in California however Japans electricity sector has strongly opposed such spinoffs stating that generation and distribution must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply Japan could cut tril yen a year in energy costs Enron Kyodo News Copyright Kyodo News International Inc Japanese industries could save trillion yen a year in energy costs if electricity charges were lowered to European and US levels a senior executive of US energy firm Enron Corp said Tuesday At a business gathering in Tokyo Steven Kean an executive vice president of Enron said electricity charges are still rising in Japan despite progress in cost reductions in Europe and the US Japan needs to remove regulations on power transmission lines and let users choose suppliers freely he said Establishing an independent supervising body for the industry and mapping out transparent rules for information disclosure are also necessary he said Enron is seeking to enter the Japanese energy market on a fullfledged basis following Japans deregulation in March of its retail electric power market In March it applied for approval from Aomori Prefecture northern Japan for a plan to build a large thermal power plant in the village of Rokkasho JAPAN Enron says high power rates costing Japan Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited TOKYO May Reuters A senior executive of US energy giant Enron Corp said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen billion in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD averagesavings to allcustomers would be about four trillion yen per year Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation Kean said that indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy resources were often blamed for Japans high electricity rates But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japans high electricity rates A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in Japans electricity rates for industrial users were yen per kilowatt hour kWh compared to a second highest rate of yen in Italy Japans business sector has expressed concern at the nations high electricity rates saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the international market Kean also drew parallels between Japan in the midst of deregulation and California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating its market in These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue permits to allow the construction of new power plants he said The regulatory structure in Japan is very strictjust like in California Kean said North Americas biggest buyer and seller of electricity Enron gained its first foothold in Japan in when it established affiliate E Power Corp In April of last year it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market a process he said held many benefits Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market Since March last year largelot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers The measure liberalised an estimated percent of the power market and ended Japans power utilities regional monopoly However industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall The Japanese government is due to review the process in Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower RatesIndus Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc TOKYO Dow Jones Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market in order to bring down the countrys high power rates while ensuring stable power supply experts said at an industry seminar Tuesday The pressure is mounting for Japans power utilities which have long enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago to become cost effective and performanceconscious after the government partially liberalized the retail power market in March However the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to conventional power companies What happened in overseas power industries suggest that the liberalization in Japan wouldnt only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable power supply significantly said Tatsuo Hatta professor of economics at the University of Tokyo Compared with the US Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as much for households and three times higher for industrial users There is a large discrepancy in rates and that is why we should hurriedly implement the liberalization Hatta said He said Japans steep seasonal peakload curve one of the reasons the power companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan can be altered once the prices are liberalized If power rates are set higher during those peak hours following the liberalization users would refrain from using electricity Steven Kean executive vice president of the US energy major Enron Corp ENE told the same seminar that Japans power costs remain on the upward trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the US He said Japan could achieve a costsaving of Y trillion a year if its power prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries following the liberalization Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called Reassessing Power Deregulation which was cosponsored by the Houstonbased Enron Hatta of the University of Tokyo said its very wise that Japan has begun the deregulation with the bilateral supply or trade system under which suppliers and users clinch deals directly Under the current reforms the sector for highvolume largelot industrial and commercial users which represents only of the Y trillion market is opened to free competition The government is to review the partial deregulation by for further deregulation Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power providers Hatta said Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation should destroy the systems that have supported the countrys high power rates regional monopolies and the fair rate return method under which all costs are levied on prices There is absolutely no need to set the same power prices nationwide Hatta said Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand he said Yoshinori Omuro vice president of Takashimaya Cos JTKA or management department acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation Takashimaya a major department store operator has shifted to Diamond Power Corp a whollyowned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp JMIB or as its power supplier at two of its stores with strong backup from the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry Despite the deregulation
