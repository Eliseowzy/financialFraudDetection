Foreign Exchange Transaction RegulationsFETR a prior report to the Bank of Korea is required for the Derivative Transaction whose underlying assets are not financial products ie Commodity Derivative by our own definition is a legal issue to be clarified and handled carefully However speaking with the Bank of Korea and Hyundai Oil I have the understanding that the Bank of Korea is willing to be flexible enough to accommodate instantaneous online derivative trading We might need official confirmation of this from the Bank of Korea but I think that working with the Bank of Korea we could find a solution to this legal issue The following are some of the facts regarding the reporting requirement issue Although the Bank of Korea has the legal discretion to reject any report made when I spoke with them a month ago they emphasized their intention that they would not reject any report unless the transaction falls under either of the two categories stipulated in the Article of the FETR option premium more than illegal transaction Early this week I talked with the Bank of Korea and Hyundai Oil and both of them confirmed that since Apr last year total reports from Hyundai Oil have been filed with the Bank of Korea regarding Oil derivative transactions All reports were submitted after the transactions had been made ex post facto reporting and many times Hyundai Oil put transactions together in one package onepage filled out form per transaction for reporting Thats why Kim Chang the local law firm got the information of reports from the Bank of Korea Both Hyundai Oil and the Bank of Korea said that the report is more like a notification and that the Bank of Korea just checks whether the transaction falls under either of the said categories As far as a transaction does not fall under either of the categories neither the Bank of Korea nor Hyundai Oil cares about the reporting The Bank of Korea does not insist on reviewing the report prior to the transaction and does not care even if the report is made even or weeks later Thats why sometimes it takes a week for the Bank of Korea to return the report with its seal on it The Bank of Korea said that normally it takes less than one hour to review and place its seal on a onepage report Regarding the Weather Derivatives there is an issue whether Weather Derivatives will be classified as a Commodity Derivative or a Financial Derivative since Korea has no experience with such a product In the FETR there is a general definition of the Derivative Transaction No separate definition of the Commodity Derivatives or Financial Derivatives However the FETR treats the Derivative Transaction whose underlying products are commodity products like grains and metals differently from the Derivative Transaction whose underlying products are financial products like interest payments and foreign currencies For convenience sake I would call the former the Commodity Derivative and the latter the Financial Derivative The FETR stipulates that a prior report to the Bank of Korea is required for the Derivative Transaction whose underlying assets are not financial products ie Commodity Derivative by our own definition and that a prior approval of the Bank of Korea is required for the Derivative Transaction whose underlying assets are financial products Financial Derivative by our definition among nonbanking residents or between nonbanking resident and nonresident No approval or report is required for the Financial Derivative Transaction if a banking institution is involved When I talked to the Intl Finance Dept of the Bank of Korea which is responsible for the prior report and approval they informally indicated that the underlying asset of the Weather Derivatives doesnt seem to be a financial product They said that they would need better understanding of the Weather Derivatives in order to determine that formally I hope that Matts note and the above information are useful for all of you to understand the legal situation better Lets discuss and clarify these issues in our conference call Thanks Regards JaeMoo Matthias CT PM To JaeMoo NRON cc Christopher B HuntENRON NRON NRON Joseph P

EOL Korea JaeMoo On the section of RegulatoryLegal Environment it may be useful to note There is no official rule or regulation that ex post facto reporting for Commodity Derivatives are acceptable to the Bank of Korea although your and Korean external lawyers Kim Chang informal verbal enquiries with the Bank of Korea have suggested they have accepted some or reports since April last year all from Hyundai Oil The Bank of Korea take up to two weeks to review the reports and as Kim Chang has advised there remains a possibility that the Bank of Korea may reject the report although they were not able to advise the grounds on which a report may be rejected Although a foreign counterparty need not file a report or seek approval the Korean counterparty must still do so for the benefit and interest of the foreign counterparty Kim Chang advised that where reporting or approval is required but is not made or obtained the Korean counterparty would not be able to remit its payments under the transaction This would clearly impact on the settlement of the transaction in particular shorter term deals since reporting and approval may take several weeks The Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that a foreign exchange authorization that was originally required should be obtained in order for a foreign party to execute any judgment against the Korean party and remit the proceeds Regards Matt

for Japan Oz thus qtr as discussed we are ready to rollout Korean W say in Mid October Your email presenatation thus arrived at a very good time Just some questions You may answer in the conference call or by email your choice a why has W derivatives been singled out by FSC for potential review when there is no regulation of eg LPG or plastics swaps fwds pg of presentation We are just talking about the theoretical possibility of FSCs Financial Supervisory Commission review of Weather Derivatives because of the novelt y in Korea although according to the Kim Chang report there are currently no laws or regulations in Korea that regulate marketing of OTC derivative transactions through the internet or otherwise When we talked to FSC a couple of months ago they confirmed that there is no law or regulation restricting Weather Derivatives in Korea FSC did not indicate any intenti on to review Weather Derivatives for regulation either In addition according to the Kim Chang report Weather Derivatives would not be considered to be an insurance contract subject to Korean insurance regulations Kim Chang also believes that Weather Derivatives should not be considered gambling or wagering but a legitimate method of hedging risks relating to weather b How necessary are the meetings with pg of presentation Bank of Korea BOK Ministry of Finance Economy MOFE for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives Is this meeting to meet except for Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations FETR in case of foreign currency trades Classification of weather derivatives as commodity or financial derivativ es under FETR needs to be resolvedpg of presentation Can we just do it first with Enron Korea as the counterparty If so if Korean coy transacts with Enron Korea there should be no problem in remitting funds wholly within Korea Also we intend to offer product in Won only so no FX involved at all According to the Kim Chang report FETR is the only regulation that regulates OTC derivative transactions and FETR is applicable only when FX is involved in a transaction or when a transaction is between a Korean residen t and a nonresident Thus as far as we understand based on the Kim Chang report and conversations with FSC and other local lawyers if a transaction Weather derivative or other commodity derivative is between residents in Korea eg a Korean customer and Enron Korea in Korean currency Won neither FETR nor any other regulations are applicable No report or approv al would be required c pg of presentation All other EnronOnline products with the exception of bandwidth and emission allowances are classified as commodity derivatives in Korea Why is it bandwidth and emission are classified differently Will not Weather fall under same category There is no classification or definition of bandwidth emission or weather derivative products in Korea since Korea has no experience in such products or concepts Please refer to my previous email to Matt for definitions of derivative transactions commodity and financial Commodity derivatives require a prior reporting to the Bank of Korea fo r each trade Is this only relevant if product is not in Won but foreign currency The reporting requirement is relevant under the FETR only which is applied for a transaction with FX involved or between a resident and nonresident i n Korea pg of presentation Note that Dr Christian Werner Sydney office will be the person for Data system For weather derivative products arrange with a weather forecasting company for the weather data feed timing depends on the location We will provide relevant information for Christian We will be able to assist with if reqd see points b c above Thanks It would be necessary only when we decide to deal with

investigating whether or not it would make sense to seriously consider an EOL launch in Korea from a market regulatory and legal perspective The primary interest has been on reviewing whether or not we could launch existing products in Korea eg products already handled by Singapore EOL as well as new products eg Seoul weather This initial work was directed primarily by the Korea team working within the APACHI group If a launch is to progress much further from this point however substantial attention by the EOL team would be required To facilitate this the attached presentation summarizes our primary findings to date and some of our thoughts We would appreciate your taking a look at the attached document We would like to arrange a conference call for next Thursday Aug st at pm by Houston time Friday at am by Tokyo time to discuss the attached document and to solicit thoughts as to next steps Please let me know whether you will be able to join this call or if you have a conflict an alternative time Your participation will be greatly appreciated Best regards JaeMoo

Korean Weather in the near future It would be tough to sell Weather Derivatives in Korea but the early move can be positive for us especially because KWeather a local weather forecasting company is

To Jae Moo Impressive Ppoint presentation indeed Friday Sep am TYO time is good for Australia I will be attending is there anything that i need to arrange at our end After the successful rollout of W for Japan Oz thus qtr as discussed we are ready to rollout Korean W say in Mid October Your email presenatation thus arrived at a very good time Just some questions You may answer in the conference call or by email your choice a why has W derivatives been singled out by FSC for potential review when there is no regulation of eg LPG or plastics swaps fwds pg of presentation We are just talking about the theoretical possibility of FSCs Financial Supervisory Commission review of Weather Derivatives because of the novelt y in Korea although according to the Kim Chang report there are currently no laws or regulations in Korea that regulate marketing of OTC derivative transactions through the internet or otherwise When we talked to FSC a couple of months ago they confirmed that there is no law or regulation restricting Weather Derivatives in Korea FSC did not indicate any intenti on to review Weather Derivatives for regulation either In addition according to the Kim Chang report Weather Derivatives would not be considered to be an insurance contract subject to Korean insurance regulations Kim Chang also believes that Weather Derivatives should not be considered gambling or wagering but a legitimate method of hedging risks relating to weather b How necessary are the meetings with pg of presentation Bank of Korea BOK Ministry of Finance Economy MOFE for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives Is this meeting to meet except for Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations FETR in case of foreign currency trades Classification of weather derivatives as commodity or financial derivativ es under FETR needs to be resolvedpg of presentation Can we just do it first with Enron Korea as the counterparty If so if Korean coy transacts with Enron Korea there should be no problem in remitting funds wholly within Korea Also we intend to offer product in Won only so no FX involved at all According to the Kim Chang report FETR is the only regulation that regulates OTC derivative transactions and FETR is applicable only when FX is involved in a transaction or when a transaction is between a Korean residen t and a nonresident Thus as far as we understand based on the Kim Chang report and conversations with FSC and other local lawyers if a transaction Weather derivative or other commodity derivative is between residents in Korea eg a Korean customer and Enron Korea in Korean currency Won neither FETR nor any other regulations are applicable No report or approv al would be required c pg of presentation All other EnronOnline products with the exception of bandwidth and emission allowances are classified as commodity derivatives in Korea Why is it bandwidth and emission are classified differently Will not Weather fall under same category There is no classification or definition of bandwidth emission or weather derivative products in Korea since Korea has no experience in such products or concepts Please refer to my previous email to Matt for definitions of derivative transactions commodity and financial Commodity derivatives require a prior reporting to the Bank of Korea fo r each trade Is this only relevant if product is not in Won but foreign currency The reporting requirement is relevant under the FETR only which is applied for a transaction with FX involved or between a resident and nonresident i n Korea pg of presentation Note that Dr Christian Werner Sydney office will be the person for Data system For weather derivative products arrange with a weather forecasting company for the weather data feed timing depends on the location We will provide relevant information for Christian We will be able to assist with if reqd see points b c above Thanks It would be necessary only when we decide to deal with FETR For weather derivatives arrange presentation meetings with BOKMO FE for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives May require longer time for their decision making Korea

Environment it may be useful to note There is no official rule or regulation that ex post facto reporting for Commodity Derivatives are acceptable to the Bank of Korea although your an d Korean external lawyers Kim Chang informal verbal enquiries with the Bank of Korea have suggested they have accepted some or reports since April last year all from Hyundai Oil The Bank of Korea take up to two weeks to review the reports and as Kim Chang has advised there remains a possibility that the Bank of Korea may reject the report although they were not able to advise the grounds on whi ch a report may be rejected Although a foreign counterparty need not file a report or seek approval the Korean counterparty must still do so for the benefit and interest of th e foreign counterparty Kim Chang advised that where reporting or approval is required but is not made or obtained the Korean counterparty would not be able to remit its payments under the transaction This would clearly impact on the settlement of the transaction in particular shorter term deals sinc e reporting and approval may take several weeks The Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that a foreign exchange authorizati on that was originally required should be obtained in order for a foreign part y to execute any judgment against the Korean party and remit the proceeds Regards Matt JaeMoo NRON PM To Christopher B
