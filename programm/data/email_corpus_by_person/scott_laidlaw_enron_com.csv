<2334870.1075845627713.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,scott.laidlaw@enron.com,2000-11-29 02:53:00,Warm Fuzzies from BWare neat regards scott FIVE GREAT LESSONS Most Important Lesson During my second month of nursing school our professor gave us a pop quiz I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questionsuntil I read the last one What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school Surely this was some kind of joke I had seen the cleaning woman several times She was tall darkhaired and in her s but how would I know her name I handed in my paper leaving the last question blank Just before class ended one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade Absolutely said the professor In your careers you will meet many people All are significant They deserve your attention and care even if all you do is smile and say hello Ive never forgotten that lesson I also learned her name was Dorothy Second Important Lesson Pickup in the Rain One night at PM an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride Soaking wet she decided to flag down the next car A young white man stopped to help her generally unheard of in those conflictfilled s The man took her to safety helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi cab She seemed to be in a big hurry but wrote down his address and thanked him Seven days went by and a knock came on the mans door To his surprise a giant console color TV was delivered to his home A special note was attached It read Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night The rain drenched not only my clothes but also my spirits Then you came along Because of you I was able to make it to my dying husbands bedside just before he passed away God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others Sincerely Mrs Nat King Cole Third Important Lesson Always remember those who serve In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less a year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table A waitress put a glass of water in front of him How much is an ice cream sundae he asked Fifty cents replied the waitress The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it Well how much is a plain dish of ice cream he inquired By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient Thirtyfive cents she brusquely replied The little boy again counted his coins Ill have the plain ice cream he said The waitress brought the ice cream put the bill on the table and walked away The boy finished the ice cream paid the cashier and left When the waitress came back she began to cry as she wiped down the table There placed neatly beside the empty dish were two nickels and five pennies You see he couldnt have the sundae because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip Fourth Important Lesson The Obstacle in Our Path In ancient times a King had a boulder placed on a roadway then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock Some of the kings wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables Upon approaching the boulder the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road After much pushing and straining he finally succeeded After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway The peasant learned what many of us never understand Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition Fifth Important Lesson Giving When it Counts Many years ago when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her year old brother who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness The doctor explained the situation to her little brother and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying Yes Ill do it if it will save her As the transfusion progressed he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled as we all did seeing the color returning to her cheeks Then his face grew pale and his smile faded He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice Will I start to die right away Being young the little boy had misunderstood the doctor he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her You see after all understanding and attitude are everything

answer remains yes again must discuss with enas ben jacoby because of his commercial involvementexpectations If so I must provide proof of ownership of the damaged generator other than an email message Please provide ASAP comment what do you need while enron has made approx of the payments for the gas turbine generator unit it is likely that ownership still resides with westinghouse ie it was never delivered per the equipment purchase contract with enron again what type of documentation do you need does it matter if westinghouse is still in the loop further comment at this time title ownership care custody and control remain with westinghouse further westinghouse must continue to be in the loop because the monies for the damaged might ultimately be paid to them ie westinghouse provides enron with a new replacement generator then westinghouse receives the insurance money to cover their lossdamaged generator Is the generator to be repaired comment no the generator is not to

Underwriters surveyor needs to examine it when it is taken apart comment na The surveyor was told when he made an inspection at the Port that a detailed repair estimate would be provided to him on the other unit that was damaged and this would provide a guide as to the type of damage on our unit comment only the generator was damaged the gas turbine is complete and resides in houston i do not understand your comment about damage to another unit further comment the other unit does not belong to enron ie it belongs to another westinghouse client plz understand that the other unit was immersed deeper in salt water than our unit as a result its damage was greater in that we are getting a replacement generator we have to assume that the other unit that was also damaged is also being replaced therefore it can be inferred that the damage estimate for both generators are approximately the same To date nothing has been sent to our surveyor comment none further comment we are not sure about your statement our understanding is that you previously both communicated with and sent the accident survey of westinghouses underwriter to our surveyor As it has been over three months since the unit arrived in Houston in its damaged condition if Enron expects to collect from Enron cargo insurers we must move forward in providing the information previously requested or prejudice Enrons

MVIndustrialBridge Jim Sharron seems content with what you have provided regarding Enrons responsibility to insure etc Thank you She is now asking the following What is Enron claiming for response siemens westinghouse iswill be claiming for full and total loss of the generator a replacement generator is currently being manufactured in austria and will arrive in port of houston tx in the mid april timeframe we have a meeting sched with them next week well attempt to determine what the value of just the generator is from siemenswestinghouse ie we have a price for the gas turbine generator unit but not separate prices for just the gas turbine and the generator What is the financial extent of Enrons claim response plz refer to above comment It seems to me that the short answers to these questions would be The cost to repair the generator that Enron was supposed to receive from SWPC response again we are talking about a total loss and not just a repair plz see above Unknown until SWPC actually tears down the generator and determines the extent of damage and the cost to repair response again the generator will not be repaired therefore this question is na Those answers however will certainly provoke further questions such as When and where is SWPC going to tear down the unit inspect it and determine the repair costs response plz see prior email also the generator will not be repaired therefore this question is na Isnt the water damage just getting worse as the generator just sits there unopened with no measures taken to prevent further deterioration response plz understand that siemens westinghouse still has care custody and control of the damaged generator at this time siemens westinghouse considers the generator a total loss normally this would have been a great question however given the circumstances this question is na Jim if anyone can provide a response to Sharrons questions please let me know what you find out Thanks Thanks Ted Rosen PM Will this

from westinghouse in it they assert that title to the existing generator passed to enron upon delivery into the united states delivery occurred at houston on or about jul as required by the contract and incoterms risk of loss to the generator passed to enron when the generator arrived ddp at houston while the generator remained on board the common carrier the generator was delivered in an undamaged condition title and risk of loss passed to enron before the water damage to the generator occurred xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx b per the contract between enron and westinghouse section title to Equipment Title to the Equipment will pass to Purchaser immediately upon entry into the united states section risk of loss Seller shall bear the risk of loss and damage with respect to the Equipment until delivery of the Equipment to the Delivery Point in accordance with Section Seller shall be required to inspect the Equipment for damage at the Delivery Point section Seller shall cause the Equipment to be delivered to the Delivery Point on a DDP basis in accordance with Sections by the date set forth therein section Seller shall be responsible for delivering the CTUnit DDP to the iii us port of export by any means of transport section Seller shall perform customs clearance for the Equipment through us customs and pay any import duties section Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date Seller will cause the CTUnit authors note includes the generator to be delivered in an undamaged condition in accordance with the SpecificationCT to the Delivery Point DDP in accordance with Schedule I below the Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date authors note the date specified in the contract was later slipped per agreement with enron section Completion of Delivery delivery of the CTUnit to the Delivery Point shall be considered complete for the purposes of Delivery Liquidated Damages as it pertains to the delivery of Major Components authors note includes the GT and generator when the last Major Component of such CTUnit is delivered DDP to the Delivery Point in complete and undamaged condition Purchaser shall have the right to inspect the Equipment for condition of the Equipment upon actual delivery Purchaser reserves the right to reject damaged Equipment at any location however in the event a portion of the Equipment is damaged or defective upon delivery to the Delivery Point Purchaser after making an initial assessment of the damage or defect and consulting with Seller as to how such damage will affect the installation operation performance reliability efficiency and warranty of the damaged Equipment may either i reasonable determine that such damage or defect is such that the preceding criteria is so adversely affected that Purchaser cannot accept delivery of the damaged Equipment and declare that delivery has not occurred or ii after taking into account such criteria and Sellers proposed plan for correcting such damage or defect in accordance with Section declare that delivery has occurred in the event Purchaser discovers such a damage or defect it shall notify Seller of such as soon as practical c facts of the case as we know them common carrier ship carrying the generator supposedly arrived in port of houston approx jul ie that was the ships estimated time of arrival eta westinghouse is claiming that delivery occurred on or about jul enron representative frank cervenka went to CTSS ie the westinghouse facility here in houston on friday jul to inspect the combustion turbine during that inspection westinghouse employees informed him that the generator had salt water damage at the port as a result the following monday jul he visited the port of houston with the siemenswestinghouse insurance adjustor and saw the damaged generator note this was just a cursory visit to verify that in fact the unit had been damaged the full extent of the damage and impact on the project was not known at that time eg repair or replace were still viable options enron received formal notification faxed letter of the damaged generator on approx aug enron has already made progress payments to siemenswestinghouse in the amount of of the contract value of the gas turbine and generator DDP per incoterms means delivered duty paid Westinghouse despite prior requests from enron has not provided copies of the customs clearance documentation ie we dont know the exact date that the generator cleared customs or if it cleared customs title means ownership but does not imply either risk of loss or care custody and control with title comes both ownership and the responsibility for payment of taxes d info not known by enron when did ship come into port when did damage to generator occur when or if us customs duties were paid f info known by enron generator is a total loss as determined by westinghouse per section of contract enron was not given the formal opportunity to inspect the damaged generator until a month after it arrived in port as recalled by matt tezyk westinghouse was then advised by enron in writing that the generator was rejected and that delivery had not occurred authors note matt to find cc of that letter g enrons assertions are that DDP was not satisfied ie delivery of the generator did not occur in accordance with the terms of the contract title ie ownership remains with siemenswestinghouse risk of loss remains with siemenswestinghouse xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx john plz assess the copy of the contract provided to you this afternoon under separate cover we request a legal opinion as to whether delivery in accordance with the contract of the CTUnit occurred or not plz call with any questions regards scott

nursing school our professor gave us a pop quiz I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questionsuntil I read the last one What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school Surely this was some kind of joke I had seen the cleaning woman several times She was tall darkhaired and in her s but how would I know her name I handed in my paper leaving the last question blank Just before class ended one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade Absolutely said the professor In your careers you will meet many people All are significant They deserve your attention and care even if all you do is smile and say hello Ive never forgotten that lesson I also learned her name was Dorothy Second Important Lesson Pickup in the Rain One night at PM an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride Soaking wet she decided to flag down the next car A young white man stopped to help her generally unheard of in those conflictfilled s The man took her to safety helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi cab She seemed to be in a big hurry but wrote down his address and thanked him Seven days went by and a knock came on the mans door To his surprise a giant console color TV was delivered to his home A special note was attached It read Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night The rain drenched not only my clothes but also my spirits Then you came along Because of you I was able to make it to my dying husbands bedside just before he passed away God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others Sincerely Mrs Nat King Cole Third Important Lesson Always remember those who serve In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less a year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table A waitress put a glass of water in front of him How much is an ice cream sundae he asked Fifty cents replied the waitress The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it Well how much is a plain dish of ice cream he inquired By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient Thirtyfive cents she brusquely replied The little boy again counted his coins Ill have the plain ice cream he said The waitress brought the ice cream put the bill on the table and walked away The boy finished the ice cream paid the cashier and left When the waitress came back she began to cry as she wiped down the table There placed neatly beside the empty dish were two nickels and five pennies You see he couldnt have the sundae because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip Fourth Important Lesson The Obstacle in Our Path In ancient times a King had a boulder placed on a roadway then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock Some of the kings wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables Upon approaching the boulder the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road After much pushing and straining he finally succeeded After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway The peasant learned what many of us never understand Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition Fifth Important Lesson Giving When it Counts Many years ago when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her year old brother who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness The doctor explained the situation to her little brother and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying Yes Ill do it if it will save her As the transfusion progressed he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled as we all did seeing the color returning to her cheeks Then his face grew pale and his smile faded He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice Will I start to die right away Being young the little boy had misunderstood the doctor he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her You see after all understanding and attitude are everything

occurred on or about jul enron representative frank cervenka went to CTSS ie the westinghouse facility here in houston on friday jul to inspect the combustion turbine during that inspection westinghouse employees informed him that the generator had salt water damage at the port as a result the following monday jul he visited the port of houston with the siemenswestinghouse insurance adjustor and saw the damaged generator note this was just a cursory visit to verify that in fact the unit had been damaged the full extent of the damage and impact on the project was not known at that time eg repair or replace were still viable options enron received formal notification faxed letter of the damaged generator on approx aug enron has already made progress payments to siemenswestinghouse in the amount of of the contract value of the gas turbine and generator DDP per incoterms means delivered duty paid Westinghouse despite prior requests from enron has not provided copies of the customs clearance documentation ie we dont know the exact date that the generator cleared customs or if it cleared customs title means ownership but does not imply either risk of loss or care custody and control with title comes both ownership and the responsibility for payment of taxes d info not known by enron when did ship come into port when did damage to generator occur when or if us customs duties were paid f info known by enron generator is a total loss as determined by westinghouse per section of contract enron was not given the formal opportunity to inspect the damaged generator until a month after it arrived in port as recalled by matt tezyk westinghouse was then advised by enron in writing that the generator was rejected and that delivery had not occurred authors note matt to find cc of that letter g enrons assertions are that DDP was not satisfied ie delivery of the generator did not occur in accordance with the terms of the contract title ie ownership remains with siemenswestinghouse risk of loss remains with siemenswestinghouse xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx john plz assess the copy of the contract provided to you this afternoon under separate cover we request a legal opinion as to whether delivery in accordance with the contract of the CTUnit occurred or not plz call with any questions regards scott

answer remains yes again must discuss with enas ben jacoby because of his commercial involvementexpectations If so I must provide proof of ownership of the damaged generator other than an email message Please provide ASAP comment what do you need while enron has made approx of the payments for the gas turbine generator unit it is likely that ownership still resides with westinghouse ie it was never delivered per the equipment purchase contract with enron again what type of documentation do you need does it matter if westinghouse is still in the loop further comment at this time title ownership care custody and control remain with westinghouse further westinghouse must continue to be in the loop because the monies for the damaged might ultimately be paid to them ie westinghouse provides enron with a new replacement generator then westinghouse receives the insurance money to cover their lossdamaged generator Is the generator to be repaired comment no the generator is not to be repaired instead a replacement generator is being manufactured in austria for westinghouse and is to be delivered to the port of houston in the midapril timeframe If so when and where comment na Underwriters surveyor needs to examine it when it is taken apart comment na The surveyor was told when he made an inspection at the Port that a detailed repair estimate would be provided to him on the other unit that was damaged and this would provide a guide as to the type of damage on our unit comment only the generator was damaged the gas turbine is complete and resides in houston i do not understand your comment about damage to another unit further comment the other unit does not belong to enron ie it belongs to another westinghouse client plz understand that the other unit was immersed deeper in salt water than our unit as a result its damage was greater in that we are getting a replacement generator we have to assume that the other unit that was also damaged is also being replaced therefore it can be inferred that the damage estimate for both generators are approximately the same To date nothing has been sent to our surveyor comment none further comment we are not sure about your statement our understanding is that you previously both communicated with and sent the accident survey of westinghouses underwriter to our surveyor As it has been over three months since the unit arrived in Houston in its damaged condition if Enron expects to collect from Enron cargo insurers we must move forward in providing the information previously requested or prejudice Enrons

MVIndustrialBridge Jim Sharron seems content with what you have provided regarding Enrons responsibility to insure etc Thank you She is now asking the following What is Enron claiming for response siemens westinghouse iswill be claiming for full and total loss of the generator a replacement generator is currently being manufactured in austria and will arrive in port of houston tx in the mid april timeframe we have a meeting sched with them next week well attempt to determine what the value of just the generator is from siemenswestinghouse ie we have a price for the gas turbine generator unit but not separate prices for just the gas turbine and the generator What is the financial extent of Enrons claim response plz refer to above comment It seems to me that the short answers to these questions would be The cost to repair the generator that Enron was supposed to receive from SWPC response again we are talking about a total loss and not just a repair plz see above Unknown until SWPC actually tears down the generator and determines the extent of damage and the cost to repair response again the generator will not be repaired therefore this question is na Those answers however will certainly provoke further questions such as When and where is SWPC going to tear down the unit inspect it and determine the repair costs response plz see prior email also the generator will not be repaired therefore this question is na Isnt the water damage just getting worse as the generator just sits there unopened with no measures taken to prevent further deterioration response plz understand that siemens westinghouse still has care custody and control of the damaged generator at this time siemens westinghouse considers the generator a total loss normally this would have been a great question however given the circumstances this question is na Jim if anyone can provide a response to Sharrons questions please let me know what you find out Thanks Thanks Ted Rosen PM Will this

from westinghouse in it they assert that title to the existing generator passed to enron upon delivery into the united states delivery occurred at houston on or about jul as required by the contract and incoterms risk of loss to the generator passed to enron when the generator arrived ddp at houston while the generator remained on board the common carrier the generator was delivered in an undamaged condition title and risk of loss passed to enron before the water damage to the generator occurred xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx b per the contract between enron and westinghouse section title to Equipment Title to the Equipment will pass to Purchaser immediately upon entry into the united states section risk of loss Seller shall bear the risk of loss and damage with respect to the Equipment until delivery of the Equipment to the Delivery Point in accordance with Section Seller shall be required to inspect the Equipment for damage at the Delivery Point section Seller shall cause the Equipment to be delivered to the Delivery Point on a DDP basis in accordance with Sections by the date set forth therein section Seller shall be responsible for delivering the CTUnit DDP to the iii us port of export by any means of transport section Seller shall perform customs clearance for the Equipment through us customs and pay any import duties section Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date Seller will cause the CTUnit authors note includes the generator to be delivered in an undamaged condition in accordance with the SpecificationCT to the Delivery Point DDP in accordance with Schedule I below the Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date authors note the date specified in the contract was later slipped per agreement with enron section Completion of Delivery delivery of the CTUnit to the Delivery Point shall be considered complete for the purposes of Delivery Liquidated Damages as it pertains to the delivery of Major Components authors note includes the GT and generator when the last Major Component of such CTUnit is delivered DDP to the Delivery Point in complete and undamaged condition Purchaser shall have the right to inspect the Equipment for condition of the Equipment upon actual delivery Purchaser reserves the right to reject damaged Equipment at any location however in the event a portion of the Equipment is damaged or defective upon delivery to the Delivery Point Purchaser after making an initial assessment of the damage or defect and consulting with Seller as to how such damage will affect the installation operation performance reliability efficiency and warranty of the damaged Equipment may either i reasonable determine that such damage or defect is such that the preceding criteria is so adversely affected that Purchaser cannot accept delivery of the damaged Equipment and declare that delivery has not occurred or ii after taking into account such criteria and Sellers proposed plan for correcting such damage or defect in accordance with Section declare that delivery has occurred in the event Purchaser discovers such a damage or defect it shall notify Seller of such as soon as practical c facts of the case as we know them common carrier ship carrying the generator supposedly arrived in port of houston approx jul ie that was the ships estimated time of arrival eta westinghouse is claiming that delivery occurred on or about jul enron representative frank cervenka went to CTSS ie the westinghouse facility here in houston on friday jul to inspect the combustion turbine during that inspection westinghouse employees informed him that the generator had salt water damage at the port as a result the following monday jul he visited the port of houston with the siemenswestinghouse insurance adjustor and saw the damaged generator note this was just a cursory visit to verify that in fact the unit had been damaged the full extent of the damage and impact on the project was not known at that time eg repair or replace were still viable options enron received formal notification faxed letter of the damaged generator on approx aug enron has already made progress payments to siemenswestinghouse in the amount of of the contract value of the gas turbine and generator DDP per incoterms means delivered duty paid Westinghouse despite prior requests from enron has not provided copies of the customs clearance documentation ie we dont know the exact date that the generator cleared customs or if it cleared customs title means ownership but does not imply either risk of loss or care custody and control with title comes both ownership and the responsibility for payment of taxes d info not known by enron when did ship come into port when did damage to generator occur when or if us customs duties were paid f info known by enron generator is a total loss as determined by westinghouse per section of contract enron was not given the formal opportunity to inspect the damaged generator until a month after it arrived in port as recalled by matt tezyk westinghouse was then advised by enron in writing that the generator was rejected and that delivery had not occurred authors note matt to find cc of that letter g enrons assertions are that DDP was not satisfied ie delivery of the generator did not occur in accordance with the terms of the contract title ie ownership remains with siemenswestinghouse risk of loss remains with siemenswestinghouse xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx john plz assess the copy of the contract provided to you this afternoon under separate cover we request a legal opinion as to whether delivery in accordance with the contract of the CTUnit occurred or not plz call with any questions regards scott
