email is in reference to our meeting today regarding the following issues Meeting with Mark Braemer to discuss subjective inputs to your credit models to be released this summer Your willingness to let us use some of your data in files on the th floor to experiment with Moodys RiskCalc In the near future I would love to meet with Mark and some of the model developers to learn more about their modeling process especially the subjective component Please let me know how I can contact Mark and any relevant parties Also thank you in advance for allowing Kyriakos access to your files on the th floor We will contact you on Tuesday morning to find out when it is convenient for him to come down More specifically to evaluate Moodys RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enrons North American private firm counterparties Fiscal Year The prior twelve months of financial data are represented Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables such as cost of goods sold net income sales and EBIT The value should be a fourdigit integer year without mention of the day or month such as or Forecasts until the year can be made A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last years inflation level In general this estimation error will not cause any great problems as size affects default rates at very large scales eg vs makes a significant difference vs does not Cash Equivalents This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities Inventory Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet in thousands dollars without any alterations for accounting method eg LIFO FIFO Average Cost This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue Specifically this would include purchase cost sales cost sales taxes transportation costs insurance costs and storage costs Current Assets This item primarily represents cash inventories accounts receivables marketable securities and other current assets Total Assets Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars For example should be entered as Specifically total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property plant and equipment plus other noncurrent assets including intangible assets deferred items and investments and advances Leave previous years total assets blank for Australian companies Current Liabilities Liabilities are positive values Included in current liabilities are shortterm debt accounts payable and other current liabilities Total Liabilities This balance sheet account total liabilities is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus longterm debt plus other noncurrent liabilities including deferred taxes investment tax credit and minority interest Retained Earnings Retained Earnings a historical measure of performance is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders Typically it is the prior years retained earnings plus net income less distributions Retained earnings are generally positive Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings Leave this field blank for Australian companies Sales This item consists of the industry segments gross sales the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period reduced by cash discounts trade discounts and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers Cost of Goods Sold Entered in thousands of dollars this value is generally a positive number less than sales It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production such as material labor and overhead Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling General and Administrative Expenses Leave this field blank for Australian companies EBIT Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income Interest Expense This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short and longterm debt Typically we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities One measure of computing this is Interest Expense total liabilities Net Income This item represents the income or loss reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations A loss is represented by a negative sign For example a loss would be entered as Leave previous years net income blank for Australian companies Extraordinary Items Positive or negative this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations These items include extraordinary gainslosses income loss from discontinued operations and cumulative affect of accounting changes Expenses are entered as negative values gains as positive values Leave previous years extraordinary items blank for Australian companies Country This model is calibrated for the United States Canada and Australia Thanks for your assistance Iris

AM To Kaminski Vince J Subject FW Energy Leader Consulting Generation Evaluator EGE Vince This is the gentleman that wants to meet with you on the th Original Message From Steve Mitnick ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESSteveMitnickCSMitnickearthlinkEnetE NRONcom Sent Monday May AM To Crenshaw Shirley Cc Subject Energy Leader Consulting Generation Evaluator EGE Shirley As requested herein is information regarding the meeting with Vince Kaminski The presentation on the EGE tools applications and the Allegheny Energy case study is timed to take an hour If the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for Tuesday May might I request it be set for late afternoon as my other appointments are the next day And as Vince will recall I was CoLeader of the energy consulting business of PHB Hagler Bailly and developer of the Ramp Up Real Time check and Electric Strategy tools Presently I am CEO of Energy Leader Consulting ELC Background The US power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years Rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively Utilities who still control most power plants endeavor to adopt the entrants methods Yet inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread Utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decadesold habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling Many utilities notwithstanding the industrywide trend towards profit maximization cling to ingrained routines Inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale A utility may operate a relatively small system fewer than a dozen plants A small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers playing the wholesale market at the margin For a variety of reasons utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units let alone shut down any even temporarily or seasonally Economically inefficient units continue to be committed week after week and run in the halfload range EGE Objectives EGE identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines Taking into account transmission and reliability factors the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant I An industry participant can use EGE as a basis for a medium or longterm wholesale power transaction with a utility or to price wholesale power more aggressively to take market share from the utility ie compel changes in unit commitment habits II An industry participant can use EGE to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition III A power plant developer can use EGE to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utilitys unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized Specific EGE Concepts EGE reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities It produces indicative statistics such as a the frequency distribution of starts per week b the frequency distribution of starts by dayminute segment during the week c the frequency distribution of load level d the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start e average heat rate and approximate fullyallocated cost in the halfload range f average ramp rate from the halfload range g the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours and h forcedoff maintenance outage rate where indicated Indicative statistics are generally aggregated by monthyear in some cases by temperature range They can be by regional wholesale prices as well EGE establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years EGE is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data EGE is now updated for the th quarter through December EGE st quarter through March will be available approximately June EGE also compares and ranks generating units commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility as well as other regional generators Some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the halfload level for lengthy time periods without an apparent reliability basis splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units Other EGE supporting data i planned maintenance schedule where indicated j actual maximum generating capacity k actual minimum generating capacity actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from governmentreported values l average heat rate in the fullload range and m average heat rate in the threequarterload range With respect to a generating units average heat rate in the halfload threequarterload and fullload ranges it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region It can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities and changes in recent years in these parameters The RealWorld Example of Allegheny Energy Allegheny Energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of EGE In the th quarter for instance one highcost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning times and committed for the whole day in all but two cases Arguably there are power products that could substitute for this routine in part at least at a profit to the seller of the product and Allegheny Energy Another highcost Allegheny Energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn nine times and committed for most of the coming week At another plant two highcost units were operated too often in the expensive halfload range some hours and threequarterload range another to hours they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels Again there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to Allegheny Energy Offering of Energy Leader Consulting ELC EGE is a procedure not a software package or data base ELC believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities ELC transfers its knowledge about the EGE procedure and the supporting data methods in a straightforward fourstep process Enron would select one to three target utilities ELC would perform the EGE procedure on the target utilities Employing this realworld analysis as a pedagogic tool ELC in a oneday seminar with Enron personnel would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future without the assistance of ELC Optionally ELC would provide EGE supporting data quarterly to Enron The basic EGE supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program virtually all fossil fuel units Parameters that are incorporated and the data set format will be specified upon request Custom modifications will be considered

Company at Singapore remained inconclusive on Tuesday and are slated to continue on Wednesday The meeting has spilled o ver to the second day with DPC to participate in the proceedings on Wednesd ay financial institutions sources said The sources said Enron India mana ging director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor were likely to p articipate in the second day of the meeting They said the meeting which w ent on for over an hour discussed the ongoing financial and legal disputes between DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board Nothing has been finalised as yet they said when asked whether both the Indian and foreig n lenders were able to arrive at any solution for solving the current statu s quo At the Singapore meet the lenders have come together to try and dif fuse the tension and unite the two warring partners DPC and MSEB The foreign lenders were expected to be updated by their Indian counterpart s about developments like DPCs preliminary termination notice to MSEB whi ch in retaliation rescinded the PPA and stopped drawing power from the mult inational from May The Indian lenders would press for completion of the billion project as DPC has stopped commercial production and doubts ar e being expressed for commissioning of its mw phaseII due on Thursd ay The Indian team is led by Industrial Development Bank of India executiv e director R S Agarwal who is also DPC board member along with representa tives of State Bank of India and ICICI The foreign lenders include a conso rtium led by ABNAmro Citibank NA Japan Exim Bank and Opic PTI THE TIMES OF INDIA Wednesday June Lenders split over DPC transfer notice to MSEB Pradipta Bagchi Lenders to the billion Dabhol Power Company are split over whether DP C should be allowed to issue a transfer notice to MSEB Last Friday Enron sought the lenders permissionfor the second time in a monthto issue a transfer notice to MSEB A transfer notice allows the valuation of all fixe d assets to begin with and is the first step in starting the process of tra nsfer of assets to the MSEB While domestic lenders like IDBI ICICI and SB Iwith an exposure of more than Rs crore to the projectare opposin g the move to issue a transfer notice most foreign lenders including the l ead arrangers to the project are now agreeable to the transfer notice being issued by the DPC On the first day of lenders deliberations in Singapore vast differences emerged between the domestic and foreign lenders in this regard While domestic lenders are worried about the impact of the huge exposure on their balance sheets foreign lenders who typically have smaller exposure are of the opinion that without any alternative concrete solutions it ma y be worthwhile to pull the plug on the project Without any concrete sol utions and no fixed timeframe foreign lenders are not willing to go to th eir respective credit committees for further disbursals a lender from Si ngapore told The Times of India There is no point throwing more good mon ey after bad is the consensus among foreign lenders said the lender Among other issues discussed on the first day of the meetings was whether t he lenders should throw Enron out of the project and take over the operatio ns of DPC However without a proper team of skilled managers in place it is unlikely that the lenders will risk throwing out the current operators Fresh disbursals from the lenders are unlikely Among the first casualties will be an Enron affiliate company which is the EPC contractor for the LNG terminal On June a payment of million is to be made to the LNG co ntractor which will not be disbursed by the lenders Another big payment o f million has to be made to Bechtel the EPC contractor for the power plant by June as well Enron and DPC officials will make a presentation on Wednesday to the banker s following which further deliberations will be held among the lending ba nks THE INDIAN EXPRESS Wednesday June DPC lenders meet opens on a positive note The first day of the crucial meeting between the Indian and international l enders in Singapore has opened on a positive note with the foreign lenders showing signs of giving more time to Indian government to resolve the probl em Foreign lenders are enthused by the fact that the Centre is ready to give i ncentives to the project so that DPC can reduce its tariff The Centre pac kage include cutting interest rate on the project and asking the Central E lectricity Authority CEA to work out a contingency plan for sale of power to other States from the Dabhol power projectThe international lenders are ready to give some more time to find out a solution Lenders will take the maximum hit if the Enron pulls the plug into the project FI sources said Hence the rethinking among the international lenders The Centres p ackage to be ready in another two months would also lower the customs dut y on imported LNG which would further help the company to lower the tariff Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor are likely to participate in the second day of the meeting on Wednesday to present their side of the story Tuesdays meeting which went on for over an hour discussed the ongoing financial and legal disputes between DPC an d its partner Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEBAt the meet the l enders have come together to try and diffuse escalated tension and unite th e two warring partners DPC and MSEB say FI sources While loans from international FIs enjoy the Indian government guarantee i t would be Indian FIs which will have to take the maximum hit if the projec t gets derailed On Tuesday the foreign lenders were updated by the Indian counterparts over series of events like DPCs Preliminary Termination Noti ce to MSEB which in retaliation rescinded the PPA and stopped drawing powe r from the multinational from May The Indian team is led by Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI executive director R S Agarwal who is als o DPC board member along with representatives of State Bank of India and I CICI The foreign lenders include a consortium led by ABNAmro Citibank NA Japan Exim bank and OPIC Sanjay Jog The Central Electricity Authority CEA has launched an exercise to assess the viability of despatch of Dabhol power to various power deficit states across the country announced the Union minister of state for power Jayavan tiben on Tuesday Mehta said that the CEA which has been asked to undertak e this exercise recently will take into account the burden to be borne by various power deficit states during the despatch of power Currently if th e power has to be transported from eastern grid to western grid there is c ertain fixed charge imposed on it The CEA will have to carry out this exe rcise at length so that the exact picture will emerge whether or not the Da bhol power despatch is viable and whether the states are keen to purchase t hat power the minister added Mehta said that the centre will not purchas e Dabhol power as its undertakings cannot take the additional burden on the m She informed that the union finance ministry in no uncertain terms made it clear that the centre cannot purchase Dabhol power and sell it at cheape r rate to the states especially when these states owe over Rs crore to various central public sector undertakings Mehta said that prime minist er AB Vajpayee who has been apprised him of the present situation on the Da bhol front has assured to provide necessary assistance especially technical one to resolve the issue THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Wednesday June DPC lenders to resume talks today in Singapore THE twoday talks to resolve Dabhol tangle opened on a positive note in Si ngapore on TuesdaySources in Indian financial institutions IFIs told The Financial Express that the IFIs comprising representatives of IDBI ICICI State Bank of India SBI met to chalk out their strategy at the twoday m eeting with offshore lenders and Enron officials The Indian team was lead by Mr RS Agarwal IDBI executive director along with the other officials f rom other lending institutions including those from the SBI and ICICIAppar ently the IFIs on Tuesday revived their efforts to convince DPCs offshor e lenders to maintain restraint to save the Dabhol project The meeting b etween the IFIs and their foreign counterparts remained inconclussive on Tu esday The foreign lenders are expected to take a clear stand on Wednesday Interestingly the meeting is expected to be participated by members of the DPC on the second day said financial institutions sources The sources sa id Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGre gor are likely to participate in the second day of the meeting The meeting was also attended by a consortium led by ABNAmro Citibank NA Japan Exim Bank and OPIC According to sources in IDBI The foreign lenders have giv en us a patient hearing to our views suggesting that they should not precip itate the crisis by any of their further moves The sources said the IFIs are determined to take up the issue of completion of the Dabhol phaseII in view of per cent of its completion The IDBI has recieved a mandate fr om the government that an allout effort be made to save the Dabhol project the sources added The offshore lenders are believed to have sought various details with refer ence to the payment guarantees from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB as well as fulfilment of contractual obligations in the wake of rev oking of the power purchase agreement The IFIs are likely to press for the revocation of suspension of loan disbursement by offshore lenders so that phaseII be completed The offshore lenders had suspended loan disbursement after the DPC board meeting of London on April BUSINESS STANDARD Wednesday June MSEB refuses DPC power at PLF Renni Abraham The Maharashtra government will not buy power from the first phase of the Dabhol Power Companys DPC project at a per cent plant load factor PL F a senior state government official said here today The statement repre sents a hardening of Maharashtras position on talks with DPC and virtually kills the latters proposal to split tariffs for the Centre and Maharashtr a The Maharashtra State Electri city Board MSEB is now required to buy per cent of the power generated by the first phase mw of the proje ct But during negotiations with the Godbole Committee it has been demandi ng that the requirement be cut to per cent At the last Godbole Committe e meeting DPC had put forward a plan to split tariffs for the Centre and M aharashtra with the Centre paying Rs per unit of power and MSEB payin g Rs The Centre DPC suggested could buy twothirds of the power it generated once the second phase mw taking the total capacity to mw was completed Maharashtras latest position undermines DPCs proposal since t he Enronpromoted companys tariff hinges on MSEB absorbing per cent of the power it generates in the first phase A senior state government offici al said The Centre has been talking a lot about playing the role of a fac ilitator What we need is a buyer for the second phase Despite recent cen tral government pronouncements state government officials privately argue that the Centre is not playing an active role in resolving the problems tha t have plagued the DPC project At the very first Godbole Committee meeting he attended the Centres nominee AV Gokak adopted a noncommittal stand The Maharashtra government official added Gokak said he was merely atte nding the meeting in the capacity of a messenger and would communicate to t he Centre any solution worked out by the renegotiation committee The Union power ministry has stated that a solution worked out by the renegotiation committee would be acceptable to it Unless the Centre takes an active part and assures the offtake of the second phase no solution can be worked out THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE Wednesday June Dabhol says ready to extend conciliation Shaji Vikraman Balaji C Mouli THE Dabhol Power Company DPC has accepted the Finance Ministrys proposal for a two months extension for the conciliation process The extension wi ll be effective from June This development is perceived by the Governmen t as a positive signal as it offers more leeway to work out a solution to r esolve the Dabhol crisis DPCs nod for an extension which was communicate d to the Finance Secretary on Monday is subject to the Government acceding to the companys stand on the ongoing arbitration proceedings The company has said that it would continue to pursue the arbitration proceedings whic h have already been initiated by the company according to senior Ministry officials Under the power purchase agreement PPA conciliation and arbit ration are two methods under the contract to resolve disputes between the t wo parties Normally arbitration is resorted to only after conciliation fa ils However in this case DPC has dragged MSEB to the arbitration forum e ven as the conciliation process is being pursued DPC has already slapped three arbitration notices on the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB The first notice was issued to the board for its failure to honour the December bill of Rs crore and the January bill of Rs crore while two other notices were for failures to hono ur the Maharashtra Governments State support agreement and the supplementa ry State support agreement The conciliation process was adopted in the wak e of the dispute arising over the settlement of DPCs December bills of Rs crore followed by the MSEBs counter claim of Rs crore for the sam e period The conciliation process was agreed upon on April and was to be concluded in two months However simultaneously arbitration proceedings were trigg ered between DPC and MSEB With the conciliation process making little head way the Finance Ministry sought an additional two months time for concludi ng the process Prior to that the Attorney Generals interpretation of the MSEBDPC contract was that the payment could be made to DPC only if the bi ll was undisputed Hence the Centre decided to opt for the conciliation pr ocess During recent meetings between the Government and the DPC officials the la tter had pointed out that if the Government was able to work out a package in six months it would withdraw its termination notice and reamin in the p roject for up to a year The Finance Ministry officials feel that the Centr e has been dragged into the DPC controversy well beyond its contractual obl igation The Centres involvement in DPCMSEB issue is restricted to the first phase The fate of the second phase is entirely a matter between the MSEB and DPCthey said Analysts feel that the Power Minister Mr Suresh Prabhus words of hope to defuse the Dabhol crisis are not grounded in reality The Centre is totti ng sale of Dabhol power to thirdparty as a key solution However first u nder the existing electricity laws the Centre cannot authorise thirdparty sale since it is in the States domain Secondly since it is a purely com mercial decision the Central Electricity Authoritys CEA intervention do es not offer any significant breakthrough Recently the Power Ministry h ad instructed the CEA to survey the demand requirement of neighbouring Stat es over the next two years as well as their purchase price THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE Wednesday June MSEB unruffled amid power talk Dinesh Narayanan EVEN as officials from various financial institutions and banks split hairs in Singapore on whether to sink or sail with the Dabhol power project the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB is cool about the entire affair Unlike previous instances when the odds were stacked against it this tim e MSEB knows pretty well that whatever happens it will remain unscathed I f someone has to take a hit it has to be the financiers and maybe the Gove rnmentsAt the hearing before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Author ity MERC the AdvocateGeneral Mr Goolam Vahanvati had said on behalf o f the board that MSEB was being kind towards Enron when it rescinded the co ntract for material misrepresentation One more step and its fraud h e had told MERC Knowing this fully well MSEB has kept its cool throughout the altercation It firmly believes that if nothing else it can pin down the company on ju st this one point at any forum Enron too has not said at any point of time that it can actually perform as per the coldstart graph in the power purchase agreement In fact it has said such performance making availab le full power in minutes is not possible by any such plant in th e world In a way it was MSEBs defiant posturing coupled with the Maharas htra Governments passing the buck up that got the Central Government to ac t One thing evident throughout the crisis is that all the players are trying to save their own skin In spite of the developments Enron has played its cards close to its chest and hinted to institutions at taking a hit on its returns only a few days ago Even that Mr Wade Cline Managing Director Enron India Pvt Ltd is reported to have told Indian lenders would hinge o n substantial give and take Indian lenders have a genuine case in that the y are the ones without any assurances apart from the plant itself And the y are not in the business of running power plants They cannot do much exce pt try get the players to somehow shake hands They had tried to convince t he Government some time ago to get MSEB to activate the escrow and increase the letter of credit amount But they were told off by MSEB which was in n o mood to relent Todays meeting in Singapore remained inconclusive and th e talks will continue tomorrow Tomorrow Enron will make presentations to lenders at Singapore on what it feels can be done to move ahead Whatever t he outcome of the meeting MSEB is unlikely to agree to anything that might queer its pitch THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Wednesday June CEA to assess viability of Dabhol power despatch to various states San jay Jog THE Central Electricity Authority CEA has launched an exercise to assess the viability of the despatch of Dabhol power to various power deficit stat es across the country Union minister of state for power Jayavantiben Meht a on Tuesday Ms Mehta told The Financial Express that the CEA which has b een asked to undertake this exercise recently will take into account the b urden to be borne by various power deficit states during the despatch of po wer Currently if the power has to be transported from eastern grid to wes tern grid there is a certain fixed charge imposed on it The CEA will hav e to carry out this exercise at length so that the exact picture will emerg e whether or not the Dabhol power despatch is viable and whether the states are keen to purchase that power the minister added Ms Mehta said that t he Centre will not purchase Dabhol power as its undertakings cannot take th e additional burden on them She informed that the Union finance ministry had in no uncertain terms made it clear that the Centre cannot purchase Dabhol power and sell it at cheap er rate to the states especially when these states owe over Rs cror e to various Central public sector undertakings Ms Mehta said that Prime M inister Atal Behari Vajpayee who has been apprised of the present situatio n on the Dabhol front has assured that he would provide necessary assistan ce especially technical to resolve the issue The Centre is quite eager for the resolution of issue and will provide necessary cooperation she ad ded Ms Mehta said that she had a meeting with the representatives of the Bank o f America and ABN Amro before they left for the Singapore meeting These l enders explained their position and the amount involved in the Dabhol plant However they also expressed their wish to participate in finding an acce ptable wayout she added THE ASIAN AGE Wednesday June

specialists or dealers who have monopoly power to set prices bids and asks for a given asset but who face indirec t competition from other specialists who trade in related assets In the co ntext of a simple model where investors have meanvariance preferences we characterize the equilibrium bids and asks quoted by K specialists in N ass ets where some specialists may control more than one asset We compare the equilibrium spreads as the number and factor structure of the assets eac h specialist controls is varied It is shown that for some constellations o f initial portfolio holdings and asset covariance it is socially preferred to have competing specialists while for others it is socially preferred to have their actions coordinated or to have one specialist control several assets In a simple factor model we show how the optimal specialist contr ol structure depends on whether the assets trade as substitutes or compleme nts In some situations it is beneficial to have specialist
