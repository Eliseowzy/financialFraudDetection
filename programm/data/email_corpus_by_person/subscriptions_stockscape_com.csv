was previously distributed to Fagan Report Trade Alert Subscribers at the above noted time and date Due to everchanging market considerations it may or may not be applicable at this time TRADE ALERT Speculative Buy Guidant Corporation NYSE GDT currently trading at with a target above and a stop loss at Guidant Corporation GDT is a global leader in the medical technology industry providing innovative minimally invasive and costeffective products and services for the treatment of cardiovascular and vascular disease In short GDT is involved with just about everything and anything used to prevent and treat heart attacks With over employees worldwide it posted revenues in excess of billion for FY Net earnings after tax were million Earnings per share came in at on a fully diluted capitalization of issued shares Q numbers for the three month period ended March are on track to produce similar or slightly better results for FY Working capital at March was million Total current and long term liabilities were billion of which million is expected to be paid off from cash flow during FY At its current price of it has a PE of The only way to understand GDT is to spend an hour or two on its website wwwguidantcom My thinking on this trade is that GDT will more than likely produce better numbers this year than it did last year Yet at its current price of it is trading about less than its low of If it gets back to there will be a gain on the trade GDTs week highlow stock price is As money continues to rotate out of the tech sector and other economy sensitive stocks established medical companies like GDT should trade higher Some subscribers get extra nervous trading higher priced stocks like GDT Remember that price is not an important consideration The only considerations that matter are the dollar amount of the trade and the resulting percentage gain or loss If you normally limit your trades to per transaction thats fine Buy shares of GDT We have a stop loss limit on this trade so you are risking about The next reporting period for GDT is for the threemonth period ending June If the numbers come in better than expected we could make to in to days Id be very happy with that on this trade SUBSEQUENT NOTE Wednesday morning June a day after this Trade Alert was issued CNBC reported that Bank of America had just released a Buy recommendation on Johnson Johnson One of the reasons given for the recommendation was that JJ has increased its market share of the heart surgical stent market at the expense of GDT I think that is the reason for the weakness in todays
