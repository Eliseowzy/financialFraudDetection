Executive or BW JAN PACIFIC EASTERN BWTXINDUSTRIALINFORES Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Design Pushes Renewed Interest in Worldwide Nuclear Power Generation in an Advisory by Industrialinfocom BusinessEnergy Editors HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREJan The following is an advisory by Industrialinfocom Industrial Information Resources Inc Houston The rehabilitation of nuclear power generation plants which could represent part of the answer to worlds power generation needs over the next years has taken a few steps forward in the consciousness of governments and industry in the past six months However nuclear power still has a way to go among environmental groups and those involved with postChernobyl public health concerns The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor PBMR from Eskom in South Africa continues to claim the attention of both the large power hungry regions and the capital conscious development areas to which the modular and smaller output plant could be both affordable and appropriate Stakeholders in the project include the US company Exelon with Eskom with British Nuclear Fuels with Industrial Development Corporation of SA with and Black empowerment at Currently Exelon is negotiating for the possible purchase of PBMRs at a price of around billion USD Early in the company requested the US National Regulatory Commission to start laying the groundwork for PBMR licensing Exelon would like to see the million demonstration unit which is planned by Eskom in South Africa as a proven model to show that all technical matters have been resolved and that safety efficiency and viability are proven enough for US regulatory agencies to proceed forward with licensing The plant is to be built alongside the existing nuclear power station at Koeberg in the Cape Province of South Africa with work commencing in If approved Exelon may then start concurrent construction of US sites to bring PBMRgenerated power to market at the earliest possible date and at the best price Specifications and claims by Eskom who purchased the technology after a year development and proving period in Germany present the PBMR as small safe clean cost efficient inexpensive and adaptable The PBMR uses multiple coated uranium particles encased in graphite to form a fuel sphere mm in diameter The PBMR design makes use of helium as the coolant and energy transfer medium to a closed cycle gas turbine and generator The design differences between the PBMR and Pressurized Water Reactors result in the PBMR being a safe and economical power plant The annual world market for power generation is estimated at billion The PBMR if it comes through its regulatory trials would be in a position to capture a tasty slice of this power action With of the shareholding in the PBMR project reserved for new black empowerment shareholders plant export orders a year could contribute nearly billion a year to South Africas Gross Domestic Product and another billion in export income An estimated direct and indirect jobs would be created These figures would double and triple for or orders annually If the demo plant achieves its targets Eskom will place an order for modules with the Exelon order hopefully kicking in immediately for a possible date for the first US plant in Eskom will sell PBMRs as a manufactured item with no rights given Eighty percent of the costs will be made up of the manufactured reactor and site construction related The aim is for of the sourcing to come from South Africa Taxpayers money approximately million so far is being spent by the South African authorities in giving all due diligence to the studies and to public feedback on the project before the go decision is given With this right and proper concern and the considerable market presence of Eskom and Exelon the MW modules will no doubt play a crucial role in the future of nuclear power generation The project managers are indicating growing confidence in their ability to bring the product to market and have recently made a significant move A contract has been placed in midJanuary with the US company Stone Webster and South African construction company Murray Roberts and black empowerment contractor Proman Management Services to provide consulting services to the PBMR project in engineering procurement construction management and project management Following this development the PBMR management at Eskom have gone on record to state that with the multinational and multidisciplinary support now providing leverage the approval hurdles for the pilot project should be cleared by the end of given the crucial general diligence and environmental clearance by the government Industrailinfocom provides daily news related to the industrial market place including
