Laurie Lauer Kim Rathka Traci Rininger Jan Secor Faith UM Church Subject A Great Story THIS IS AN AWSOME MESSAGE BE BLESSED Six year old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents pancakes He found a big bowl and spoon pulled a chair to the counteropened the cupboard and pulled out the heavy flour cannister spilling it on the floor He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugarleaving a floury trail on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten Brandon was covered with flour and getting frustrated He wanted this to be something very good for Mom and Dad but it was getting very bad He didnt know what to do next whether to put it all into the oven or on the stoveand he didnt know how the stove worked Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and reached to push her away knocking the egg carton to the floor Frantically he tried to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs getting his pajamas white and sticky And just then he saw Dad standing at the door Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandons eyes All hed wanted to do was something good but hed made a terrible mess He was sure a scolding was coming maybe even a spanking But his father just watched him Thenwalking through the mess he picked up his crying son hugged him and loved him getting his own pajamas white and sticky in the process Thats how God deals with us We try to do something good in life but it turns into a mess Our marriage gets all sticky or we insult a friend or we cant stand our job or our health goes sour Sometimes we just stand there in tears because we cant think of anything else to do Thats when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us even though some of our mess gets all over Him But just because we might mess up we cant stop trying to make pancakes for God or for others Sooner or later well get it right and then theyll be glad we tried Please pass
