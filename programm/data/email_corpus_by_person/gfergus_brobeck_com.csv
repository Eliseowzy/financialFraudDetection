<30092347.1075853194740.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,gfergus@brobeck.com,2000-11-28 01:11:00,Revised Draft Response to PUC Cc AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and phone calls between Michael Day on behalf of the Enron Entities and yourself during the past few weeks Here is the current status as we understand it Based upon the agreements we reached between October and October date of your confirming email the Enron Entities have made the following document productions in response to the subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission the Commission October Bate Nos Enron Entities on behalf of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos October Bate Nos P on behalf of Portland General Responsive to Request Nos and November Bate No Enron Entities Diskette with EESEEMC retail data Responsive to Request Nos to to and November Bate No P Diskettes with Portland General Data which include approximate wholesale transactions Responsive to Request Nos to to and We believe with these productions we have complied with the October th agreement with respect to Portland General and EESEEMC As you know these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for EPMI as defined in our October th email available for production by October th However we were also mindful of your expressed expectation that any data provided be useful and reliable The collection of data you requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same location nor organized as you requested it In fact during our review of some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved we informed you of the problem We now understand that if we cannot give you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be available the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission FERC We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data immediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in the immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce accurate data Moreover during the interim between October th and today a number of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas served on the Enron entities First we understand that many other parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very sound legal grounds Second the Commission itself has without a hearing on the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes sought by other parties served Third the Commission has filed its motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited hearing and production schedule We note that the reasons stated in the motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to the Commissions own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas FERC has also issued its tentative order as of November covering some of the same topics as the Commissions subpoena request Finally FERC has requested information in specific areas from a number of entities including Enron Enron is simultaneously working on preparing responses to FERCs requests Originally the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept most favored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requests by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that was available However given both the Commissions stated urgent need for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite substantial effort date for production of reliable and accurate Transaction Data and the uncertainty created by the above described intervening events EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commissions threatened motion to compel before FERC We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been served with subpoenas We understand that there is a list for those entities that have been cooperating a list for those who have been delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their rights to challenge the subpoenas We understand that the Commission intends to punish by whatever means it has available those entities that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas We deplore these tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described above we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights If you have and questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me Sincerely Gary S Fergus This email message is for the

been filed even though the November draft order is not yet final Cal PX said they could not implement the software necessary to run the soft caps by January st The City San Diego requested rehearing on the issue of whether FERC has the authority to order refunds The City of San Diegos Friday filing said the SDGE had M in its balancing account that it would be seeking from ratepayers The City argued that because their were not just and reasonable rates the filed rate doctrine is not called into question Charles Dick I spoke with Charles Dick about his personal availability He told me that he understood we were asking for a personal commitment from him He has one matter that is set for arbitration in June that will take a significant amount of this time He has other matters but is willing to personally commit the time necessary for this engagement He had the same approach as in the interview not selling himself but being completely responsive David Noonan David called to tell me he had left messages for Richard but they had not connected yet In part it was because David was in deposition We discussed conflict issues at some length In the copper cases where he represents SCE they have a and share of the damages at issue Thus he is not acting as longstanding SCE counsel He said that he did not believe that he could get a written forward looking waiver since the general counsel does not see this representation as a current conflict He agreed however that he would be able to confirm that in the event that Enron and SCE become adverse while he would not be able to represent either entity in that litigation if he is still representing them in the copper litigation SCE would not claim that his continued representation of Enron in the nonadverse matters was a violation of the duty of loyalty David was going to continue to try and connect with Richard Larry Ruff Larry has reviewed the preliminary data that we were proposing to release to the PUC In particular I asked him to take the view of a regulator and use the data to show market power withholding electricity etc He told me that the data was not all that helpful in any of those regards First he found the same anomalies later in the year with respect to energy purchased and energy sold He also had some questions about the identity of various counterparties used in the system He found that the data did not include price by the hour instead only the hour aggregate To the extent that we want to understand what happened during peak periods we would need the detailed data We also discussed finding out what sources of public market data were available to understand what was happening in the market to compare the Enron data with Larry has completed the initial quick look that we asked for He will be in Australia for the next few months We have made arrangements for encrypted email etc to be available so that we may consult with him as needed Tariffs and FERC related Materials Jean asked for the reference to the legal requirement to submit a balanced schedule etc Peter Meringolo from our office gathered this material earlier and we include it below We also enclose Ron Carols brief that he sent us that challenges the penalty provisions of the ISO tariff That litigation has been ongoing for a number of years The requirement for EPMI to submit a balanced schedule is found in the ISO tariff at section A Scheduling Coordinator shall submit to the ISO only Balanced Schedules in the DayAhead Market and the HourAhead Market A Schedule shall be treated as a Balanced Schedule when aggregate Generation InterScheduling Coordinator Energy Trades whether purchases or sales and imports or exports to or from external Control Areas adjusted for Transmission Losses as appropriate equals aggregate forecast Demand with respect to all entities for which the Scheduling Coordinator schedules in each zone If a Scheduling Coordinator submits a Schedule that is not a Balanced Schedule the ISO shall reject that Schedule provided that Scheduling Coordinators shall have an opportunity to validate their schedules prior to the deadline for submission to the ISO by requesting such validation prior to the applicable deadline The ISO Market Monitoring Information Protocol MMIP sets forth the standards for Anomalous Market Behavior See MMIP Anomalous market behavior which is defined as behavior that departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or unexplained market outcomes Evidence of such behavior may be derived from a number of circumstances including withholding Generation capacity under circumstances in which it would normally be offered in a competitive market unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by Generators unusual trades or transactions pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions eg prices and bids that appear consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions and unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports form or exports to other markets and exchanges The MMIP also prohibits Gaming See MMIP Gaming or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs Protocols or Activity Rules or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion to the detriment of the efficiency of and of consumers in the ISO Markets Gaming may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity such as loop flow facility outages level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy imports from outofstate or actions or behaviors that may otherwise render the system and the ISO Markets vulnerable to price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency The ISO MMIP allows the ISO to do any of the following among other things as a result of an entitys Anomalous Market Behavior or Gaming impose such sanctions or penalties as it believes necessary and as are permitted under the ISO Tariff See MMIP refer to such regulatory or antitrust agency as it sees fit to recommend the imposition of sanctions and penalties See MMIP publicize in whatever medium it believes most appropriate the activities or behavior of Market Participants in the ISO Markets revealed to have the effect of or potential for undermining the efficiency workability or reliability of the ISO Markets to give or to serve such Market Participants an unfair competitive advantage over other Market Participants See MMIP Ron Carrolls FERC Brief on MMIPs FERCbriefdoc Projects Under Way Collection of Basic Business

Investigation in Canada FYI dowjonesPDF EPMI Western Trading Desk Organization Chart Organizational chartPDF Change of Venue Research by Peter Meringolo Heres preliminary analysis of change of venue The court may change the venue of a trial where there is reason to believe that an impartial trial cannot be had therein CCP o b The party requesting a change of venue must show actual widespread prejudice extending over a long period of time Nguyen v Superior Court Cal App th Whether such a showing has been made is left to the discretion of the trial court Id Case law provides little guidance regarding how much evidence is enough for a party to show actual prejudice As Witkin states this challenge is so vague and difficult to sustain Witkin Cal Procedure Actions o th ed In fact a change of venue on these grounds has been granted in very few reported cases the most recent of which was in See People v Ocean Shore RR Cal App d San Joaquin and Kings River Canal and Irrigation Co v Stevinson Cal Ocean Shore was an eminent domain proceeding against defendant land owners to acquire lands to build a state highway one defendants motion for change of venue was granted People v Ocean Shore RR Cal App d The defendant filed nearly affidavits which referenced newspaper articles reports from civic meetings and statements by citizens showing a widespread prejudice against the defendants and its cause extending over a long period of years Id at The Court affirmed the trial courts discretion noting that the affidavits show that it would at least make it extremely doubtful whether an impartial trial could be had before a jury in that county Id at San Joaquin was a condemnation action for the use of waters of a river for the benefit of landowners on the west side of the river San Joaquin and Kings River Canal and Irrigation Co v Stevinson Cal In that action the defendant operated an irrigation system for the benefit of the landowners on the east side of the river Plaintiff filed one affidavit showing that the people on the east side of the river felt widespread prejudice against plaintiff and people on the west side of the river were disqualified as jurors because they were using defendants irrigation system Id at Defendant filed affidavits in opposition According to the Court if numbers of affiants or of affidavits were the determining factor in questions of this character the defendant herein would have been entitled to prevail upon said motion but this is not the rule Id at Rather the question is whether the trial court abused its discretion and the Court held that it did not These cases are contrasted with two case reported since in which change of venue motions were denied See Riverside County Flood Control and Water Conservation Dist v Joseph W Wolfskill Co Cal App d Nguyen v Superior Court Cal App th Riverside County was an eminent domain proceeding where plaintiff was seeking to condemn property for the purposes of flood control Defendants moved for a change of venue by presenting evidence that the advantages of the flood control project was widely publicized the newspapers portrayed defendants as trying to prevent flood controls that the cost of purchasing defendants property was to come from county funds and therefore every taxpayer was adverse to defendant Cal App d at Plaintiffs affidavit contradicted these facts The trial court denied the motion and this decision was affirmed on appeal Id at In Nguyen the State brought a suit against business owners in order to shut down a red light district in San Mateo The defendant businesses moved for a change of venue Defendants evidence consisted of two newspaper articles reporting the raid on the businesses that the city spent over investigating and one affidavit of an employee of defendants lawyer The trial court denied the motion because the evidence fell far short of proving actual prejudice Cal App th at Moreover the trial was to be a court trial not a jury trial and defendants showed no prejudice by the court Id Ross v Kalin Cal App although an extreme case exemplifies that a change of venue motion most likely requires a high standard of proof In Ross plaintiffs motion for change

Portland meeting was to find out whether or not there was a private right of action or prohibition of same under the Federal Power Act Here is Ron Carrolls response The courts have refused to create a private cause of action for violations of the FPA stating that the regulatory scheme created by Congress vested the regulatory body with the power to pursue enforcement See Clark v Gulf Oil Corp Fd pertaining to the recovery of losses due to allegedly unlawful rates under the NGA City of Gainesville v Florida Power Light Co F Supp SD Fla noting that the legislative history of the NGA which was modeled after the FPA does not suggest the existence of any private rights of action Dave Noonans Report on Defense Counsel Teleconference on Monday Chris Healy has just advised me that the call will

KirklandEllis LA Data Preservation Steve Hall and others have been working on making sure that the California AGs request to preserve evidence has been complied with EPMI will probably be extending the period that it keeps backup tapes making copies of hard drives from individual computers etc FERC Developments Secretary of Energy Richardson issued an emergency order requiring EPMI to market energy to the ISO In addition another emergency order was issued today I enclose the order and the press release The Press release for todays order is included below The FERC special meeting on California was videotaped by Nancy Pickover of Bracewell and is being sent to us corderpdf Califnoticepdf deccaorderpdf Dan Watkiss Analysis of FERC Order re Penalties for Refusal to sell Energy Last Friday the ISO filed with FERC Amendment No to its tariff Among other things the Amendment adds to the section of the tariff new provisions empowering the ISO to assess a penalty against Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency The penalty is stiff a charge for each MWh of the Dispatch instruction with which the Participating Generator does not comply equal to twice the highest price for Energy per MWh paid in each hour by the ISO to any other entity to produce Energy and if the ISO is required t call for the involuntary curtailment of firm Load to maintain Applicable Reliability Criteria during the System Emergency then an additional charge equal to for each MWh of the Dispatch instruction with which the Participating Generator does not comply The only defense to these penalties is to provide proof that the generating unit in question was physically incapable of running or it would have violated state or federal law to run it eg air emission allowance limits The ISO asked FERC for an immediate effective date of December which FERC granted in a December order The ISO Tariff defines Participating Seller or Generator to mean A generator or other seller of Energy or Ancillary Services through a Scheduling Coordinator over the ISO Controlled Grid and which has undertaken to be bound by the terms of the ISO Tariff If Enron is a Participating Generator Mary Hain informs me that Enron is not one then it risks incurring the new penalty if it fails to respond to an ISO order to sell ancillary services to the ISO I believe Enron might also risk incurring the penalty in cases where it controls or has rights to all or a portion of a generating capacity of a Participating Generators unit If that capacity is called on and the call is not answered because Enron is making some other use of the capacity the Enron may incur the penalty This seems to be contemplated by section of the Participating Generator Agreement which obliges a Participating Generator to comply with the tariff section by identifying the Generating Units that it owns operates or has a contractual entitlement to in Schedule as required by Section of the ISO Tariff emphasis added As far as I know it is that Schedule that the ISO consults when making decisions as to which Participating Generator to call on Thanks Gary This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and privileged

market RojoincmpltPDF California AG Investigation Here is a copy of my email to the California AG describing our agreement re preservation of data Rich As promised here is my summary outline of what we discussed regarding preservation of data In Portland we proposed to handle business email related to the topics in your preservation letter by instructing employees not to delete any email sent or received for hours Email that is personal and does not relate to the business topics you have identified can be kept discarded etc at the employees pleasure Each day there is a backup made that will capture the email in those employees mailboxes After hours each employee is free to manage their email box as they deem appropriate to the business needs eg keep discard From our conversation I understand that you agree that this is an acceptable procedure With respect to the hard drives on individual computers you would like to get an organizational chart for Portland that would enable us to discuss individuals computers that would be copied using ProQuest Drive Image Pro In addition there may be some other individuals that you would like to have us use a software product called Robocopy to copy files from their hard drives onto the network Until we figure out which computers to copy etc we will not begin this process We discussed that because of the holiday period it may not be practical to get this started until after the new year Outside of Portland we have proposed making a snapshot backup along business function lines reasonably called for by the subject matter of your request We propose not to backup any other business units or functions On a going forward basis those business functions that related to the subject matter of your request would be instructed not to delete business email We believe that relevant database backups have been and will continue to be made and preserved When an employee runs out of hard disk space on their computer it is an acceptable practice to copy files form their hard disk to the network where they will be backed up and then delete those copied files to make sufficient work space for the employee to work For EES I explained that their IT services are outsourced so we do not have as detailed information immediately available As I mentioned on the phone all of these discussions and efforts being made are done without waiving any objections that any of the Enron entities may have to your request including scope burden jurisdiction relevance privilege privacy vagueness etc and Enron specifically reserves each and every right and objection it or its employees may have Please let me know if your general understanding of our conversation is different than the above CPUC Subpoena Jeff Richter and Tim Belden have been working on getting the EPMI data correctly gathered They hope that by the middle of next week the Enron technical types will have figured out where all the data is and have assembled it for production Because Jeff Richter will be gone until after the New Year we will not be producing any data to the CPUC until early next year Jeff and Tim are focused on having a common set of reliable data that will be used for all subpoenas discovery requests etc We also discussed once we have the data collected that we use one of our experts to help with the analysis so that we are not creating files and records for which we will need to claim a privilege at a later point in time In other words since we are keeping the backup tapes for the systems in Portland any analytical work that Tim or Jeff do for us will be recorded on the backup tapes Tim Belden FYI Tim and his wife are expecting their first child with a due date of December th He will become out of pocket for a short time thereafter FERC Reporting A question arose regarding whether Enron needed to file a report to FERC concerning sales out of market that exceeded the soft caps This was a requirement that was requested by the ISO in an emergency application on December th The order granting the relief did not seem to include the reporting requirement The first cut at the data for the report showed that Enron made M over a weekend by buying power at and selling at A later cut at the data came up with a different answer When consulted by Christian Yoder and Steve Hall I made the unilateral decision not to file the report It was unclear whether we needed to do so and I had not seen and did not trust the data Later Dan Watkiss confirmed that he believed we did not need to file the report However beginning January th this report will have to be filed for sales over the soft cap Since this report requires a breakdown of costs vs sales price it is the same data that the PUC has been requesting and we anticipate will be requested in the litigation Tim Belden and Jeff Richter are working on a standard reporting method Hiring of Chief Operating Officer for ISO Tim Belden has been approached by the current Chief Operating officer of the ISO requesting a job Apparently the COO and the current ISO board are not getting along The issue raised by Tim to Mark Haedicke and Richard was whether they saw a problem with this hire One of the key issues would be what was the business purpose for the hire Obviously Enron does not want confidential ISO information from this person Also if this person will be a witness in the litigation there is a risk that if his testimony would be favorable to Enron it would be viewed as purchased On the other hand if his testimony would not be favorable at a time when he was employed by Enron that could be harmful There is also the question raised whether this is a bona fide request for employment or whether other motives could be in play Tim will be meeting with the COO on Friday He has instructions to make sure that he is not given any confidential data and that no commitment will be made then without consulting the litigation team Potential for Criminal Investigation The news of the investigation and all of our involvement has raised questions in the mind of some employees as to whether there is a risk of personal liability for them civil or criminal I reported that all we know is that there is an investigation under way by the California Attorney General We have no reason to believe right now that they are focused on Enron or that Enron or any employee is a target I said that at this stage of the investigation including our investigation we do not know enough facts to evaluate the risk for individual employees We have not reviewed the trader tapes to know what has been said on those tapes If we learn of facts that are specific to an employee Mark has asked that we notify him immediately We did provide some of this same information to traders we interviewed early in the process Analysis of EPMI data I have taken a look at the deviation of the ISO energy flow on a daily basis from its day ahead schedules and compared those deviations to EPMIs The source of the data is public information that was available to decision makers at the time The comparison shows that generally speaking the ISO was short in its projection by a magnitude of times the amount that EPMI was out of balance There are some exceptions but those are rare Approaching Federal Judge for More Time Dave Noonan has pointed out that we should look carefully at the assigned federal judge and decide who from the defense group locally in San Diego would be in the best position to make the motion Holiday Contact List Dave Noonan suggested and I concurred that it makes sense for all of you who receive this report to email me with your contact information and schedule over the holiday period I will have a composite list made up

<11946251.1075853199836.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,gfergus@brobeck.com,2001-01-02 11:29:00,Status Reportis the status of projects that I am aware of Enquiry into Removal Strategy for Berg Defendants I spoke with Rich Levy of Gibson Dunn Crutcher who represents SEMPRA in the Berg gaselectric class action filed in Los Angeles I asked him whether he would tell me if they were considering removal of the Berg action He told me that he had our removal papers He asked if we had any research that we were willing to share with him He said they looked at preemption filed rate doctrine ripeness etc and concluded that ultimately we would be in state court He also said that he did not believe there were any good motions to dismiss that were worth making I told him that some of the work product was a joint defense effort that would require permission to share eg the Paul Hastings memo but that there was other work product we might be willing to share that had been done on behalf of Enron I told him that I believed that there was good ninth circuit authority that was helpful and we really believed federal court was a better forum for these types of cases He told me he was willing to look at whatever authorities we could give him I also told him that I understood that Mike Weaver represented Sempra in the San Diego cases and gave him Mikes contact information He asked for copies of our complaints and I sent them on to him He is willing to discuss the case and possibly strategic alternatives He told me that El Paso had retained David Palmer formerly of Gibson Dunn to represent them in this action El Paso and David Palmer are supposedly meeting on Wednesday January rd According to Rich their time to remove expires on January th He told me that the Berg case was originally filed in Texas by the Denver law firm Astrella Rice against El Paso That case was dismissed because the plaintiff was not a direct purchaser The plaintiffs then sought to have Southern California Edison agree to be the named plaintiff Apparently they refused Rich said they were meeting with SCE to find out what else was said There is a second gas complaint the Continental Forge case Apparently this case was filed in September but never served It has now been amended and has been served A copy is attached We obtained this copy from the plaintiffs website so it does not have a signature for file stamp but Rich Levy said it was the complaint that had been served Continental Forgecmpltpdf PUC Hearings I do not have many of the details of the hearings other than a report from Mike Day that Michael Aguirre plaintiffs counsel in our case argued before the PUC that the real culprits are the power marketers and the solution to the utilities problem is for the utilities to join the plaintiffs class action in San Diego Apparently today Aguirre was cross examining the utility and generator witnesses before the PUC attempting to aid counsel for the ratepayers trying to show that the utilities should sue the power marketers Public Record Act Request Michael Aguirre has made a public record act request for all information subpoenaed by the PUC and any other documents related to alleged wrongdoing from the ISO The PUC has set January rd as the response date for comments on the request Data Provided by ISO to the PUC The ISO has told market participants that they have provided day ahead and hour ahead schedules to the PUC Bids actual metered operations RMR OOM and OOS calls generation out of service information and import and export schedules EPMI Data Jeff Richter reported today that he believes they now understand some of the data problems with the EPMI data I am scheduled to be in Portland with Jeff on Friday to resolve the data issues and discuss integration of ongoing data collection with pending and potential discovery requests Cornerstone Teleconference Dave Noonan reports that Michael Keeley at Cornerstone is very interested in being retained One of his partners has been contacted by another defendant but has not yet been retained by them yet Dave suggested that we try and do a telephone interview of Michael tomorrow and retain him if we like what we hear His CV is set forth below I will try to coordinate a time tomorrow morning AG Investigation So far the California AG has been reducing the scope of its data retention request For EES they basically wanted a snapshot and nothing else for the time being As for individual computers they want an organizational chart to select computers that they are interested in EPMI Tapes Prepared in Anticipation of Litigation We are awaiting specific model information about the Nicelog taping system used in Portland Dan Dietrich in IT in Houston is getting that information for us We believe we will have access to some technology that will assist in the review of these materials We will also distribute shortly the results of our research on the production of such materials and any exact transcripts prepared of those litigation materials Current Trading Practices Christian Yoder Steve Hall Marcus Woods Alan Comnes Dan Watkiss Richard Sanders and myself discussed current trading practices in the out of market and over cap scenarios In short if the ISO calls for power minutes before the hour it is needed there is no cap In some instances EPMI will have purchased power for x and offer to sell it to the ISO at x The plus factor being the credit risk andor the refund risk for having sold that power in addition to prevailing market conditions In the over cap situation EPMI will be collecting its cost data to compare with the prices charged the ISO or PX EPMI will be matching its ISO and PX sales data with comparable high cost energy in its portfolio This is consistent with FERC preexisting practice We also discussed standard instructions to traders Price Gouging Statute Richard Sanders has asked that we revisit the California Price Gouging Statute in view of the current trading practices California Penal Code section prohibits price increases upon the proclamation of a state of emergency by the President Governor or executive officer of any county or city resulting from a natural or manmade disaster For thirty days after such a proclamation it is unlawful for any business to sell or offer to sell any consumer goods goods or services used for emergency cleanup for a price of more than percent above the price charged by that person for those goods or services immediately prior to the proclamation of emergency Such a violation is a misdemeanor punishable by one year of jail time and a fine of up to A violation also constitutes an unlawful business practice under section It is unclear whether this statute includes the sale of electricity and or the declaration of a state of emergency by the ISO Ed Kee Engagement Letter Mike Kirby forwarded the form of engagement letter from Ed Kee Charles River Engagement Letter I have been in discussions with Charles River over the form of the engagement letter I hope to have that resolved shortly Thanks Gary Michael Keeley Senior Vice President Menlo Park Office El Camino Real Menlo Park CA mailto

<2200615.1075853214147.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,gfergus@brobeck.com,2001-04-10 05:59:00,False Claims Actis the quick overview of the false claims act in California Keep in mind that the California AG has offered a bounty or more for information leading to successful false claims act cases that show that wholesale prices were too high Thanks Gary Original Message From Smith Amanda D Sent Tuesday April PM To Fergus Gary S Subject False Claims Act Gary This is a brief description of the relevant provisions of the California False Claims Act As we discussed a more indepth analysis will follow in memo form Amanda The California False Claims Act CFCA available at California Government Code Section et seq provides that any person natural person corporation firm etc who commits various acts shall be liable to the state or political subdivision city county etc for treble damages sustained because of those acts That person may also be liable for a civil penalty of up to for each false claim and for the costs of any civil action brought to recover any penalties or damages Initially the CFCA defines claim as including any request or demand for money property or services made to any employee officer or agent of the state or of any political subdivision or to any contractor grantee or other recipient whether under contract or not if any portion of the money property or services requested or demanded issued from or was provided by the state or by any political subdivision thereof The CFCA then describes those acts which subject a person to treble damages The covered acts potentially relevant to Enron are Knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to an officer or employee of the state or of any political subdivision thereof a false claim for payment or approval Sec a Knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to get a false claim paid or approved by the state or by any political subdivision Sec a Conspiring to defraud the state or any political subdivision by getting a false claim allowed or paid by the state or by any political subdivision Sec a Having possession custody or control of public property or money used or to be used by the state or by any political subdivision and knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered less property than the amount for which the person receives a certificate or receipt Sec a Knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to conceal avoid or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the state or to any political subdivision Sec a Being a beneficiary of an inadvertent submission of a false claim to the state or a political subdivision who subsequently discovers the falsity of the claim and fails to disclose the false claim to the state or the political subdivision within a reasonable time after discovery of the false claim Sec a Section of the CFCA provides inter alia that a person a qui tam plaintiff may bring a civil action for a violation of this article for the person and either for the State of California in the name of the state if any state funds are involved or for a political subdivision in the name of the political subdivision if political subdivision funds are exclusively involved Once filed the action may be dismissed only with the written consent of the court taking into account the best interests of the parties involved and the public purposes behind this act Section goes on to describe the procedures whereby the State or a Political Subdivision may intervene in a suit filed by a qui tam plaintiff and how the damages recovered in such a suit shall be divided Several other provisions of Section could be extremely important When a qui tam plaintiff brings an action under this subdivision no other person qui tam plaintiff may bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action Sec c A qui tam plaintiff may not bring an action that is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the state or political subdivision is already a party Sec d A qui tam plaintiff may only be an original source with direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based A qui tam plaintiff may not obtain information from the news media or from public disclosure of the information in governmental or regulatory hearings investigations reports etc and use it to bring suit under the CFCA Sec d If the qui tam plaintiff is a state employee that person must exhaust various internal procedures before filing suit under the CFCA Sec d If the state a political subdivision or the qui tam plaintiff proceeds with the action the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses against the party that proceeded with the action if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim was clearly frivolous clearly vexatious or brought solely for purposes of harassment Sec g Other relevant provisions of the CFCA include The CFCA defines knowing and knowingly to mean that a person with respect to information A Has actual knowledge of the information B Acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information or C Acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information Importantly proof of specific intent to defraud is not required Sec b The CFCA has various damages limitations provisions for defendants who cooperate with the States investigation The CFCA has various whistleblower provisions protecting employees who disclose information about false claims In any action brought under Section the state the political subdivision or the qui tam plaintiff shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action including damages by a preponderance of the evidence Sec c This email message is for the sole use of the intended

PM To Michael L Kirby Email Cc Molland Michael E Smith Amanda D Subject Draft Research Memorandum on Senator Dunn Issues Mike Here is the draft research memo that Amanda prepared on some of the questions surrounding Senator Dunns investigation some of this you saw before Legislative Committee Subpoena Power Government Code Section provides that a subpoena requiring the attendance of any witness before the Senate Assembly or a committee may be issued by the President of the Senate Speaker of the Assembly or the chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the witness is desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee of the respective house There is a relative dearth of case law interpreting Govt Code et seq and the Govt Code reporters cross reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections on issuance of subpoenas CCP et seq Therefore it is possible that the provisions of both the Govt Code and the CCP will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena issued by a legislative committee Govt Code Section provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it a states whether the proceeding is before the Senate Assembly or a committee b is addressed to the witness presumably the custodian of records when documents are sought c requires the attendance of the witness at a time and place certain and d is signed by the President of the Senate Speaker of the Assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the witness is desired If the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or neglects or refuses to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books papers or document sin his possession or under his control he has committed a contempt Govt Code Section If the contempt is committed while the Legislature is in session Govt Code Section provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the Senate or Assembly for such action as may be deemed necessary by the Senate or Assembly If the Legislature is not in session the superior court in and for the county in which any inquiry investigation hearing or proceeding is held may compel the production of books papers documents and accounts as required by the subpoena issued by the committee on the filing by the committee of a petition to the court asking that the witness be so compelled Govt Code Section provides that any witness neglecting or refusing to attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested It is unclear how this provision would or whether it could be applied to a subpoena issued to the custodian of records of a nonresident company Motion to Quash Subpoena California courts have held under CCP Section that a motion to quash is the procedurally appropriate method of testing the validity of a subpoena duces tecum See eg People ex rel Dept of Public Works v Younger CalAppd My research has revealed no case in which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has been challenged by a motion to quash but as noted above there appear to be only a very few cases interpreting Govt Code et seq Therefore it appears that a superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a subpoena issued by a legislative committee assuming that we want to take the risk of state court jurisdiction In one early case the Court of Appeal held that the contempt order and accompanying affidavit issued by the Court upon the request of a Senate Committee were fatally defective Ex Parte McLain CalAppd In McLain the Senate Interim Committee on Social Welfare served upon Mr McLain the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of a corporation a subpoena calling for the production of various books papers and documents Mr McLain appeared before the committee but refused to answer questions or produce the documents Upon representation of the Committee the Superior Court issued an order directing Mr McLain to produce the documents Mr McLain again appeared before the Committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point an affidavit was filed in Superior Court stating That based upon evidence in its possession the said Senate Interim Committee has determined that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No and That each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and that the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No The Superior Court found Mr McLain guilty of contempt and ordered him committed to the sheriff until he produced the records The Court of Appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for In cases of constructive contempt as is this not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the offense McLain at This holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting CCP which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege material facts rather than conclusory statements See eg Grannis v Board of Medical Examiners CalAppd However cases interpreting CCP also require the subpoena to demonstrate a level of specificity materiality and relevance to be held proper See eg Pacific Auto Ins Co v Superior Court CalAppd It is unclear whether subpoenas issued by legislative committees are held to this same standard What is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued against the Enron custodian of records an outofstate resident intended to affect the production of outofstate Enron documents Here are the threshold questions A Since we have found so few cases interpreting Govt Code Section to what extent would a legislative committee subpoena be governed by the same procedural and substantive rules as a subpoena issued in a pending civil state court action B Would a court determining the validity of a legislative committee subpoena make reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections governing subpoenas generally ie CCP et seq or those governing deposition subpoenas ie CCP et seq This is a tossup and the answer may well be both The Government Code reporter sections on legislative subpoenas cross references to CCP et seq subpoenas generally However the deposition subpoena provisions CCP et seq more closely resemble the discovery process that the Senator seems to be undertaking Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq CCP is entitled Residency requirements for attendance of witnesses and provides that A witness including a witness specified in subdivision b of Section is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court judge justice or any other officer unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service There is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by Section Section provides when a subpoena duchess mecum is served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided in Article commencing with Section of Chapter of Division of the Evidence Code and his personal attendance is not required by the terms of the subpoena Section shall not apply Evade Code lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records where the business is neither a party nor the place where any cause of action is alleged to have arisen On commentator noted the following with respect to CCP The rule limiting subpoenas to California residents CCP does not apply to subpoenas duchess mecum served on custodians of records unless their personal attendance is required See CCP Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London CalAppth fn Thus a nonresident custodian of business records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon him or her while present in California by producing the records in accordance with Cal Evid Code delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court clerk However CCP probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to California jurisdiction Otherwise there would be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident See Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London supra Werner Fairbanks Epstein Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Trials at Moreover in one unpublished case Allee v King CalAppd the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to produce original outofstate documents at trial In so holding the court stated that even though King apparently voluntarily attended the trial his presence does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the outofstate documents Although section uses the word witness and does not refer to documents it has long been presumed under common law that documents in other states are outside the courts territorial jurisdiction so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence instead of originals See eg Heinz v Heinz CalAppd Pd and cases cited therein The recognition that outofstate documents are not subject to the courts process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that absent a statute properly conferring broader powers the extent of a states subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders See CJS Witnesses S p S p S p AmJurd Witnesses S p S p However the Allee court notes that the stateborder limitation on subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are outofstate Therefore even under Allee if a subpoena was issued to a California Enron entity that possessed responsive documents that Enron entity may be obligated to respond See Boal v Price Waterhouse Co CalAppd Therefore if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an outofstate officer of Enron Enron has a very good argument that that witness is not obligated to attend under CCP It also seems probable that under Amoco and Allele cited above if a subpoena is served on an Enron custodian of records who is employed by a nonCalifornia Enron entity the subpoena may be invalid However if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian of records or someone similarly situated who is employed by an Enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in California that Enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents It is an open question whether that custodian of records employed by an Enron entity in California would only be required to produce the Enron documents in the possession of the Enron California entity or whether that persons obligation would extend further to produce outof state documents ie documents from nonCalifornia Enron entities This question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the CCP statutory scheme see below but is still open Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq Additional threshold question If the legislative subpoena was treated as a deposition subpoena would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat Enron as a party or as a nonparty The rules governing the reach of discovery in California are obviously different for the two The deposition of a party or partyaffiliated witness may be noticed without a subpoena for a place within miles of the witness residence It is unclear how a court would resolve this issue After all if a court was resolving the issue at all an Enron entity will have appeared before it and would be a party However it seems moderately more likely that the court would treat Enrons obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was served with a nonparty subpoena There are three types of deposition subpoena a testimony only subpoena requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness a business records subpoena requires only the production of business records and a records and testimony subpoena requires both also formerly called subpoena duces tecum The second of these is the most relevant to Enron The attendance of an non party outofstate witness or the production of documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the deposition is to be taken CCP b Specifically CCP b provides If the deponent is not a party to the action or an officer director managing agent or employee of a party a party serving a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures required and available under the laws of the state territory or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to attend and to testify as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection copying and any related activity Some states issue subpoenas routinely some require a showing of materiality or relevancy and some require a commission from the court where the action is pending This question will depend on the law of the state when the custodian of records resides Regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an instate custodian of records would compel the production of outofstate documents Weil Brown Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Before Trial at notes It is unclear whether service of a business records subpoena on a nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records located outside the state CCP d requires that the subpoena be directed to the records custodian or someone authorized to certify the records Whether custodian requires actual custody of the records is unclear If it does serving an officer or agent in California would not compel production of business records located elsewhere The result is different where a records and testimony subpoena is used That procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party not merely in his or her custody If the State of California files civil suit against Enron to obtain discovery of the requested documents does the fact that the State is the plaintiff rather than a private party affect Enrons prospects for removal of the suit to federal court If the action filed by the State of California presents a federal question then under the rationale of the court in People of the State of California v Steelcase Inc CD Cal FSupp the case should be removable to federal court In People of the State of California v Steelcase Inc CD Cal FSupp the District Attorney of the County of Los Angeles brought suit alleging violations of the Cartwright Act and the Unfair Competition Statutes Cal Bus Prof Code and The District Court found that although the district attorney is only allowed to prosecute Cartwright Act violations on behalf of the county or public agencies located in the county the unfair competition statutes expressly provide that suit be brought in the name of the people of the State of California Id at Therefore for the purposes of the Unfair Competition Claims the Court found that the State of California was the real party in interest The Court then found that for diversity purposes a state is not a citizen of itself Therefore it cannot sue or be sued in a diversity action Id Specifically the Court found that even assuming arguendo that defendant is correct that the County of Los Angeles is the real party in interest and the proper party in the Cartwright Act claim diversity jurisdiction does not lie because under long established teaching there must be complete diversity ie all plaintiffs must be diverse from defendant Eg Strawbridge v Curtiss US Cranch LEd Here there cannot be complete diversity because to repeat the State of California is not a citizen of any state Id that independent of its failure to meet the complete diversity test the court lacks jurisdiction over this case because of the bar of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution The Eleventh Amendment is a grant of sovereign immunity to a state against suit in federal court It is in the nature of a jurisdictional bar Defendant relying on the literal wording of the Eleventh Amendment contends that this is not a suit against one of the United States because the State is the plaintiff However since the immunity granted by the Eleventh Amendment is an immunity from being made an involuntary party to an action in federal court it should apply equally to the case where the state is a plaintiff in an action commenced in state court and the action is removed to federal court by the defendant Id internal citations removed However the Court noted that where removal is predicated on federal question jurisdiction removal is permitted even where a nonremovable claim is joined with the removable claim Id If a criminal case price gouging etc is brought against Enron is there any theory preemption primary jurisdiction or double jeopardy which would allow that criminal proceeding to be dismissed stayed or removed given the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act Our preliminary research shows that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the Federal Power Act specifically Generally in one case concerning a District Court order staying criminal action involving allegations of conspiracy and fraud against a defense contractor pending the District Courts referral of various questions regarding the case to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals the Ninth Circuit has said Our concern with the district courts stay and referral is heightened by the fact that this action is a criminal prosecution While it is true that the primary jurisdiction doctrine has been applied in criminal cases see United States v Pacific A Ry Navigation Co US United States v Yellow Freight Sys th Cir Fd its use clearly interferes with the governments authority to prosecute criminal cases We said in a related context We approach the interpretation of the statute with a presumption against a congressional intention to limit the power of the Attorney General to prosecute offenses under the criminal laws of the United States In general the conduct of federal criminal litigation is an executive function within the exclusive prerogative of the Attorney General In re Subpoena of Persico Fd d Cir quoting United States v Cox Fd th Cir Wisdom J concurring Congress may limit or reassign the prosecutorial responsibility See Case v Bowles US SCt LEd Nader v Saxbe USAppDC Fd n DCCir FTC v Guignon Fd th Cir But to graft such an exception upon the criminal law would require a clear and unambiguous expression of the legislative will United States v Morgan US SCt LEd United States v International Union of Operating Engineers Local Fd th Cir cert denied US SCt LEdd United States v General Dynamics Corp th Cir Fd The General Dynamics Court went on to say that only where an issue unambiguously requires initial agency determination under the primary jurisdiction doctrine and the referring court has the authority to review the agencys order can the agencys regulatory interests be required or allowed to subordinate the governments authority to prosecute criminal offenses Id In another context the Ninth Circuit held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies before the Federal Election Commission was not a prerequisite to indictment under the Federal Election Campaign Act neither the language nor the legislative history of the Act provides the kind of clear and unambiguous expression of legislative will necessary to support a holding that Congress sought to alter the traditionally broad scope of the Attorney Generals prosecutorial discretion by requiring initial administrative screening of alleged violations of the Act On the contrary the language and legislative history indicates that while centralizing and strengthening the authority of the FERC to enforce the Act administratively and by civil proceedings Congress intended to leave undisturbed the Justice Departments authority to prosecute criminally a narrow range of aggravated offenses United States v International Union of Operating Engineers Local Fd See also In re Grand Jury Investigation of Shipping Industry DDC FSupp though the doctrine of primary jurisdiction may be applied to both civil and to criminal actions it is more forceful in the civil regulatory type actions than in criminal actions for in the latter actions the violations of other federal statutes may more often be involved and the regulatory scheme less affected Therefore it seems clear that it will be difficult to invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to dismiss or stay criminal proceedings against Enron especially since the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act are relatively limited In addition at least one court has held in the civil context that the Federal Power Act was not designed to shift the forum for the trial of antitrust questions affecting power companies from the District Courts to the Power Commission FERCs predecessor Pennsylvania Water Power Co v Consolidated Gas Electric Light Power Co th Cir Fd I have not been able to find any case directly on point which invokes double jeopardy type arguments In other words if there are possible criminal penalties under the Federal Power Act and the same conduct is at issue that was examined by FERC would State law criminal charges based upon the same conduct be precluded Further research on this point after the filing of a criminal claim when the details of the allegations are known may be productive Also it may be worthwhile to look for regulatory statutes that consider language similar to that in the Federal Power Act to determine if preemptionprimary jurisdiction case law exists in

May PM To Fergus Gary S Subject FW Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High Original Message From Fergus Gary S Sent Monday October AM To Meringolo Peter Subject FW Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High FYI Thanks Gary Original Message From Fergus Gary S Sent Friday October PM To Cc MBD Subject Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis We believe that the production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges Generally speaking the Enron Entities propose to produce documents for year as noted below We also understand that the Commission will be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production Enron Energy Services Operations Inc is the parent of Enron Energy Services Inc and does not have operating authority or engage in wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy Thus the documents offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy Services Inc but we have designated them both as EES We also do not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests through Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities businesses the burden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April is significant The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of their current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization To the extent that the Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods they will also make those available One Enron Entity Portland General has published books on its corporate history If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it With respect to the other Enron Entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October Requests and The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers We believe this information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the staffs purposes FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI EES and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data the Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which information includes economic data We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests and For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions For Portland General the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as Portland General owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand As a result we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited Nevertheless Portland General proposes to provide for year electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant as discussed below We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the California market At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests and We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant transaction data for year in California and outside of California and Real Time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or a sale Because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMIs customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES confidentiality obligations to those customers We anticipate producing the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order In addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission If you have any questions or comments about our proposal please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day or myself Brobeck Phleger Harrison LLP Gary Fergus

case against Enron to federal court It is not as promising as we first thought Thanks Gary Original Message From Smith Amanda D Sent Thursday May PM To Fergus Gary S Cc Molland Michael E Meringolo Peter Subject Enron Response to Criminal Charges Gary Our earlier preliminary research reflected the fact that although it will likely be difficult it may be possible under the primary jurisdiction doctrine to refer criminal charges to FERC given the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act However as it becomes more clear that if criminal charges are to be filed they will be filed in California it is necessary to revisit and expand this earlier research We noted earlier that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the Federal Power Act specifically Based on this we concluded that it may be possible if difficult to argue that criminal charges should be referred to FERC under the primary jurisdiction doctrine An expansion of this research reveals that this potential for referral appears to only be applicable to federal criminal charges State criminal charges are not removable under USC Section which provides that except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction may be removed by the defendant or the defendants to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending Moreover our research has revealed no case in which state criminal charges were referred directly to any federal regulatory agency However our research has revealed another alternative to removal or referral of criminal charges See generally Sprint Corp v Evans MD Al FSupp Sprint Corp v Evans MD Al FSupp In the Attorney General of Alabama began an investigation of Sprint Corporation an international telecommunications company acting as a common carrier within the meaning of the federal Communications Act Sprint among other things provided a service to subscribers pursuant to tariffs filed with the FCC To use these numbers a caller places a call through a local telephone company who connects the call to a long distance carrier such as Sprint who generally then connected the call to the subscribers local telephone number In February Sprint received a subpoena from the Montgomery County Grand Jury commanding it to appear and produce all records relating to the service Sprint produced the documents and learned that it was under investigation for violation of Alabamas obscenity laws in connection with allegedly obscene content distributed over telephone lines In March Sprint filed a motion for a temporary restraining order TRO and a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Alabama Attorney General from pursuing a criminal indictment against Sprint for violation of the obscenity law Sprint maintained enforcement of the antiobscenity law would interfere with federal statutory rights because regulation of interstate communications is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the FCC At the TRO hearing the Attorney General could not testify that the prosecution was not imminent and therefore the court issued the TRO Later in March the Court decided Sprints motion for a preliminary injunction Sprint Corp v Evans MD Al FSupp At the hearing on this motion counsel for the Attorney General stated that the Attorney Generals position regarding Sprints criminal liability under the obscenity statute related to the its obligations under that law when a telephone customer complains that a subscribers message is offensive According to counsel if a customer complains Sprint is obligated to either report the complaint to a prosecuting attorney or begin a declaratory judgment action against the subscriber The District Court granted the preliminary injunction The court held that under the relevant Eleventh Circuit test for determining whether a preliminary injunction should issue the movant must show a substantial likelihood that she will ultimately prevail on the merits that she will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party and that if issued the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest Sprint FSupp at Before the Court considered the first element of this test the Court addressed the contention that the District Court had no jurisdiction The Court held that the Supreme Court however has held that federal courts have federalquestion jurisdiction under USCA S to entertain suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal statutory rights The Court then held that there was a substantial likelihood that Sprint would prevail on the merits because to the extent that the Alabama antiobscenity statute attempts to impose reporting requirements on communications by common carriers it is interstate in nature and preempted by federal law The statute is being used as a mechanism to impose new reporting requirements on common carriers with regard to their service Currently under federal law common carriers do not have an affirmative obligation to investigate whether their facilities are being used by customers for a lawful purpose Importantly the Court did not reach the question whether the Communications Act preempts all Alabama laws imposing liability for conduct of common carriers in the area of obscenity The Court also rejected the Attorney Generals argument that a Younger abstention was necessary The Court disposed of the last three parts of the preliminary injunction test easily First the Court held that irreparable harm would result because an indictment against Sprint would cause great harm to its business reputation and would jeopardize its status as a government contractor Second the Court held that the potential harm to Sprint outweighed the potential harm to the Attorney General because although the Attorney General relies on a state statute directed at the prosecution of the distribution of obscene matter the Attorney General really seeks to impose interstate reporting requirements on common carriersin other words the generic proceeding at issue is the regulation of interstate telecommunications by common carriers outside the context of the distribution of obscene matter The Attorney General clearly has no interest in such interstate regulation Third the Court held that the preliminary injunction serves the public interest by ensuring that the national interest in fulfilling the goals of the Federal Communications Act Sprint FSupp at In a separate decision almost a year later the District Court granted in part Sprints motion to refer certain issues to the FCC under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction Sprint FSupp at Prior to this motion the Alabama Attorney General changed its allegations regarding the illegality of Sprints conduct under the obscenity law now alleging that Sprint was not criminally liable because of a failure to report but because of a aiding and abetting theory The District Court held in brief that referral to FCC under primary jurisdiction doctrine was warranted with regard to question of whether common carriers consistent with Communications Act may refuse to carry information providers program transmitted as service if program contains sexually explicit information that has not been adjudicated obscene and referral to FCC was not warranted with respect to question of whether attempted criminal prosecution of interstate common carrier under states antiobscenity laws for knowingly transmitting potentially obscene or obscene telephone communications through its interstate facilities is preempted by Communications Act Sprint FSupp at The Court then ordered that the record of the case be transmitted to the FCC that the preliminary injunction remain in effect and that all motions would be denied without prejudice until after the FCC rendered its decision Obviously no analysis of the criminal charges against Enron can yet be made but there is a significant chance that Enron may be able to cast any criminal charges filed by the California Attorney General as regulatory in nature Moreover given relative lack of effect the Alabama Attorney Generals change in position in the middle of the Sprint case the regulatory aspect of the charges may not be as important as it may seem in the first Sprint holding on the preliminary injunction Please let me know if you would like me to pursue this further My research has not yet revealed any case that is factually similar to the Sprint case This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain

Defendants Contact Sheet Dave Noonan Mike Kirby Mike Day and I will try to figure out who is representing whom in San Diego Removal Diversity Mike Kirby pointed out that even if we solved the citizenship issue it is unlikely that every class member will meet the amount in controversy requirement We also have the preliminary reports that Sempra Energy Resources is a California corporation that is selling electrical energy into the California PX market See December status report I need to followup and find out if Sempra Energy Resources has outside counsel yet and confirm their understanding on this issue Federal Question and Related Primary Jurisdiction Argument All of us need to understand the interrelationship between the FERCPUCISO investigations and this class action There is also the pending challenge to the ISO MMIPs by Enron and others that has been pending for some time Does the complaint fairly raise or necessarily implicate a federal question Change of Venue Additional Research by Peter Meringolo I have researched case law involving class actions where class members are jurors I found only two nonCalifornia cases and both involve change of venue motions See Beech v Leaf River Forest Prods So d Miss Toledo Fair Hous Ctr v Nationwide Mut Ins Co NEd Ohio Ct Com Pl These cases however do not change the analysis required under CCP o b In Beech plaintiffs brought a nonclass action lawsuit against defendants for polluting two rivers with dioxin Defendants moved for a change of venue In addition to evidence of negative publicity defendants showed that of the potential jurors were plaintiffs in other dioxin cases against these defendants and even more were potential class members in a class action brought against these same defendants in another county Beech So d at The trial court granted defendants motion because the negative publicity and the large number of jurors involved in similar litigation would prevent the defendants from receiving a fair trial Id The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion Id Toledo Fair involved a class action against Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company Nationwide moved for a change of venue arguing among other things that because of the large size of the class a significant percentage of veniremen would be either class members or relatives of class members and would thus be ineligible to sit as jurors Toledo Fair NEd at Plaintiffs argued that Nationwide exaggerated the size of the class Id The court denied the motion holding that because of the dispute regarding the size of the class it was too early to determine whether an impartial jury could be impaneled The court clearly left open the possibility for Nationwide to renew this motion We also discussed the remote possibility of challenging the judge who would hear this case under Section for cause because the Judge would be part of the class Dave Noonan has had experience in the egg case with this type of challenge Consolidation Dave and Mike will look at how to manage a consolidation with Judge Amos under San Diego local rules if that is what we decided to do Keeping in mind that the claims are not jury claims the selection of the judge is critical Coordination with Defense Counsel Dave and Mike will be responsible with Robin for coordinating among defense counsel in San Diego

Marketing Corporation EEMC Enron Energy Services Operations Inc EESO and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents these entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having acquired sold divested joint ventured spun off and otherwise reorganized themselves extensively during the past two years The burden and expense on Enron to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in its organization since April is significant The Enron entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization To the extent that Enron can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods it will also make those available One Enron Entity Portland General has published books on its corporate history If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it With respect to the other entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October Requests and The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Data will identify its customers and suppliers FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities will produce its public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI ESSI and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October and the transaction data in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests and For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are very small and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and information for Enron Wind Saguaro and Las Vegas Cogeneration We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions For Portland General there will be a very large volume of documents and we propose to handle them differently First Portland General will provide for year electronic data in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant With respect to specific generating cost data because of the volume we suggest that these documents be made available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of facilities If there are specific documents that the Commission would like copied from that production we can discuss the arrangements for producing these documents We propose to make these documents available in Portland in a third wave of document productions TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Request We understand that the CPUC will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of trading data for year in California and outside of California and Real Time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is purchase or sale Because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMIs customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EESI can also provide similar electronic data with the proviso that it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number Many of ESSIs customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to object ESSI cannot meet your time frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require We anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron

California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Inc EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC Enron Energy Services Operations Inc EESO and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis We believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION Generally speaking the documents and information that the Commission seeks can be found if they exist within EPMI EES and Portland General To the extent that EEMC or EESO are relevant to the Commissions investigation any documents would be located within EES Thus we do not anticipate specific document productions from either EEMC or EESO GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having acquired sold divested joint ventured spun off and otherwise reorganized themselves extensively during the past two years The burden and expense on Enron to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in its organization since April is significant The Enron entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family

Entities propose that their responses to Requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI EES and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data It is intended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial information regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its investigation We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests and For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and information for Enron Wind Saguaro and Las Vegas Cogeneration We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions For Portland General the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as Portland General owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand As a result we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited In addition those transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are limited to sales to the ISO and PX and long term contracts with two small California municipal utilities Thus the Commission will receive the essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and PX Nevertheless Portland General proposes to provide for year electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the California market At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market Alternate ending to paragraph We propose for the voluminous Portland General generating cost and maintenance data that these documents be made available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of facilities If there are specific documents that the Commission would like copied from that production we can discuss the arrangements for producing these documents We propose to make these documents available in Portland in a third wave of document productions TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests and We understand that the Commission will be obtaining

speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMIs customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EES is a retail provider of electricity and plays a far more limited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the Commission investigation However EES can also provide similar electronic Transaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number This additional restriction is important to EES because many of EESs customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to object EES cannot meet your time frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of retail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the wholesale market we do not believe protecting the identity of retail customers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request We anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities

Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order In addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order We

year as noted below We also understand that the Commission will be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production Enron Energy Services Operations Inc is the parent of Enron Energy Services Inc and does not have operating authority or engage in wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy Thus the documents offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy Services Inc but we have designated them both as EES We also do not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests through Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities businesses the burden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April is significant The Enron Entities will provide the

order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order In addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission If you have any questions or

Gary Original Message From Fergus Gary S Sent Friday October PM To Cc MBD Subject Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis We believe that the production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges Generally speaking the Enron Entities propose to produce documents for year as noted below We also understand that the Commission will be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production Enron Energy Services Operations Inc is the parent of Enron Energy Services Inc and does not have operating authority or engage in wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy Thus the documents offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy Services Inc but we have designated them both as EES We also do not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests through Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities businesses the burden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April is significant The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of their current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization To the extent that the Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods they will also make those available One Enron Entity Portland General has published books on its corporate history If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it With respect to the other Enron Entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October Requests and The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers We believe this information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the staffs purposes FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI EES and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data the Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which information includes economic data We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests and For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions For Portland General the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as Portland General owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand As a result we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited Nevertheless Portland General proposes to provide for year electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant as discussed below We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the California market At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests and We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant transaction data for year in California and outside of California and Real Time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or a sale Because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMIs customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES confidentiality obligations to those customers We anticipate producing the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains

Enron Entities profits or losses in the purchase and sale of electricity in the WSCC You also stated that we would receive the electronic data base for on Oct and that you will check with your clients as to how soon you can get us the data for the transactions from June through December This will further confirm that your response to the subpoenas on behalf of the Enron Entities includes Enron

<11993005.1075853188581.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,gfergus@brobeck.com,2000-10-20 07:44:00,Data Cc AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE Richard I am following up on the electronic data from Tim Do we have any more progress yet I also met with Mike Day yesterday to discuss his views on strategy for opposing the subpoena if it becomes necessary He added an important fact He said that because the CPUC is a California constitutionally created entity they take the view that they need not go to Superior Court for enforcement of their orders While Williams and others are claiming that they should Michael believes it much much more likely that the procedural course will be for the ALJ to enter a decision and order which the full Commission may but need not consider If the Commission does not take up the ALJs order at that point we would be left with seeking a writ of mandate at the Court of Appeals level In other words if the CPUC takes that view then there may be no de novo review anywhere outside of the CPUC This is because orders of the CPUC are only reviewable at the Court of Appeals level Thus there may be no need for the Commission to even bother trying to find a favorable judge in San Diego since the commission already has the contempt power In short this wrinkle seems to make the ALJ approach even less appealing than before Williams however is still pressing apparently on the theory that the CPUC should go to Superior Court Michael also had a suggestion for a back channel approach to the AG that was raised on the governmental affairs side of the house that might be useful to discuss next week Thanks Gary This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and privileged information Any unauthorized review use disclosure or distribution is prohibited If you are not the intended recipient please contact the sender by reply email and destroy all copies of the original message To reply to our email administrator directly send an email to BROBECK PHLEGER HARRISON LLP 
<3417863.1075853189129.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,gfergus@brobeck.com,2000-10-24 07:45:00,Some thoughts on options Cc AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE Richard After todays discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on options WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others If the protective order has not changed then unilaterally postpone production until it is Pro Better protection and more time Con Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled to financial performance data Thus this option does not fully disclose all of Enrons positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics Under this option we file our formal objections as well TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered Pro PUC will get the data anyway either through FERC unfair competition antitrust or price gouging litigation By turning over the data that will show profits PUC might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose witnesses etc Con This would be waiving the legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUCs ability to discovery this information through a subpoena There is also a question of how confidential this data would be given the current political agenda It might also serve to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron information and discovery This option would also provide confidential proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive advantage TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF DATA FROM ISO AND PX We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give only missing data PRO It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of California data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question Con Without Enron cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want a profit and loss picture We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that the combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need to calculate the answers to Request Nos TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data Pro It would not reveal the profit and loss information Con It would not reveal the profit and loss information In other words the PUC is clear that this is what they are after By giving them everything else we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and loss Moreover by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX data the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be quite large but just not the cost or expense side DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position for the following reasons Our firm belief that the PUC is not entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking in his latest email Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more data than we discussed earlier continued threat that if they do not like the transaction data they will come back and ask for profit and loss information that we do not believe they are entitled to Commissioner Woods statement that the purpose of this investigation is to get money from market participants in the hands of consumers investigation by the AG into activities of other market participants and the notice that other governmental agencies are cooperating who are we producing this information to and for what purpose Enron favors public disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to do so Enron is a small player in this market and many other market participants are not involved in the process BPA etc PRO This may be the only way to preserve Enrons challenge to the jurisdiction of the PUC to get this data Moreover in the current political environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked It also makes sense to see what FERC will do with their published report on investigation date Under this option we file our formal objections and sit back and wait ME TOO Upon reflection we agree with the approach taken by the other market participants We will not produce until the protective order is modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction PRO This makes it look like all the market participants are acting in concert and really is no different than option above Moreover if you read Reliants responses they appear ready to turn over financial data if the protective order is modified Terry and Mike Day are both out of their offices today Note that Williams is adopting a strategy that says the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena This may be met with strong opposition by the PUC given their California constitutional contempt authority MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits before the ALJ PRO The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions It has the least procedural risks of being dismissed CON Reading the tea leaves we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the PUC has no jurisdiction Moreover because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted contempt power the PUC will take the view according to Mike Day that they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement They will also take the view that the Superior Court has no jurisdiction to hear our appeal Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at the Court of Appeal level Thus the only de novo review of our objections might be at the ALJ level FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act and in particular the provisions of g under which the PUC issued its subpoena in part The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and loss information from the wholesale market The authority for this would be Mississippi Power Light v Mississippi US bright line between wholesale market regulated by FERC and the retail market regulated by states Bristol Energy Corp v New Hampshire Fd st Cir federal question whether state agency can inquire into business and financial data in the wholesale market but found no cognizable claim PRO The federal forum may be more even handed than the ALJ but the question is whether we can state a cognizable claim There may be greater protections from disclosure of the information as well CON The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless we are able to obtain injunctive relief The PUC might seek discovery of the same information in the Federal court proceeding We should assume that this action will trigger the strongest response from the PUC andor the AG in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same information eg unfair business practice suit price gouging antitrust etc We should anticipate deposition requests for traders etc By taking this position we will clearly be conceding that if FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority SEPARATE RESPONSESSTRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland General EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from those entities PRO The information provided for these entities is not likely to generate profit and loss information that would be germane to the fight we are about to engage in eg EESs description of off tariff rates for example For Portland General Dave Aamodt is out of the office and not able to participate in any change of direction discussions Hope this is

<4187001.1075853231725.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,gfergus@brobeck.com,2000-11-28 01:11:00,Revised Draft Response to PUC Cc AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and phone calls between Michael Day on behalf of the Enron Entities and yourself during the past few weeks Here is the current status as we understand it Based upon the agreements we reached between October and October date of your confirming email the Enron Entities have made the following document productions in response to the subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission the Commission October Bate Nos Enron Entities on behalf of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos October Bate Nos P on behalf of Portland General Responsive to Request Nos and November Bate No Enron Entities Diskette with EESEEMC retail data Responsive to Request Nos to to and November Bate No P Diskettes with Portland General Data which include approximate wholesale transactions Responsive to Request Nos to to and We believe with these productions we have complied with the October th agreement with respect to Portland General and EESEEMC As you know these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for EPMI as defined in our October th email available for production by October th However we were also mindful of your expressed expectation that any data provided be useful and reliable The collection of data you requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same location nor organized as you requested it In fact during our review of some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved we informed you of the problem We now understand that if we cannot give you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be available the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission FERC We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data immediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in the immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce accurate data Moreover during the interim between October th and today a number of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas served on the Enron entities First we understand that many other parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very sound legal grounds Second the Commission itself has without a hearing on the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes sought by other parties served Third the Commission has filed its motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited hearing and production schedule We note that the reasons stated in the motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to the Commissions own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas FERC has also issued its tentative order as of November covering some of the same topics as the Commissions subpoena request Finally FERC has requested information in specific areas from a number of entities including Enron Enron is simultaneously working on preparing responses to FERCs requests Originally the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept most favored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requests by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that was available However given both the Commissions stated urgent need for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite substantial effort date for production of reliable and accurate Transaction Data and the uncertainty created by the above described intervening events EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commissions threatened motion to compel before FERC We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been served with subpoenas We understand that there is a list for those entities that have been cooperating a list for those who have been delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their rights to challenge the subpoenas We understand that the Commission intends to punish by whatever means it has available those entities that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas We deplore these tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described above we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights If you have and questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me Sincerely Gary S Fergus This email message is for the

been filed even though the November draft order is not yet final Cal PX said they could not implement the software necessary to run the soft caps by January st The City San Diego requested rehearing on the issue of whether FERC has the authority to order refunds The City of San Diegos Friday filing said the SDGE had M in its balancing account that it would be seeking from ratepayers The City argued that because their were not just and reasonable rates the filed rate doctrine is not called into question Charles Dick I spoke with Charles Dick about his personal availability He told me that he understood we were asking for a personal commitment from him He has one matter that is set for arbitration in June that will take a significant amount of this time He has other matters but is willing to personally commit the time necessary for this engagement He had the same approach as in the interview not selling himself but being completely responsive David Noonan David called to tell me he had left messages for Richard but they had not connected yet In part it was because David was in deposition We discussed conflict issues at some length In the copper cases where he represents SCE they have a and share of the damages at issue Thus he is not acting as longstanding SCE counsel He said that he did not believe that he could get a written forward looking waiver since the general counsel does not see this representation as a current conflict He agreed however that he would be able to confirm that in the event that Enron and SCE become adverse while he would not be able to represent either entity in that litigation if he is still representing them in the copper litigation SCE would not claim that his continued representation of Enron in the nonadverse matters was a violation of the duty of loyalty David was going to continue to try and connect with Richard Larry Ruff Larry has reviewed the preliminary data that we were proposing to release to the PUC In particular I asked him to take the view of a regulator and use the data to show market power withholding electricity etc He told me that the data was not all that helpful in any of those regards First he found the same anomalies later in the year with respect to energy purchased and energy sold He also had some questions about the identity of various counterparties used in the system He found that the data did not include price by the hour instead only the hour aggregate To the extent that we want to understand what happened during peak periods we would need the detailed data We also discussed finding out what sources of public market data were available to understand what was happening in the market to compare the Enron data with Larry has completed the initial quick look that we asked for He will be in Australia for the next few months We have made arrangements for encrypted email etc to be available so that we may consult with him as needed Tariffs and FERC related Materials Jean asked for the reference to the legal requirement to submit a balanced schedule etc Peter Meringolo from our office gathered this material earlier and we include it below We also enclose Ron Carols brief that he sent us that challenges the penalty provisions of the ISO tariff That litigation has been ongoing for a number of years The requirement for EPMI to submit a balanced schedule is found in the ISO tariff at section A Scheduling Coordinator shall submit to the ISO only Balanced Schedules in the DayAhead Market and the HourAhead Market A Schedule shall be treated as a Balanced Schedule when aggregate Generation InterScheduling Coordinator Energy Trades whether purchases or sales and imports or exports to or from external Control Areas adjusted for Transmission Losses as appropriate equals aggregate forecast Demand with respect to all entities for which the Scheduling Coordinator schedules in each zone If a Scheduling Coordinator submits a Schedule that is not a Balanced Schedule the ISO shall reject that Schedule provided that Scheduling Coordinators shall have an opportunity to validate their schedules prior to the deadline for submission to the ISO by requesting such validation prior to the applicable deadline The ISO Market Monitoring Information Protocol MMIP sets forth the standards for Anomalous Market Behavior See MMIP Anomalous market behavior which is defined as behavior that departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or unexplained market outcomes Evidence of such behavior may be derived from a number of circumstances including withholding Generation capacity under circumstances in which it would normally be offered in a competitive market unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by Generators unusual trades or transactions pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions eg prices and bids that appear consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions and unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports form or exports to other markets and exchanges The MMIP also prohibits Gaming See MMIP Gaming or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs Protocols or Activity Rules or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion to the detriment of the efficiency of and of consumers in the ISO Markets Gaming may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity such as loop flow facility outages level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy imports from outofstate or actions or behaviors that may otherwise render the system and the ISO Markets vulnerable to price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency The ISO MMIP allows the ISO to do any of the following among other things as a result of an entitys Anomalous Market Behavior or Gaming impose such sanctions or penalties as it believes necessary and as are permitted under the ISO Tariff See MMIP refer to such regulatory or antitrust agency as it sees fit to recommend the imposition of sanctions and penalties See MMIP publicize in whatever medium it believes most appropriate the activities or behavior of Market Participants in the ISO Markets revealed to have the effect of or potential for undermining the efficiency workability or reliability of the ISO Markets to give or to serve such Market Participants an unfair competitive advantage over other Market Participants See MMIP Ron Carrolls FERC Brief on MMIPs FERCbriefdoc Projects Under Way Collection of Basic Business

Investigation in Canada FYI dowjonesPDF EPMI Western Trading Desk Organization Chart Organizational chartPDF Change of Venue Research by Peter Meringolo Heres preliminary analysis of change of venue The court may change the venue of a trial where there is reason to believe that an impartial trial cannot be had therein CCP o b The party requesting a change of venue must show actual widespread prejudice extending over a long period of time Nguyen v Superior Court Cal App th Whether such a showing has been made is left to the discretion of the trial court Id Case law provides little guidance regarding how much evidence is enough for a party to show actual prejudice As Witkin states this challenge is so vague and difficult to sustain Witkin Cal Procedure Actions o th ed In fact a change of venue on these grounds has been granted in very few reported cases the most recent of which was in See People v Ocean Shore RR Cal App d San Joaquin and Kings River Canal and Irrigation Co v Stevinson Cal Ocean Shore was an eminent domain proceeding against defendant land owners to acquire lands to build a state highway one defendants motion for change of venue was granted People v Ocean Shore RR Cal App d The defendant filed nearly affidavits which referenced newspaper articles reports from civic meetings and statements by citizens showing a widespread prejudice against the defendants and its cause extending over a long period of years Id at The Court affirmed the trial courts discretion noting that the affidavits show that it would at least make it extremely doubtful whether an impartial trial could be had before a jury in that county Id at San Joaquin was a condemnation action for the use of waters of a river for the benefit of landowners on the west side of the river San Joaquin and Kings River Canal and Irrigation Co v Stevinson Cal In that action the defendant operated an irrigation system for the benefit of the landowners on the east side of the river Plaintiff filed one affidavit showing that the people on the east side of the river felt widespread prejudice against plaintiff and people on the west side of the river were disqualified as jurors because they were using defendants irrigation system Id at Defendant filed affidavits in opposition According to the Court if numbers of affiants or of affidavits were the determining factor in questions of this character the defendant herein would have been entitled to prevail upon said motion but this is not the rule Id at Rather the question is whether the trial court abused its discretion and the Court held that it did not These cases are contrasted with two case reported since in which change of venue motions were denied See Riverside County Flood Control and Water Conservation Dist v Joseph W Wolfskill Co Cal App d Nguyen v Superior Court Cal App th Riverside County was an eminent domain proceeding where plaintiff was seeking to condemn property for the purposes of flood control Defendants moved for a change of venue by presenting evidence that the advantages of the flood control project was widely publicized the newspapers portrayed defendants as trying to prevent flood controls that the cost of purchasing defendants property was to come from county funds and therefore every taxpayer was adverse to defendant Cal App d at Plaintiffs affidavit contradicted these facts The trial court denied the motion and this decision was affirmed on appeal Id at In Nguyen the State brought a suit against business owners in order to shut down a red light district in San Mateo The defendant businesses moved for a change of venue Defendants evidence consisted of two newspaper articles reporting the raid on the businesses that the city spent over investigating and one affidavit of an employee of defendants lawyer The trial court denied the motion because the evidence fell far short of proving actual prejudice Cal App th at Moreover the trial was to be a court trial not a jury trial and defendants showed no prejudice by the court Id Ross v Kalin Cal App although an extreme case exemplifies that a change of venue motion most likely requires a high standard of proof In Ross plaintiffs motion for change of venue was denied Plaintiff filed numerous affidavits in which uncontroverted facts showed that as a result of plaintiffs crusade against vice conditions in the City of venue plaintiff was assaulted by a mob beaten tarred and feathered and chained to a tree Id at The local newspaper published editorials approving the mob action Id Plaintiffs attorney was also assaulted and beaten and banned from two organizations Id Of the to potential jurors between and were prejudiced against the plaintiff at some point in time Id at The appellate court affirmed holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that this prejudice against the plaintiffs did not outweigh the defendants right to have their case tried in the county where they reside and their witnesses reside Id

Portland meeting was to find out whether or not there was a private right of action or prohibition of same under the Federal Power Act Here is Ron Carrolls response The courts have refused to create a private cause of action for violations of the FPA stating that the regulatory scheme created by Congress vested the regulatory body with the power to pursue enforcement See Clark v Gulf Oil Corp Fd pertaining to the recovery of losses due to allegedly unlawful rates under the NGA City of Gainesville v Florida Power Light Co F Supp SD Fla noting that the legislative history of the NGA which was modeled after the FPA does not suggest the existence of any private rights of action Dave Noonans Report on Defense Counsel Teleconference on Monday Chris Healy has just advised me that the call will

KirklandEllis LA Data Preservation Steve Hall and others have been working on making sure that the California AGs request to preserve evidence has been complied with EPMI will probably be extending the period that it keeps backup tapes making copies of hard drives from individual computers etc FERC Developments Secretary of Energy Richardson issued an emergency order requiring EPMI to market energy to the ISO In addition another emergency order was issued today I enclose the order and the press release The Press release for todays order is included below The FERC special meeting on California was videotaped by Nancy Pickover of Bracewell and is being sent to us corderpdf Califnoticepdf deccaorderpdf Dan Watkiss Analysis of FERC Order re Penalties for Refusal to sell Energy Last Friday the ISO filed with FERC Amendment No to its tariff Among other things the Amendment adds to the section of the tariff new provisions empowering the ISO to assess a penalty against Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency The penalty is stiff a charge for each MWh of the Dispatch instruction with which the Participating Generator does not comply equal to twice the highest price for Energy per MWh paid in each hour by the ISO to any other entity to produce Energy and if the ISO is required t call for the involuntary curtailment of firm Load to maintain Applicable Reliability Criteria during the System Emergency then an additional charge equal to for each MWh of the Dispatch instruction with which the Participating Generator does not comply The only defense to these penalties is to provide proof that the generating unit in question was physically incapable of running or it would have violated state or federal law to run it eg air emission allowance limits The ISO asked FERC for an immediate effective date of December which FERC granted in a December order The ISO Tariff defines Participating Seller or Generator to mean A generator or other seller of Energy or Ancillary Services through a Scheduling Coordinator over the ISO Controlled Grid and which has undertaken to be bound by the terms of the ISO Tariff If Enron is a Participating Generator Mary Hain informs me that Enron is not one then it risks incurring the new penalty if it fails to respond to an ISO order to sell ancillary services to the ISO I believe Enron might also risk incurring the penalty in cases where it controls or has rights to all or a portion of a generating capacity of a Participating Generators unit If that capacity is called on and the call is not answered because Enron is making some other use of the capacity the Enron may incur the penalty This seems to be contemplated by section of the Participating Generator Agreement which obliges a Participating Generator to comply with the tariff section by identifying the Generating Units that it owns operates or has a contractual entitlement to in Schedule as required by Section of the ISO Tariff emphasis added As far as I know it is that Schedule that the ISO consults when making decisions as to which Participating Generator to call on Thanks Gary This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and privileged

market RojoincmpltPDF California AG Investigation Here is a copy of my email to the California AG describing our agreement re preservation of data Rich As promised here is my summary outline of what we discussed regarding preservation of data In Portland we proposed to handle business email related to the topics in your preservation letter by instructing employees not to delete any email sent or received for hours Email that is personal and does not relate to the business topics you have identified can be kept discarded etc at the employees pleasure Each day there is a backup made that will capture the email in those employees mailboxes After hours each employee is free to manage their email box as they deem appropriate to the business needs eg keep discard From our conversation I understand that you agree that this is an acceptable procedure With respect to the hard drives on individual computers you would like to get an organizational chart for Portland that would enable us to discuss individuals computers that would be copied using ProQuest Drive Image Pro In addition there may be some other individuals that you would like to have us use a software product called Robocopy to copy files from their hard drives onto the network Until we figure out which computers to copy etc we will not begin this process We discussed that because of the holiday period it may not be practical to get this started until after the new year Outside of Portland we have proposed making a snapshot backup along business function lines reasonably called for by the subject matter of your request We propose not to backup any other business units or functions On a going forward basis those business functions that related to the subject matter of your request would be instructed not to delete business email We believe that relevant database backups have been and will continue to be made and preserved When an employee runs out of hard disk space on their computer it is an acceptable practice to copy files form their hard disk to the network where they will be backed up and then delete those copied files to make sufficient work space for the employee to work For EES I explained that their IT services are outsourced so we do not have as detailed information immediately available As I mentioned on the phone all of these discussions and efforts being made are done without waiving any objections that any of the Enron entities may have to your request including scope burden jurisdiction relevance privilege privacy vagueness etc and Enron specifically reserves each and every right and objection it or its employees may have Please let me know if your general understanding of our conversation is different than the above CPUC Subpoena Jeff Richter and Tim Belden have been working on getting the EPMI data correctly gathered They hope that by the middle of next week the Enron technical types will have figured out where all the data is and have assembled it for production Because Jeff Richter will be gone until after the New Year we will not be producing any data to the CPUC until early next year Jeff and Tim are focused on having a common set of reliable data that will be used for all subpoenas discovery requests etc We also discussed once we have the data collected that we use one of our experts to help with the analysis so that we are not creating files and records for which we will need to claim a privilege at a later point in time In other words since we are keeping the backup tapes for the systems in Portland any analytical work that Tim or Jeff do for us will be recorded on the backup tapes Tim Belden FYI Tim and his wife are expecting their first child with a due date of December th He will become out of pocket for a short time thereafter FERC Reporting A question arose regarding whether Enron needed to file a report to FERC concerning sales out of market that exceeded the soft caps This was a requirement that was requested by the ISO in an emergency application on December th The order granting the relief did not seem to include the reporting requirement The first cut at the data for the report showed that Enron made M over a weekend by buying power at and selling at A later cut at the data came up with a different answer When consulted by Christian Yoder and Steve Hall I made the unilateral decision not to file the report It was unclear whether we needed to do so and I had not seen and did not trust the data Later Dan Watkiss confirmed that he believed we did not need to file the report However beginning January th this report will have to be filed for sales over the soft cap Since this report requires a breakdown of costs vs sales price it is the same data that the PUC has been requesting and we anticipate will be requested in the litigation Tim Belden and Jeff Richter are working on a standard reporting method Hiring of Chief Operating Officer for ISO Tim Belden has been approached by the current Chief Operating officer of the ISO requesting a job Apparently the COO and the current ISO board are not getting along The issue raised by Tim to Mark Haedicke and Richard was whether they saw a problem with this hire One of the key issues would be what was the business purpose for the hire Obviously Enron does not want confidential ISO information from this person Also if this person will be a witness in the litigation there is a risk that if his testimony would be favorable to Enron it would be viewed as purchased On the other hand if his testimony would not be favorable at a time when he was employed by Enron that could be harmful There is also the question raised whether this is a bona fide request for employment or whether other motives could be in play Tim will be meeting with the COO on Friday He has instructions to make sure that he is not given any confidential data and that no commitment will be made then without consulting the litigation team Potential for Criminal Investigation The news of the investigation and all of our involvement has raised questions in the mind of some employees as to whether there is a risk of personal liability for them civil or criminal I reported that all we know is that there is an investigation under way by the California Attorney General We have no reason to believe right now that they are focused on Enron or that Enron or any employee is a target I said that at this stage of the investigation including our investigation we do not know enough facts to evaluate the risk for individual employees We have not reviewed the trader tapes to know what has been said on those tapes If we learn of facts that are specific to an employee Mark has asked that we notify him immediately We did provide some of this same information to traders we interviewed early in the process Analysis of EPMI data I have taken a look at the deviation of the ISO energy flow on a daily basis from its day ahead schedules and compared those deviations to EPMIs The source of the data is public information that was available to decision makers at the time The comparison shows that generally speaking the ISO was short in its projection by a magnitude of times the amount that EPMI was out of balance There are some exceptions but those are rare Approaching Federal Judge for More Time Dave Noonan has pointed out that we should look carefully at the assigned federal judge and decide who from the defense group locally in San Diego would be in the best position to make the motion Holiday Contact List Dave Noonan suggested and I concurred that it makes sense for all of you who receive this report to email me with your contact information and schedule over the holiday period I will have a composite list made up

<24925000.1075853233017.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,gfergus@brobeck.com,2001-01-02 11:29:00,Status Reportis the status of projects that I am aware of Enquiry into Removal Strategy for Berg Defendants I spoke with Rich Levy of Gibson Dunn Crutcher who represents SEMPRA in the Berg gaselectric class action filed in Los Angeles I asked him whether he would tell me if they were considering removal of the Berg action He told me that he had our removal papers He asked if we had any research that we were willing to share with him He said they looked at preemption filed rate doctrine ripeness etc and concluded that ultimately we would be in state court He also said that he did not believe there were any good motions to dismiss that were worth making I told him that some of the work product was a joint defense effort that would require permission to share eg the Paul Hastings memo but that there was other work product we might be willing to share that had been done on behalf of Enron I told him that I believed that there was good ninth circuit authority that was helpful and we really believed federal court was a better forum for these types of cases He told me he was willing to look at whatever authorities we could give him I also told him that I understood that Mike Weaver represented Sempra in the San Diego cases and gave him Mikes contact information He asked for copies of our complaints and I sent them on to him He is willing to discuss the case and possibly strategic alternatives He told me that El Paso had retained David Palmer formerly of Gibson Dunn to represent them in this action El Paso and David Palmer are supposedly meeting on Wednesday January rd According to Rich their time to remove expires on January th He told me that the Berg case was originally filed in Texas by the Denver law firm Astrella Rice against El Paso That case was dismissed because the plaintiff was not a direct purchaser The plaintiffs then sought to have Southern California Edison agree to be the named plaintiff Apparently they refused Rich said they were meeting with SCE to find out what else was said There is a second gas complaint the Continental Forge case Apparently this case was filed in September but never served It has now been amended and has been served A copy is attached We obtained this copy from the plaintiffs website so it does not have a signature for file stamp but Rich Levy said it was the complaint that had been served Continental Forgecmpltpdf PUC Hearings I do not have many of the details of the hearings other than a report from Mike Day that Michael Aguirre plaintiffs counsel in our case argued before the PUC that the real culprits are the power marketers and the solution to the utilities problem is for the utilities to join the plaintiffs class action in San Diego Apparently today Aguirre was cross examining the utility and generator witnesses before the PUC attempting to aid counsel for the ratepayers trying to show that the utilities should sue the power marketers Public Record Act Request Michael Aguirre has made a public record act request for all information subpoenaed by the PUC and any other documents related to alleged wrongdoing from the ISO The PUC has set January rd as the response date for comments on the request Data Provided by ISO to the PUC The ISO has told market participants that they have provided day ahead and hour ahead schedules to the PUC Bids actual metered operations RMR OOM and OOS calls generation out of service information and import and export schedules EPMI Data Jeff Richter reported today that he believes they now understand some of the data problems with the EPMI data I am scheduled to be in Portland with Jeff on Friday to resolve the data issues and discuss integration of ongoing data collection with pending and potential discovery requests Cornerstone Teleconference Dave Noonan reports that Michael Keeley at Cornerstone is very interested in being retained One of his partners has been contacted by another defendant but has not yet been retained by them yet Dave suggested that we try and do a telephone interview of Michael tomorrow and retain him if we like what we hear His CV is set forth below I will try to coordinate a time tomorrow morning AG Investigation So far the California AG has been reducing the scope of its data retention request For EES they basically wanted a snapshot and nothing else for the time being As for individual computers they want an organizational chart to select computers that they are interested in EPMI Tapes Prepared in Anticipation of Litigation We are awaiting specific model information about the Nicelog taping system used in Portland Dan Dietrich in IT in Houston is getting that information for us We believe we will have access to some technology that will assist in the review of these materials We will also distribute shortly the results of our research on the production of such materials and any exact transcripts prepared of those litigation materials Current Trading Practices Christian Yoder Steve Hall Marcus Woods Alan Comnes Dan Watkiss Richard Sanders and myself discussed current trading practices in the out of market and over cap scenarios In short if the ISO calls for power minutes before the hour it is needed there is no cap In some instances EPMI will have purchased power for x and offer to sell it to the ISO at x The plus factor being the credit risk andor the refund risk for having sold that power in addition to prevailing market conditions In the over cap situation EPMI will be collecting its cost data to compare with the prices charged the ISO or PX EPMI will be matching its ISO and PX sales data with comparable high cost energy in its portfolio This is consistent with FERC preexisting practice We also discussed standard instructions to traders Price Gouging Statute Richard Sanders has asked that we revisit the California Price Gouging Statute in view of the current trading practices California Penal Code section prohibits price increases upon the proclamation of a state of emergency by the President Governor or executive officer of any county or city resulting from a natural or manmade disaster For thirty days after such a proclamation it is unlawful for any business to sell or offer to sell any consumer goods goods or services used for emergency cleanup for a price of more than percent above the price charged by that person for those goods or services immediately prior to the proclamation of emergency Such a violation is a misdemeanor punishable by one year of jail time and a fine of up to A violation also constitutes an unlawful business practice under section It is unclear whether this statute includes the sale of electricity and or the declaration of a state of emergency by the ISO Ed Kee Engagement Letter Mike Kirby forwarded the form of engagement letter from Ed Kee Charles River Engagement Letter I have been in discussions with Charles River over the form of the engagement letter I hope to have that resolved shortly Thanks Gary Michael Keeley Senior Vice President Menlo Park Office El Camino Real Menlo Park CA mailto

<12564567.1075853234694.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,gfergus@brobeck.com,2001-02-01 04:15:00,Withdrawal from PX Core Market Cc Here is my quick reaction to the idea of Enron terminating its PX participation agreement in the Core Market PX tariff says that a participation agreement may be terminated by either party upon written notice PX tariff says with respect to the Core Market Proportional ChargeBack Methodology The PX Participants outstanding default amount will be charged back to all current PX Participants based upon the percentage of its gross sales in MWHs to the Total gross MWHs sales in the Core Market during the three calendar months preceding the event plus the current month to date PX Participant is a defined term An entity that is authorized to buy or sell Energy or Ancillary Services through the PX and any agent authorized to act on behalf of such entity Energy is also a defined term The electrical energy produced flowing or supplied by generation transmission or distribution facilities being the integral with respect to time of the instantaneous power measured in units of watthours or standard multiples thereof eg Wh Ancillary services is also a defined term Regulation Spinning Reserve NonSpinning Reserve Replacement Reserve Voltage Support and Black start together with such other interconnected operation services as the ISO may develop in cooperation with Market Participants to support the transmission of Energy from Generation resources to Loads while maintaining reliable operation of the ISO controlled grid in accordance with good utility practice Bottom line If a PX Participant as defined in the PX tariff as opposed to the PX rate schedule for the CTS market is an entity that is authorized to buy or sell instantaneous power rather than power in the future then Enron by withdrawing from its PX participation agreement would no longer be a current PX participant Thus there is an argument that by withdrawing in writing prior to any chargeback in the core market that Enron may be able to argue it cannot be charged back I also looked at the ADR and dispute resolution procedures to see if Enron had to be PX Participant to initiate the procedure and maintain it Schedule section states that PX ADR procedures shall apply to all disputes between parties which arise under PX Documents Section states that the PX and PX Participants shall negotiate in good faith It goes on to state in Section that any one of the parties may submit a statement of claim Thereafter in Schedule it appears that the references are to parties not PX Participants My quick reading is that you still have to use and get the benefits of the ADR even if you are no longer a PX Participant Operational Downside Does Enron have to be a PX Participant to get the PX to schedule the power that Enron has sold in the CTS market as it becomes due In other words if Enron is not a PX Participant does that mean the PX will not schedule the power leading to an Enron default under its obligations to the PX to deliver power Could that lead to the underscheduling penalty if PX balances its schedule without Enrons power I do not know the answer to this but I am reviewing the tariff Hope this helps Thanks Gary This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and privileged information Any unauthorized review use disclosure or distribution is prohibited If you are not the intended recipient please contact the sender by reply email and destroy all copies of the original message To reply to our email administrator directly send an email to BROBECK PHLEGER HARRISON LLP

California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Inc EESI Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC Enron Energy Services Operations Inc EESO and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents these entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having acquired sold divested joint ventured spun off and otherwise reorganized themselves extensively during the past two years The burden and expense on Enron to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in its organization since April is significant The Enron entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization To the extent that Enron can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods it will also make those available One Enron Entity Portland General has published books on its corporate history If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it With respect to the other entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October Requests and The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Data will identify its customers and suppliers FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities will produce its public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI ESSI and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October and the transaction data in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests and For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are very small and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and information for Enron Wind Saguaro and Las Vegas Cogeneration We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions For Portland General there will be a very large volume of documents and we propose to handle them differently First Portland General will provide for year electronic data in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant With respect to specific generating cost data because of the volume we suggest that these documents be made available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of facilities If there are specific documents that the Commission would like copied from that production we can discuss the arrangements for producing these documents We propose to make these documents available in Portland in a third wave of document productions TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Request We understand that the CPUC will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of trading data for year in California and outside of California and Real Time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is purchase or sale Because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMIs customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EESI can also provide similar electronic data with the proviso that it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number Many of ESSIs customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to object ESSI cannot meet your time frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require We anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission If you have any questions or comments about our proposal please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day or myself Brobeck Phleger Harrison LLP Gary Fergus This email message is for the sole use of the

has offered a bounty or more for information leading to successful false claims act cases that show that wholesale prices were too high Thanks Gary Original Message From Smith Amanda D Sent Tuesday April PM To Fergus Gary S Subject False Claims Act Gary This is a brief description of the relevant provisions of the California False Claims Act As we discussed a more indepth analysis will follow in memo form Amanda The California False Claims Act CFCA available at California Government Code Section et seq provides that any person natural person corporation firm etc who commits various acts shall be liable to the state or political subdivision city county etc for treble damages sustained because of those acts That person may also be liable for a civil penalty of up to for each false claim and for the costs of any civil action brought to recover any penalties or damages Initially the CFCA defines claim as including any request or demand for money property or services made to any employee officer or agent of the state or of any political subdivision or to any contractor grantee or other recipient whether under contract or not if any portion of the money property or services requested or demanded issued from or was provided by the state or by any political subdivision thereof The CFCA then describes those acts which subject a person to treble damages The covered acts potentially relevant to Enron are Knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to an officer or employee of the state or of any political subdivision thereof a false claim for payment or approval Sec a Knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to get a false claim paid or approved by the state or by any political subdivision Sec a Conspiring to defraud the state or any political subdivision by getting a false claim allowed or paid by the state or by any political subdivision Sec a Having possession custody or control of public property or money used or to be used by the state or by any political subdivision and knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered less property than the amount for which the person receives a certificate or receipt Sec a Knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to conceal avoid or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the state or to any political subdivision Sec a Being a beneficiary of an inadvertent submission of a false claim to the state or a political subdivision who subsequently discovers the falsity of the claim and fails to disclose the false claim to the state or the political subdivision within a reasonable time after discovery of the false claim Sec a Section of the CFCA provides inter alia that a person a qui tam plaintiff may bring a civil action for a violation of this article for the person and either for the State of California in the name of the state if any state funds are involved or for a political subdivision in the name of the political subdivision if political subdivision funds are exclusively involved Once filed the action may be dismissed only with the written consent of the court taking into account the best interests of the parties involved and the public purposes behind this act Section goes on to describe the procedures whereby the State or a Political Subdivision may intervene in a suit filed by a qui tam plaintiff and how the damages recovered in such a suit shall be divided Several other provisions of Section could be extremely important When a qui tam plaintiff brings an action under this subdivision no other person qui tam plaintiff may bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action Sec c A qui tam plaintiff may not bring an action that is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the state or political subdivision is already a party Sec d A qui tam plaintiff may only be an original source with direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based A qui tam plaintiff may not obtain information from the news media or from public disclosure of the information in governmental or regulatory hearings investigations reports etc and use it to bring suit under the CFCA Sec d If the qui tam plaintiff is a state employee that person must exhaust various internal procedures before filing suit under the CFCA Sec d If the state a political subdivision or the qui tam plaintiff proceeds with the action the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses against the party that proceeded with the action if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim was clearly frivolous clearly vexatious or brought solely for purposes of harassment Sec g Other relevant provisions of the CFCA include The CFCA defines knowing and knowingly to mean that a person with respect to information A Has actual knowledge of the information B Acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information or C Acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information Importantly proof of specific intent to defraud is not required Sec b The CFCA has various damages limitations provisions for defendants who cooperate with the States investigation The CFCA has various whistleblower provisions protecting employees who disclose information about false claims In any action brought under Section the state the political subdivision or the qui tam plaintiff shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action including damages by a preponderance of the evidence Sec c This email message is for the sole use of the intended

California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Inc EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC Enron Energy Services Operations Inc EESO and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis We believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION Generally speaking the documents and information that the Commission seeks can be found if they exist within EPMI EES and Portland General To the extent that EEMC or EESO are relevant to the Commissions investigation any documents would be located within EES Thus we do not anticipate specific document productions from either EEMC or EESO GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having acquired sold divested joint ventured spun off and otherwise reorganized themselves extensively during the past two years The burden and expense on Enron to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in its organization since April is significant The Enron entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization To the extent that Enron can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods it will also make those available One Enron Entity Portland General has published books on its corporate history If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it With respect to the other entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October Requests and The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI EES and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data It is intended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial information regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its investigation We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests and For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and information for Enron Wind Saguaro and Las Vegas Cogeneration We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions For Portland General the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as Portland General owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand As a result we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited In addition those transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are limited to sales to the ISO and PX and long term contracts with two small California municipal utilities Thus the Commission will receive the essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and PX Nevertheless Portland General proposes to provide for year electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the California market At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market Alternate ending to paragraph We propose for the voluminous Portland General generating cost and maintenance data that these documents be made available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of facilities If there are specific documents that the Commission would like copied from that production we can discuss the arrangements for producing these documents We propose to make these documents available in Portland in a third wave of document productions TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests and We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction data for year in California and outside of California and Real Time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or a sale Because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMIs customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EES is a retail provider of electricity and plays a far more limited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the Commission investigation However EES can also provide similar electronic Transaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number This additional restriction is important to EES because many of EESs customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to object EES cannot meet your time frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of retail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the wholesale market we do not believe protecting the identity of retail customers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request We anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order In addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission If you have any questions or comments about our proposal please do not hesitate to contact

those entities As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production Enron Energy Services Operations Inc is the parent of Enron Energy Services Inc and does not have operating

EES confidentiality obligations to those customers We anticipate producing the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that

order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order In addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission If you have any questions or

<9873692.1075853229841.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,gfergus@brobeck.com,2000-10-06 07:58:00,FW Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenasis your copy of the final version sent to the Commission Thanks Gary Original Message From Fergus Gary S Sent Friday October PM To Cc MBD Subject Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis We believe that the production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges Generally speaking the Enron Entities propose to produce documents for year as noted below We also understand that the Commission will be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production Enron Energy Services Operations Inc is the parent of Enron Energy Services Inc and does not have operating authority or engage in wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy Thus the documents offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy Services Inc but we have designated them both as EES We also do not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests through Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities businesses the burden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April is significant The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of their current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization To the extent that the Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods they will also make those available One Enron Entity Portland General has published books on its corporate history If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it With respect to the other Enron Entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October Requests and The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers We believe this information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the staffs purposes FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI EES and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data the Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which information includes economic data We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests and For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions For Portland General the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as Portland General owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand As a result we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited Nevertheless Portland General proposes to provide for year electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant as discussed below We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the California market At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests and We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant transaction data for year in California and outside of California and Real Time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or a sale Because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMIs customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES confidentiality obligations to those customers We anticipate producing the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order In addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission If

Original Message From Morris Harvey Y mailto Sent Wednesday October PM To Fergus Gary S Morris Harvey Y Cc MBD Subject RE Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Gentlemen This will confirm our tentative agreement to your email subject to our right to followup under the subpoenas already issued to the extent that the Enron Entities responses on Oct and Oct are not sufficient For example per your request we will review the electronic data base you provide us on the various transactions before we decide whether we will insist on the confidential financial records addressing any of the Enron Entities profits or losses in the purchase and sale of electricity in the WSCC You also stated that we would receive the electronic data base for on Oct and that you will check with your clients as to how soon you can get us the data for the transactions from June through December This will further confirm that your response to the subpoenas on behalf of the Enron Entities includes Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC as your Oct cover letter states Therefore as Mike Day orally agreed in todays telephone conversation there is no need for the Commission to reissue or serve a new subpoena on EEMC Original Message From Fergus Gary S mailto mailto Sent Friday October PM To Cc MBD Subject Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis We believe that the production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections

understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges Generally speaking the Enron Entities propose to produce documents for year as noted below We also understand that the Commission will be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production Enron Energy Services Operations Inc is the parent of Enron Energy Services Inc and does not have operating authority or

its corporate history If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it With respect to the other Enron Entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October Requests and The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers We believe this information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the staffs purposes FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI EES and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data the Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which information includes economic data We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests and For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and

one half of its total energy demand As a result we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited Nevertheless Portland General proposes to provide for year electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant as

into the California market At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests and We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO

incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMIs customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES confidentiality obligations to those customers We anticipate producing the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order In addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if

<15516540.1075853230825.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,gfergus@brobeck.com,2000-10-24 07:45:00,Some thoughts on options Cc AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE Richard After todays discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on options WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others If the protective order has not changed then unilaterally postpone production until it is Pro Better protection and more time Con Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled to financial performance data Thus this option does not fully disclose all of Enrons positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics Under this option we file our formal objections as well TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered Pro PUC will get the data anyway either through FERC unfair competition antitrust or price gouging litigation By turning over the data that will show profits PUC might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose witnesses etc Con This would be waiving the legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUCs ability to discovery this information through a subpoena There is also a question of how confidential this data would be given the current political agenda It might also serve to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron information and discovery This option would also provide confidential proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive advantage TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF DATA FROM ISO AND PX We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give only missing data PRO It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of California data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question Con Without Enron cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want a profit and loss picture We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that the combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need to calculate the answers to Request Nos TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data Pro It would not reveal the profit and loss information Con It would not reveal the profit and loss information In other words the PUC is clear that this is what they are after By giving them everything else we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and loss Moreover by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX data the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be quite large but just not the cost or expense side DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position for the following reasons Our firm belief that the PUC is not entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking in his latest email Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more data than we discussed earlier continued threat that if they do not like the transaction data they will come back and ask for profit and loss information that we do not believe they are entitled to Commissioner Woods statement that the purpose of this investigation is to get money from market participants in the hands of consumers investigation by the AG into activities of other market participants and the notice that other governmental agencies are cooperating who are we producing this information to and for what purpose Enron favors public disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to do so Enron is a small player in this market and many other market participants are not involved in the process BPA etc PRO This may be the only way to preserve Enrons challenge to the jurisdiction of the PUC to get this data Moreover in the current political environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked It also makes sense to see what FERC will do with their published report on investigation date Under this option we file our formal objections and sit back and wait ME TOO Upon reflection we agree with the approach taken by the other market participants We will not produce until the protective order is modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction PRO This makes it look like all the market participants are acting in concert and really is no different than option above Moreover if you read Reliants responses they appear ready to turn over financial data if the protective order is modified Terry and Mike Day are both out of their offices today Note that Williams is adopting a strategy that says the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena This may be met with strong opposition by the PUC given their California constitutional contempt authority MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits before the ALJ PRO The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions It has the least procedural risks of being dismissed CON Reading the tea leaves we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the PUC has no jurisdiction Moreover because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted contempt power the PUC will take the view according to Mike Day that they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement They will also take the view that the Superior Court has no jurisdiction to hear our appeal Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at the Court of Appeal level Thus the only de novo review of our objections might be at the ALJ level FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act and in particular the provisions of g under which the PUC issued its subpoena in part The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and loss information from the wholesale market The authority for this would be Mississippi Power Light v Mississippi US bright line between wholesale market regulated by FERC and the retail market regulated by states Bristol Energy Corp v New Hampshire Fd st Cir federal question whether state agency can inquire into business and financial data in the wholesale market but found no cognizable claim PRO The federal forum may be more even handed than the ALJ but the question is whether we can state a cognizable claim There may be greater protections from disclosure of the information as well CON The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless we are able to obtain injunctive relief The PUC might seek discovery of the same information in the Federal court proceeding We should assume that this action will trigger the strongest response from the PUC andor the AG in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same information eg unfair business practice suit price gouging antitrust etc We should anticipate deposition requests for traders etc By taking this position we will clearly be conceding that if FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority SEPARATE RESPONSESSTRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland General EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from those entities PRO The information provided for these entities is not likely to generate profit and loss information that would be germane to the fight we are about to engage in eg EESs description of off tariff rates for example For Portland General Dave Aamodt is out of the office and not able to participate in any change of direction discussions Hope this is

filed even though the November draft order is not yet final Cal PX said they could not implement the software necessary to run the soft caps by January st The City San Diego requested rehearing on the issue of whether FERC has the authority to order refunds The City of San Diegos Friday filing said the SDGE had M in its balancing account that it would be seeking from ratepayers The City argued that because their were not just and reasonable rates the filed rate doctrine is not called into question Charles Dick I spoke with Charles Dick about his personal availability He told me that he understood we were asking for a personal commitment from him He has one matter that is set for arbitration in June that will take a significant amount of this time He has other matters but is willing to personally commit the time necessary for this engagement He had the same approach as in the interview not selling himself but being completely responsive David Noonan David called to tell me he had left messages for Richard but they had not connected yet In part it was because David was in deposition We discussed conflict issues at some length In the copper cases where he represents SCE they have a and share of the damages at issue Thus he is not acting as longstanding SCE counsel He said that he did not believe that he could get a written forward looking waiver since the general counsel does not see this representation as a current conflict He agreed however that he would be able to confirm that in the event that Enron and SCE become adverse while he would not be able to represent either entity in that litigation if he is still representing them in the copper litigation SCE would not claim that his continued representation of Enron in the nonadverse matters was a violation of the duty of loyalty David was going to continue to try and connect with Richard Larry Ruff Larry has reviewed the preliminary data that we were proposing to release to the PUC In particular I asked him to take the view of a regulator and use the data to show market power withholding electricity etc He told me that the data was not all that helpful in any of those regards First he found the same anomalies later in the year with respect to energy purchased and energy sold He also had some questions about the identity of various counterparties used in the system He found that the data did not include price by the hour instead only the hour aggregate To the extent that we want to understand what happened during peak periods we would need the detailed data We also discussed finding out what sources of public market data were available to understand what was happening in the market to compare the Enron data with Larry has completed the initial quick look that we asked for He will be in Australia for the next few months We have made arrangements for encrypted email etc to be available so that we may consult with him as needed Tariffs and FERC related Materials Jean asked for the reference to the legal requirement to submit a balanced schedule etc Peter Meringolo from our office gathered this material earlier and we include it below We also enclose Ron Carols brief that he sent us that challenges the penalty provisions of the ISO tariff That litigation has been ongoing for a number of years The requirement for EPMI to submit a balanced schedule is found in the ISO tariff at section A Scheduling Coordinator shall submit to the ISO only Balanced Schedules in the DayAhead Market and the HourAhead Market A Schedule shall be treated as a Balanced Schedule when aggregate Generation InterScheduling Coordinator Energy Trades whether purchases or sales and imports or exports to or from external Control Areas adjusted for Transmission Losses as appropriate equals aggregate forecast Demand with respect to all entities for which the Scheduling Coordinator schedules in each zone If a Scheduling Coordinator submits a Schedule that is not a Balanced Schedule the ISO shall reject that Schedule provided that Scheduling Coordinators shall have an opportunity to validate their schedules prior to the deadline for submission to the ISO by requesting such validation prior to the applicable deadline The ISO Market Monitoring Information Protocol MMIP sets forth the standards for Anomalous Market Behavior See MMIP Anomalous market behavior which is defined as behavior that departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or unexplained market outcomes Evidence of such behavior may be derived from a number of circumstances including withholding Generation capacity under circumstances in which it would normally be offered in a competitive market unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by Generators unusual trades or transactions pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions eg prices and bids that appear consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions and unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports form or exports to other markets and exchanges The MMIP also prohibits Gaming See MMIP Gaming or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs Protocols or Activity Rules or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion to the detriment of the efficiency of and of consumers in the ISO Markets Gaming may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity such as loop flow facility outages level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy imports from outofstate or actions or behaviors that may otherwise render the system and the ISO Markets vulnerable to price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency The ISO MMIP allows the ISO to do any of the following among other things as a result of an entitys Anomalous Market Behavior or Gaming impose such sanctions or penalties as it believes necessary and as are permitted under the ISO Tariff See MMIP refer to such regulatory or antitrust agency as it sees fit to recommend the imposition of sanctions and penalties See MMIP publicize in whatever medium it believes most appropriate the

todays activities Attorney General Investigation Mike Day Enrons outside counsel that does work before the PUC called me late tonight to tell me that he was contacted by another attorney that has done work for Enron in the past This other attorney received a call from the California State Attorney Generals office Richard Rothman phonetic stating that the AG was going to be sending out preservation of documents letters to market participants including Enron and that they were going to be issuing subpoenas in the very near future California Energy Oversight Board Some recipients of this email may not have been included on the list that got copies of the subpoena requests to the California ISO and California PX so I will duplicate them here EOBpdf Confidenpdf EOBoardpdf EOBoardpdf Enron Investigation in Canada FYI dowjonesPDF EPMI Western Trading Desk Organization Chart Organizational chartPDF Change of Venue Research by Peter Meringolo Heres preliminary analysis of change of venue The court may change the venue of a trial where there is reason to believe that an impartial trial cannot be had therein CCP o b The party requesting a change of venue must show actual widespread prejudice extending over a long period of time Nguyen v Superior Court Cal App th Whether such a showing has been made is left to the discretion of the trial court Id Case law provides little guidance regarding how much evidence is enough for a party to show actual prejudice As Witkin states this challenge is so vague and difficult to sustain Witkin Cal Procedure Actions o th ed In fact a change of venue on these grounds has been granted in very few reported cases the most recent of which was in See People v Ocean Shore RR Cal App d San Joaquin and Kings River Canal and Irrigation Co v Stevinson Cal Ocean Shore was an eminent domain proceeding against defendant land owners to acquire lands to build a state highway one defendants motion for change of venue was granted People v Ocean Shore RR Cal App d The defendant filed nearly affidavits which referenced newspaper articles reports from civic meetings and statements by citizens showing a widespread prejudice against the defendants and its cause extending over a long period of years Id at The Court affirmed the trial courts discretion noting that the affidavits show that it would at least make it extremely doubtful whether an impartial trial could be had before a jury in that county Id at San Joaquin was a condemnation action for the use of waters of a river for the benefit of landowners on the west side of the river San Joaquin and Kings River Canal and Irrigation Co v Stevinson Cal In that action the defendant operated an irrigation system for the benefit of the landowners on the east side of the river Plaintiff filed one affidavit showing that the people on the east side of the river felt widespread prejudice against plaintiff and people on the west side of the river were disqualified as jurors because they were using defendants irrigation system Id at Defendant filed affidavits in opposition According to the Court if numbers of affiants or of affidavits were the determining factor in questions of this character the defendant herein would have been entitled to prevail upon said motion but this is not the rule Id at Rather the question is whether the trial court abused its discretion and the Court held that it did not These cases are contrasted with two case reported since in which change of venue motions were denied See Riverside County Flood Control and Water Conservation Dist v Joseph W Wolfskill Co Cal App d Nguyen v Superior Court Cal App th Riverside County was an eminent domain proceeding where plaintiff was seeking to condemn property for the purposes of flood control Defendants moved for a change of venue by presenting evidence that the advantages of the flood control project was widely publicized the newspapers portrayed defendants as trying to prevent flood controls that the cost of purchasing defendants property was to come from county funds and therefore every taxpayer was adverse to defendant Cal App d at Plaintiffs affidavit contradicted these facts The trial court denied the motion and this decision was affirmed on appeal Id at In Nguyen the State brought a suit against business owners in order to shut down a red light district in San Mateo The defendant businesses moved for a change of venue Defendants evidence consisted of two newspaper articles reporting the raid on the businesses that the city spent over investigating and one affidavit of an employee of defendants lawyer The trial court denied the motion because the evidence fell far short of proving actual prejudice Cal App th at Moreover the trial was to be a court trial not a jury trial and defendants showed no prejudice by the court Id Ross v Kalin Cal App although an extreme case exemplifies that a change of venue motion most likely requires a high standard of proof In Ross plaintiffs motion for change of venue was denied Plaintiff filed numerous affidavits in which uncontroverted facts showed that as a result of plaintiffs crusade against vice conditions in the City of venue plaintiff was assaulted by a mob beaten tarred and feathered and chained to a tree Id at The local newspaper published editorials approving the mob action Id Plaintiffs attorney was also assaulted and beaten and banned from two organizations Id Of the to potential jurors between and were prejudiced against the plaintiff at some point in time Id at The appellate court affirmed holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that this prejudice against the plaintiffs did not outweigh the defendants right to have their case tried in the county where they reside and their witnesses reside Id

citizenship issue it is unlikely that every class member will meet the amount in controversy requirement We also have the preliminary reports that Sempra Energy Resources is a California corporation that is selling electrical energy into the California PX market See December status report I need to followup and find out if Sempra Energy Resources has outside counsel yet and confirm their understanding on this issue Federal Question and Related Primary Jurisdiction Argument All of us need to understand the interrelationship between the FERCPUCISO investigations and this class action There is also the pending challenge to the ISO MMIPs by Enron and others that has been pending for some time Does the complaint fairly raise or necessarily implicate a federal question Change of Venue Additional Research by Peter Meringolo I have researched case law involving class actions where class members are jurors I found only two nonCalifornia cases and both involve change of venue motions See Beech v Leaf River Forest Prods So d Miss Toledo Fair Hous Ctr v Nationwide Mut Ins Co NEd Ohio Ct Com Pl These cases however do not change the analysis required under CCP o b In Beech plaintiffs brought a nonclass action lawsuit against defendants for polluting two rivers with dioxin Defendants moved for a change of venue In addition to evidence of negative publicity defendants showed that of the potential jurors were plaintiffs in other dioxin cases against these defendants and even more were potential class members in a class action brought against these same defendants in another county Beech So d at The trial court granted defendants motion because the negative publicity and the large number of jurors involved in similar litigation would prevent the defendants from receiving a fair trial Id The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion Id Toledo Fair involved a class action against Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company Nationwide moved for a change of venue arguing among other things that because of the large size of the class a significant percentage of veniremen would be either class members or relatives of class members and would thus be ineligible to sit as jurors Toledo Fair NEd at Plaintiffs argued that Nationwide exaggerated the size of the class Id The court denied the motion holding that because of the dispute regarding the size of the class it was too early to determine whether an impartial jury could be impaneled The court clearly left open the possibility for Nationwide to renew this motion We also discussed the remote possibility of challenging the judge who would hear this case under Section for cause because the Judge would be part of the class Dave Noonan has had experience in the egg case with this type of challenge Consolidation Dave and Mike will look at how to manage a consolidation with Judge Amos under San Diego local rules if that is what we decided to do Keeping in mind that the

May PM To Fergus Gary S Subject FW Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High Original Message From Fergus Gary S Sent Monday October AM To Meringolo Peter Subject FW Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High FYI Thanks Gary Original Message From Fergus Gary S Sent Friday October PM To Cc MBD Subject Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis We believe that the production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges Generally speaking the Enron Entities propose to produce documents for year as noted below We also understand that the Commission will be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production Enron Energy Services Operations Inc is the parent of Enron Energy Services Inc and does not have operating authority or engage in wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy Thus the documents offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy Services Inc but we have designated them both as EES We also do not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests through Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities businesses the burden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April is significant The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of their current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization To the extent that the Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods they will also make those available One Enron Entity Portland General has published books on its corporate history If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it With respect to the other Enron Entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October Requests and The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers We believe this information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the staffs purposes FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI EES and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data the Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which information includes economic data We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests and For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions For Portland General the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as Portland General owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand As a result we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited Nevertheless Portland General proposes to provide for year electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant as discussed below We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the California market At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests and We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant transaction data for year in California and outside of California and Real Time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or a sale Because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMIs customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES confidentiality obligations to those customers We anticipate producing the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order In addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission If you have any questions or comments about our proposal please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day or myself Brobeck Phleger Harrison LLP Gary Fergus

case against Enron to federal court It is not as promising as we first thought Thanks Gary Original Message From Smith Amanda D Sent Thursday May PM To Fergus Gary S Cc Molland Michael E Meringolo Peter Subject Enron Response to Criminal Charges Gary Our earlier preliminary research reflected the fact that although it will likely be difficult it may be possible under the primary jurisdiction doctrine to refer criminal charges to FERC given the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act However as it becomes more clear that if criminal charges are to be filed they will be filed in California it is necessary to revisit and expand this earlier research We noted earlier that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the Federal Power Act specifically Based on this we concluded that it may be possible if difficult to argue that criminal charges should be referred to FERC under the primary jurisdiction doctrine An expansion of this research reveals that this potential for referral appears to only be applicable to federal criminal charges State criminal charges are not removable under USC Section which provides that except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction may be removed by the defendant or the defendants to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending Moreover our research has revealed no case in which state criminal charges were referred directly to any federal regulatory agency However our research has revealed another alternative to removal or referral of criminal charges See generally Sprint Corp v Evans MD Al FSupp Sprint Corp v Evans MD Al FSupp In the Attorney General of Alabama began an investigation of Sprint Corporation an international telecommunications company acting as a common carrier within the meaning of the federal Communications Act Sprint among other things provided a service to subscribers pursuant to tariffs filed with the FCC To use these numbers a caller places a call through a local telephone company who connects the call to a long distance carrier such as Sprint who generally then connected the call to the subscribers local telephone number In February Sprint received a subpoena from the Montgomery County Grand Jury commanding it to appear and produce all records relating to the service Sprint produced the documents and learned that it was under investigation for violation of Alabamas obscenity laws in connection with allegedly obscene content distributed over telephone lines In March Sprint filed a motion for a temporary restraining order TRO and a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Alabama Attorney General from pursuing a criminal indictment against Sprint for violation of the obscenity law Sprint maintained enforcement of the antiobscenity law would interfere with federal statutory rights because regulation of interstate communications is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the FCC At the TRO hearing the Attorney General could not testify that the prosecution was not imminent and therefore the court issued the TRO Later in March the Court decided Sprints motion for a preliminary injunction Sprint Corp v Evans MD Al FSupp At the hearing on this motion counsel for the Attorney General stated that the Attorney Generals position regarding Sprints criminal liability under the obscenity statute related to the its obligations under that law when a telephone customer complains that a subscribers message is offensive According to counsel if a customer complains Sprint is obligated to either report the complaint to a prosecuting attorney or begin a declaratory judgment action against the subscriber The District Court granted the preliminary injunction The court held that under the relevant Eleventh Circuit test for determining whether a preliminary injunction should issue the movant must show a substantial likelihood that she will ultimately prevail on the merits that she will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party and that if issued the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest Sprint FSupp at Before the Court considered the first element of this test the Court addressed the contention that the District Court had no jurisdiction The Court held that the Supreme Court however has held that federal courts have federalquestion jurisdiction under USCA S to entertain suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal statutory rights The Court then held that there was a substantial likelihood that Sprint would prevail on the merits because to the extent that the Alabama antiobscenity statute attempts to impose reporting requirements on communications by common carriers it is interstate in nature and preempted by federal law The statute is being used as a mechanism to impose new reporting requirements on common carriers with regard to their service Currently under federal law common carriers do not have an affirmative obligation to investigate whether their facilities are being used by customers for a lawful purpose Importantly the Court did not reach the question whether the Communications Act preempts all Alabama laws imposing liability for conduct of common carriers in the area of obscenity The Court also rejected the Attorney Generals argument that a Younger abstention was necessary The Court disposed of the last three parts of the preliminary injunction test easily First the Court held that irreparable harm would result because an indictment against Sprint would cause great harm to its business reputation and would jeopardize its status as a government contractor Second the Court held that the potential harm to Sprint outweighed the potential harm to the Attorney General because although the Attorney General relies on a state statute directed at the prosecution of the distribution of obscene matter the Attorney General really seeks to impose interstate reporting requirements on common carriersin other words the generic proceeding at issue is the regulation of interstate telecommunications by common carriers outside the context of the distribution of obscene matter The Attorney General clearly has no interest in such interstate regulation Third the Court held that the preliminary injunction serves the public interest by ensuring that the national interest in fulfilling the goals of the Federal Communications Act Sprint FSupp at In a separate decision almost a year later the District Court granted in part Sprints motion to refer certain issues to the FCC under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction Sprint FSupp at Prior to this motion the Alabama Attorney General changed its allegations regarding the illegality of Sprints conduct under the obscenity law now alleging that Sprint was not criminally liable because of a failure to report but because of a aiding and abetting theory The District Court held in brief that referral to FCC under primary jurisdiction doctrine was warranted with regard to question of whether common carriers consistent with Communications Act may refuse to carry information providers program transmitted as service if program contains sexually explicit information that has not been adjudicated obscene and referral to FCC was not warranted with respect to question of whether attempted criminal prosecution of interstate common carrier under states antiobscenity laws for knowingly transmitting potentially obscene or obscene telephone communications through its interstate facilities is preempted by Communications Act Sprint FSupp at The Court then ordered that the record of the case be transmitted to the FCC that the preliminary injunction remain in effect and that all motions would be denied without prejudice until after the FCC rendered its decision Obviously no analysis of the criminal charges against Enron can yet be made but there is a significant chance that Enron may be able to cast any criminal charges filed by the California Attorney General as regulatory in nature Moreover given relative lack of effect the Alabama Attorney Generals change in position in the middle of the Sprint case the regulatory aspect of the charges may not be as important as it may seem in the first Sprint holding on the preliminary injunction Please let me know if you would

PM To Michael L Kirby Email Cc Molland Michael E Smith Amanda D Subject Draft Research Memorandum on Senator Dunn Issues Mike Here is the draft research memo that Amanda prepared on some of the questions surrounding Senator Dunns investigation some of this you saw before Legislative Committee Subpoena Power Government Code Section provides that a subpoena requiring the attendance of any witness before the Senate Assembly or a committee may be issued by the President of the Senate Speaker of the Assembly or the chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the witness is desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee of the respective house There is a relative dearth of case law interpreting Govt Code et seq and the Govt Code reporters cross reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections on issuance of subpoenas CCP et seq Therefore it is possible that the provisions of both the Govt Code and the CCP will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena issued by a legislative committee Govt Code Section provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it a states whether the proceeding is before the Senate Assembly or a committee b is addressed to the witness presumably the custodian of records when documents are sought c requires the attendance of the witness at a time and place certain and d is signed by the President of the Senate Speaker of the Assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the witness is desired If the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or neglects or refuses to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books papers or document sin his possession or under his control he has committed a contempt Govt Code Section If the contempt is committed while the Legislature is in session Govt Code Section provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the Senate or Assembly for such action as may be deemed necessary by the Senate or Assembly If the Legislature is not in session the superior court in and for the county in which any inquiry investigation hearing or proceeding is held may compel the production of books papers documents and accounts as required by the subpoena issued by the committee on the filing by the committee of a petition to the court asking that the witness be so compelled Govt Code Section provides that any witness neglecting or refusing to attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested It is unclear how this provision would or whether it could be applied to a subpoena issued to the custodian of records of a nonresident company Motion to Quash Subpoena California courts have held under CCP Section that a motion to quash is the procedurally appropriate method of testing the validity of a subpoena duces tecum See eg People ex rel Dept of Public Works v Younger CalAppd My research has revealed no case in which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has been challenged by a motion to quash but as noted above there appear to be only a very few cases interpreting Govt Code et seq Therefore it appears that a superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a subpoena issued by a legislative committee assuming that we want to take the risk of state court jurisdiction In one early case the Court of Appeal held that the contempt order and accompanying affidavit issued by the Court upon the request of a Senate Committee were fatally defective Ex Parte McLain CalAppd In McLain the Senate Interim Committee on Social Welfare served upon Mr McLain the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of a corporation a subpoena calling for the production of various books papers and documents Mr McLain appeared before the committee but refused to answer questions or produce the documents Upon representation of the Committee the Superior Court issued an order directing Mr McLain to produce the documents Mr McLain again appeared before the Committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point an affidavit was filed in Superior Court stating That based upon evidence in its possession the said Senate Interim Committee has determined that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No and That each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and that the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No The Superior Court found Mr McLain guilty of contempt and ordered him committed to the sheriff until he produced the records The Court of Appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for In cases of constructive contempt as is this not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the offense McLain at This holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting CCP which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege material facts rather than conclusory statements See eg Grannis v Board of Medical Examiners CalAppd However cases interpreting CCP also require the subpoena to demonstrate a level of specificity materiality and relevance to be held proper See eg Pacific Auto Ins Co v Superior Court CalAppd It is unclear whether subpoenas issued by legislative committees are held to this same standard What is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued against the Enron custodian of records an outofstate resident intended to affect the production of outofstate Enron documents Here are the threshold questions A Since we have found so few cases interpreting Govt Code Section to what extent would a legislative committee subpoena be governed by the same procedural and substantive rules as a subpoena issued in a pending civil state court action B Would a court determining the validity of a legislative committee subpoena make reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections governing subpoenas generally ie CCP et seq or those governing deposition subpoenas ie CCP et seq This is a tossup and the answer may well be both The Government Code reporter sections on legislative subpoenas cross references to CCP et seq subpoenas generally However the deposition subpoena provisions CCP et seq more closely resemble the discovery process that the Senator seems to be undertaking Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq CCP is entitled Residency requirements for attendance of witnesses and provides that A witness including a witness specified in subdivision b of Section is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court judge justice or any other officer unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service There is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by Section Section provides when a subpoena duchess mecum is served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided in Article commencing with Section of Chapter of Division of the Evidence Code and his personal attendance is not required by the terms of the subpoena Section shall not apply Evade Code lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records where the business is neither a party nor the place where any cause of action is alleged to have arisen On commentator noted the following with respect to CCP The rule limiting subpoenas to California residents CCP does not apply to subpoenas duchess mecum served on custodians of records unless their personal attendance is required See CCP Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London CalAppth fn Thus a nonresident custodian of business records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon him or her while present in California by producing the records in accordance with Cal Evid Code delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court clerk However CCP probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to California jurisdiction Otherwise there would be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident See Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London supra Werner Fairbanks Epstein Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Trials at Moreover in one unpublished case Allee v King CalAppd the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to produce original outofstate documents at trial In so holding the court stated that even though King apparently voluntarily attended the trial his presence does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the outofstate documents Although section uses the word witness and does not refer to documents it has long been presumed under common law that documents in other states are outside the courts territorial jurisdiction so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence instead of originals See eg Heinz v Heinz CalAppd Pd and cases cited therein The recognition that outofstate documents are not subject to the courts process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that absent a statute properly conferring broader powers the extent of a states subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders See CJS Witnesses S p S p S p AmJurd Witnesses S p S p However the Allee court notes that the stateborder limitation on subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are outofstate Therefore even under Allee if a subpoena was issued to a California Enron entity that possessed responsive documents that Enron entity may be obligated to respond See Boal v Price Waterhouse Co CalAppd Therefore if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an outofstate officer of Enron Enron has a very good argument that that witness is not obligated to attend under CCP It also seems probable that under Amoco and Allele cited above if a subpoena is served on an Enron custodian of records who is employed by a nonCalifornia Enron entity the subpoena may be invalid However if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian of records or someone similarly situated who is employed by an Enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in California that Enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents It is an open question whether that custodian of records employed by an Enron entity in California would only be required to produce the Enron documents in the possession of the Enron California entity or whether that persons obligation would extend further to produce outof state documents ie documents from nonCalifornia Enron entities This question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the CCP statutory scheme see below but is still open Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq Additional threshold question If the legislative subpoena was treated as a deposition subpoena would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat Enron as a party or as a nonparty The rules governing the reach of discovery in California are obviously different for the two The deposition of a party or partyaffiliated witness may be noticed without a subpoena for a place within miles of the witness residence It is unclear how a court would resolve this issue After all if a court was resolving the issue at all an Enron entity will have appeared before it and would be a party However it seems moderately more likely that the court would treat Enrons obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was served with a nonparty subpoena There are three types of deposition subpoena a testimony only subpoena requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness a business records subpoena requires only the production of business records and a records and testimony subpoena requires both also formerly called subpoena duces tecum The second of these is the most relevant to Enron The attendance of an non party outofstate witness or the production of documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the deposition is to be taken CCP b Specifically CCP b provides If the deponent is not a party to the action or an officer director managing agent or employee of a party a party serving a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures required and available under the laws of the state territory or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to attend and to testify as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection copying and any related activity Some states issue subpoenas routinely some require a showing of materiality or relevancy and some require a commission from the court where the action is pending This question will depend on the law of the state when the custodian of records resides Regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an instate custodian of records would compel the production of outofstate documents Weil Brown Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Before Trial at notes It is unclear whether service of a business records subpoena on a nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records located outside the state CCP d requires that the subpoena be directed to the records custodian or someone authorized to certify the records Whether custodian requires actual custody of the records is unclear If it does serving an officer or agent in California would not compel production of business records located elsewhere The result is different where a records and testimony subpoena is used That procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party not merely in his or her custody If the State of California files civil suit against Enron to obtain discovery of the requested documents does the fact that the State is the plaintiff rather than a private party affect Enrons prospects for removal of the suit to federal court If the action filed by the State of California presents a federal question then under the rationale of the court in People of the State of California v Steelcase Inc CD Cal FSupp the case should be removable to federal court In People of the State of California v Steelcase Inc CD Cal FSupp the District Attorney of the County of Los Angeles brought suit alleging violations of the Cartwright Act and the Unfair Competition Statutes Cal Bus Prof Code and The District Court found that although the district attorney is only allowed to prosecute Cartwright Act violations on behalf of the county or public agencies located in the county the unfair competition statutes expressly provide that suit be brought in the name of the people of the State of California Id at Therefore for the purposes of the Unfair Competition Claims the Court found that the State of California was the real party in interest The Court then found that for diversity purposes a state is not a citizen of itself Therefore it cannot sue or be sued in a diversity action Id Specifically the Court found that even assuming arguendo that defendant is correct that the County of Los Angeles is the real party in interest and the proper party in the Cartwright Act claim diversity jurisdiction does not lie because under long established teaching there must be complete diversity ie all plaintiffs must be diverse from defendant Eg Strawbridge v Curtiss US Cranch LEd Here there cannot be complete diversity because to repeat the State of California is not a citizen of any state Id that independent of its failure to meet the complete diversity test the court lacks jurisdiction over this case because of the bar of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution The Eleventh Amendment is a grant of sovereign immunity to a state against suit in federal court It is in the nature of a jurisdictional bar Defendant relying on the literal wording of the Eleventh Amendment contends that this is not a suit against one of the United States because the State is the plaintiff However since the immunity granted by the Eleventh Amendment is an immunity from being made an involuntary party to an action in federal court it should apply equally to the case where the state is a plaintiff in an action commenced in state court and the action is removed to federal court by the defendant Id internal citations removed However the Court noted that where removal is predicated on federal question jurisdiction removal is permitted even where a nonremovable claim is joined with the removable claim Id If a criminal case price gouging etc is brought against Enron is there any theory preemption primary jurisdiction or double jeopardy which would allow that criminal proceeding to be dismissed stayed or removed given the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act Our preliminary research shows that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the Federal Power Act specifically Generally in one case concerning a District Court order staying criminal action involving allegations of conspiracy and fraud against a defense contractor pending the District Courts referral of various questions regarding the case to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals the Ninth Circuit has said Our concern with the district courts stay and referral is heightened by the fact that this action is a criminal prosecution While it is true that the primary jurisdiction doctrine has been applied in criminal cases see United States v Pacific A Ry Navigation Co US United States v Yellow Freight Sys th Cir Fd its use clearly interferes with the governments authority to prosecute criminal cases We said in a related context We approach the interpretation of the statute with a presumption against a congressional intention to limit the power of the Attorney General to prosecute offenses under the criminal laws of the United States In general the conduct of federal criminal litigation is an executive function within the exclusive prerogative of the Attorney General In re Subpoena of Persico Fd d Cir quoting United States v Cox Fd th Cir Wisdom J concurring Congress may limit or reassign the prosecutorial responsibility See Case v Bowles US SCt LEd Nader v Saxbe USAppDC Fd n DCCir FTC v Guignon Fd th Cir But to graft such an exception upon the criminal law would require a clear and unambiguous expression of the legislative will United States v Morgan US SCt LEd United States v International Union of Operating Engineers Local Fd th Cir cert denied US SCt LEdd United States v General Dynamics Corp th Cir Fd The General Dynamics Court went on to say that only where an issue unambiguously requires initial agency determination under the primary jurisdiction doctrine and the referring court has the authority to review the agencys order can the agencys regulatory interests be required or allowed to subordinate the governments authority to prosecute criminal offenses Id In another context the Ninth Circuit held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies before the Federal Election Commission was not a prerequisite to indictment under the Federal Election Campaign Act neither the language nor the legislative history of the Act provides the kind of clear and unambiguous expression of legislative will necessary to support a holding that Congress sought to alter the traditionally broad scope of the Attorney Generals prosecutorial discretion by requiring initial administrative screening of alleged violations of the Act On the contrary the language and legislative history indicates that while centralizing and strengthening the authority of the FERC to enforce the Act administratively and by civil proceedings Congress intended to leave undisturbed the Justice Departments authority to prosecute criminally a narrow range of aggravated offenses United States v International Union of Operating Engineers Local Fd See also In re Grand Jury Investigation of Shipping Industry DDC FSupp though the doctrine of primary jurisdiction may be applied to both civil and to criminal actions it is more forceful in the civil regulatory type actions than in criminal actions for in the latter actions the violations of other federal statutes may more often be involved and the regulatory scheme less affected Therefore it seems clear that it will be difficult to invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to dismiss or stay criminal proceedings against Enron especially since the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act are relatively limited In addition at least one court has held in the civil context that the Federal Power Act was not designed to shift the forum for the trial of antitrust questions affecting power companies from the District Courts to the Power Commission FERCs predecessor Pennsylvania Water Power Co v Consolidated Gas Electric Light Power Co th Cir Fd I have not been able to find any case directly on point which invokes double jeopardy type arguments In other words if there are possible criminal penalties under the Federal Power Act and the same conduct is at issue that was examined by FERC would State law criminal charges based upon the same conduct be precluded Further research on this point after the filing of a criminal claim when the details of the allegations are known may be productive Also it may be worthwhile to look for regulatory statutes that consider language similar to that in the Federal Power Act to determine if preemptionprimary jurisdiction case law exists in

Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis We believe that the production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges Generally speaking the Enron Entities propose to produce documents for year as noted below We also understand that the Commission will be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production Enron Energy Services Operations Inc is the parent of Enron Energy Services Inc and does not have operating authority or engage in wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy Thus the documents offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy Services Inc but we have designated them both as EES We also do not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests through Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities businesses the burden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April is significant The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of their current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization To the extent that the Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods they will also make those available One Enron Entity Portland General has published books on its corporate history If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it With respect to the other Enron Entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October Requests and The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers We believe this information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the staffs purposes FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI EES and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data the Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which information includes economic data We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests and For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions For Portland General the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as Portland General owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand As a result we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited Nevertheless Portland General proposes to provide for year electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant as discussed below We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the California market At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests and We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant transaction data for year in California and outside of California and Real Time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or a sale Because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMIs customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES confidentiality obligations to those customers We anticipate producing the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order In addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission If you have any questions or comments about our proposal please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day or myself Brobeck Phleger Harrison LLP Gary Fergus

Gary S Sent Monday May PM To Michael L Kirby Email Cc Molland Michael E Smith Amanda D Subject Draft Research Memorandum on Senator Dunn Issues Mike Here is the draft research memo that Amanda prepared on some of the questions surrounding Senator Dunns investigation some of this you saw before Legislative Committee Subpoena Power Government Code Section provides that a subpoena requiring the attendance of any witness before the Senate Assembly or a committee may be issued by the President of the Senate Speaker of the Assembly or the chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the witness is desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee of the respective house There is a relative dearth of case law interpreting Govt Code et seq and the Govt Code reporters cross reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections on issuance of subpoenas CCP et seq Therefore it is possible that the provisions of both the Govt Code and the CCP will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena issued by a legislative committee Govt Code Section provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it a states whether the proceeding is before the Senate Assembly or a committee b is addressed to the witness presumably the custodian of records when documents are sought c requires the attendance of the witness at a time and place certain and d is signed by the President of the Senate Speaker of the Assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the witness is desired If the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or neglects or refuses to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books papers or document sin his possession or under his control he has committed a contempt Govt Code Section If the contempt is committed while the Legislature is in session Govt Code Section provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the Senate or Assembly for such action as may be deemed necessary by the Senate or Assembly If the Legislature is not in session the superior court in and for the county in which any inquiry investigation hearing or proceeding is held may compel the production of books papers documents and accounts as required by the subpoena issued by the committee on the filing by the committee of a petition to the court asking that the witness be so compelled Govt Code Section provides that any witness neglecting or refusing to attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested It is unclear how this provision would or whether it could be applied to a subpoena issued to the custodian of records of a nonresident company Motion to Quash Subpoena California courts have held under CCP Section that a motion to quash is the procedurally appropriate method of testing the validity of a subpoena duces tecum See eg People ex rel Dept of Public Works v Younger CalAppd My research has revealed no case in which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has been challenged by a motion to quash but as noted above there appear to be only a very few cases interpreting Govt Code et seq Therefore it appears that a superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a subpoena issued by a legislative committee assuming that we want to take the risk of state court jurisdiction In one early case the Court of Appeal held that the contempt order and accompanying affidavit issued by the Court upon the request of a Senate Committee were fatally defective Ex Parte McLain CalAppd In McLain the Senate Interim Committee on Social Welfare served upon Mr McLain the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of a corporation a subpoena calling for the production of various books papers and documents Mr McLain appeared before the committee but refused to answer questions or produce the documents Upon representation of the Committee the Superior Court issued an order directing Mr McLain to produce the documents Mr McLain again appeared before the Committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point an affidavit was filed in Superior Court stating That based upon evidence in its possession the said Senate Interim Committee has determined that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No and That each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and that the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No The Superior Court found Mr McLain guilty of contempt and ordered him committed to the sheriff until he produced the records The Court of Appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for In cases of constructive contempt as is this not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the offense McLain at This holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting CCP which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege material facts rather than conclusory statements See eg Grannis v Board of Medical Examiners CalAppd However cases interpreting CCP also require the subpoena to demonstrate a level of specificity materiality and relevance to be held proper See eg Pacific Auto Ins Co v Superior Court CalAppd It is unclear whether subpoenas issued by legislative committees are held to this same standard What is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued against the Enron custodian of records an outofstate resident intended to affect the production of outofstate Enron documents Here are the threshold questions A Since we have found so few cases interpreting Govt Code Section to what extent would a legislative committee subpoena be governed by the same procedural and substantive rules as a subpoena issued in a pending civil state court action B Would a court determining the validity of a legislative committee subpoena make reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections governing subpoenas generally ie CCP et seq or those governing deposition subpoenas ie CCP et seq This is a tossup and the answer may well be both The Government Code reporter sections on legislative subpoenas cross references to CCP et seq subpoenas generally However the deposition subpoena provisions CCP et seq more closely resemble the discovery process that the Senator seems to be undertaking Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq CCP is entitled Residency requirements for attendance of witnesses and provides that A witness including a witness specified in subdivision b of Section is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court judge justice or any other officer unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service There is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by Section Section provides when a subpoena duchess mecum is served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided in Article commencing with Section of Chapter of Division of the Evidence Code and his personal attendance is not required by the terms of the subpoena Section shall not apply Evade Code lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records where the business is neither a party nor the place where any cause of action is alleged to have arisen On commentator noted the following with respect to CCP The rule limiting subpoenas to California residents CCP does not apply to subpoenas duchess mecum served on custodians of records unless their personal attendance is required See CCP Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London CalAppth fn Thus a nonresident custodian of business records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon him or her while present in California by producing the records in accordance with Cal Evid Code delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court clerk However CCP probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to California jurisdiction Otherwise there would be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident See Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London supra Werner Fairbanks Epstein Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Trials at Moreover in one unpublished case Allee v King CalAppd the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to produce original outofstate documents at trial In so holding the court stated that even though King apparently voluntarily attended the trial his presence does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the outofstate documents Although section uses the word witness and does not refer to documents it has long been presumed under common law that documents in other states are outside the courts territorial jurisdiction so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence instead of originals See eg Heinz v Heinz CalAppd Pd and cases cited therein The recognition that outofstate documents are not subject to the courts process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that absent a statute properly conferring broader powers the extent of a states subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders See CJS Witnesses S p S p S p AmJurd Witnesses S p S p However the Allee court notes that the stateborder limitation on subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are outofstate Therefore even under Allee if a subpoena was issued to a California Enron entity that possessed responsive documents that Enron entity may be obligated to respond See Boal v Price Waterhouse Co CalAppd Therefore if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an outofstate officer of Enron Enron has a very good argument that that witness is not obligated to attend under CCP It also seems probable that under Amoco and Allele cited above if a subpoena is served on an Enron custodian of records who is employed by a nonCalifornia Enron entity the subpoena may be invalid However if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian of records or someone similarly situated who is employed by an Enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in California that Enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents It is an open question whether that custodian of records employed by an Enron entity in California would only be required to produce the Enron documents in the possession of the Enron California entity or whether that persons obligation would extend further to produce outof state documents ie documents from nonCalifornia Enron entities This question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the CCP statutory scheme see below but is still open Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq Additional threshold question If the legislative subpoena was treated as a deposition subpoena would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat Enron as a party or as a nonparty The rules governing the reach of discovery in California are obviously different for the two The deposition of a party or partyaffiliated witness may be noticed without a subpoena for a place within miles of the witness residence It is unclear how a court would resolve this issue After all if a court was resolving the issue at all an Enron entity will have appeared before it and would be a party However it seems moderately more likely that the court would treat Enrons obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was served with a nonparty subpoena There are three types of deposition subpoena a testimony only subpoena requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness a business records subpoena requires only the production of business records and a records and testimony subpoena requires both also formerly called subpoena duces tecum The second of these is the most relevant to Enron The attendance of an non party outofstate witness or the production of documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the deposition is to be taken CCP b Specifically CCP b provides If the deponent is not a party to the action or an officer director managing agent or employee of a party a party serving a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures required and available under the laws of the state territory or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to attend and to testify as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection copying and any related activity Some states issue subpoenas routinely some require a showing of materiality or relevancy and some require a commission from the court where the action is pending This question will depend on the law of the state when the custodian of records resides Regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an instate custodian of records would compel the production of outofstate documents Weil Brown Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Before Trial at notes It is unclear whether service of a business records subpoena on a nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records located outside the state CCP d requires that the subpoena be directed to the records custodian or someone authorized to certify the records Whether custodian requires actual custody of the records is unclear If it does serving an officer or agent in California would not compel production of business records located elsewhere The result is different where a records and testimony subpoena is used That procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party not merely in his or her custody If the State of California files civil suit against Enron to obtain discovery of the requested documents does the fact that the State is the plaintiff rather than a private party affect Enrons prospects for removal of the suit to federal court If the action filed by the State of California presents a federal question then under the rationale of the court in People of the State of California v Steelcase Inc CD Cal FSupp the case should be removable to federal court In People of the State of California v Steelcase Inc CD Cal FSupp the District Attorney of the County of Los Angeles brought suit alleging violations of the Cartwright Act and the Unfair Competition Statutes Cal Bus Prof Code and The District Court found that although the district attorney is only allowed to prosecute Cartwright Act violations on behalf of the county or public agencies located in the county the unfair competition statutes expressly provide that suit be brought in the name of the people of the State of California Id at Therefore for the purposes of the Unfair Competition Claims the Court found that the State of California was the real party in interest The Court then found that for diversity purposes a state is not a citizen of itself Therefore it cannot sue or be sued in a diversity action Id Specifically the Court found that even assuming arguendo that defendant is correct that the County of Los Angeles is the real party in interest and the proper party in the Cartwright Act claim diversity jurisdiction does not lie because under long established teaching there must be complete diversity ie all plaintiffs must be diverse from defendant Eg Strawbridge v Curtiss US Cranch LEd Here there cannot be complete diversity because to repeat the State of California is not a citizen of any state Id that independent of its failure to meet the complete diversity test the court lacks jurisdiction over this case because of the bar of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution The Eleventh Amendment is a grant of sovereign immunity to a state against suit in federal court It is in the nature of a jurisdictional bar Defendant relying on the literal wording of the Eleventh Amendment contends that this is not a suit against one of the United States because the State is the plaintiff However since the immunity granted by the Eleventh Amendment is an immunity from being made an involuntary party to an action in federal court it should apply equally to the case where the state is a plaintiff in an action commenced in state court and the action is removed to federal court by the defendant Id internal citations removed However the Court noted that where removal is predicated on federal question jurisdiction removal is permitted even where a nonremovable claim is joined with the removable claim Id If a criminal case price gouging etc is brought against Enron is there any theory preemption primary jurisdiction or double jeopardy which would allow that criminal proceeding to be dismissed stayed or removed given the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act Our preliminary research shows that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the Federal Power Act specifically Generally in one case concerning a District Court order staying criminal action involving allegations of conspiracy and fraud against a defense contractor pending the District Courts referral of various questions regarding the case to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals the Ninth Circuit has said Our concern with the district courts stay and referral is heightened by the fact that this action is a criminal prosecution While it is true that the primary jurisdiction doctrine has been applied in criminal cases see United States v Pacific A Ry Navigation Co US United States v Yellow Freight Sys th Cir Fd its use clearly interferes with the governments authority to prosecute criminal cases We said in a related context We approach the interpretation of the statute with a presumption against a congressional intention to limit the power of the Attorney General to prosecute offenses under the criminal laws of the United States In general the conduct of federal criminal litigation is an executive function within the exclusive prerogative of the Attorney General In re Subpoena of Persico Fd d Cir quoting United States v Cox Fd th Cir Wisdom J concurring Congress may limit or reassign the prosecutorial responsibility See Case v Bowles US SCt LEd Nader v Saxbe USAppDC Fd n DCCir FTC v Guignon Fd th Cir But to graft such an exception upon the criminal law would require a clear and unambiguous expression of the legislative will United States v Morgan US SCt LEd United States v International Union of Operating Engineers Local Fd th Cir cert denied US SCt LEdd United States v General Dynamics Corp th Cir Fd The General Dynamics Court went on to say that only where an issue unambiguously requires initial agency determination under the primary jurisdiction doctrine and the referring court has the authority to review the agencys order can the agencys regulatory interests be required or allowed to subordinate the governments authority to prosecute criminal offenses Id In another context the Ninth Circuit held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies before the Federal Election Commission was not a prerequisite to indictment under the Federal Election Campaign Act neither the language nor the legislative history of the Act provides the kind of clear and unambiguous expression of legislative will necessary to support a holding that Congress sought to alter the traditionally broad scope of the Attorney Generals prosecutorial discretion by requiring initial administrative screening of alleged violations of the Act On the contrary the language and legislative history indicates that while centralizing and strengthening the authority of the FERC to enforce the Act administratively and by civil proceedings Congress intended to leave undisturbed the Justice Departments authority to prosecute criminally a narrow range of aggravated offenses United States v International Union of Operating Engineers Local Fd See also In re Grand Jury Investigation of Shipping Industry DDC FSupp though the doctrine of primary jurisdiction may be applied to both civil and to criminal actions it is more forceful in the civil regulatory type actions than in criminal actions for in the latter actions the violations of other federal statutes may more often be involved and the regulatory scheme less affected Therefore it seems clear that it will be difficult to invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to dismiss or stay criminal proceedings against Enron especially since the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act are relatively limited In addition at least one court has held in the civil context that the Federal Power Act was not designed to shift the forum for the trial of antitrust questions affecting power companies from the District Courts to the Power Commission FERCs predecessor Pennsylvania Water Power Co v Consolidated Gas Electric Light Power Co th Cir Fd I have not been able to find any case directly on point which invokes double jeopardy type arguments In other words if there are possible criminal penalties under the Federal Power Act and the same conduct is at issue that was examined by FERC would State law criminal charges based upon the same conduct be precluded Further research on this point after the filing of a criminal claim when the details of the allegations are known may be productive Also it may be worthwhile to look for regulatory statutes that consider language similar to that in the Federal Power Act to determine if preemptionprimary jurisdiction case law exists in

Peter Sent Wednesday May PM To Fergus Gary S Subject FW Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High Original Message From Fergus Gary S Sent Monday October AM To Meringolo Peter Subject FW Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High FYI Thanks Gary Original Message From Fergus Gary S Sent Friday October PM To Cc MBD Subject Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis We believe that the production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges Generally speaking the Enron Entities propose to produce documents for year as noted below We also understand that the Commission will be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production Enron Energy Services Operations Inc is the parent of Enron Energy Services Inc and does not have operating authority or engage in wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy Thus the documents offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy Services Inc but we have designated them both as EES We also do not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests through Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities businesses the burden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April is significant The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of their current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization To the extent that the Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods they will also make those available One Enron Entity Portland General has published books on its corporate history If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it With respect to the other Enron Entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October Requests and The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers We believe this information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the staffs purposes FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI EES and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data the Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which information includes economic data We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests and For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions For Portland General the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as Portland General owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand As a result we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited Nevertheless Portland General proposes to provide for year electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant as discussed below We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the California market At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests and We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant transaction data for year in California and outside of California and Real Time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or a sale Because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMIs customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES confidentiality obligations to those customers We anticipate producing the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order In addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission If you have any questions or comments about our proposal please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day or myself

could remove a criminal case against Enron to federal court It is not as promising as we first thought Thanks Gary Original Message From Smith Amanda D Sent Thursday May PM To Fergus Gary S Cc Molland Michael E Meringolo Peter Subject Enron Response to Criminal Charges Gary Our earlier preliminary research reflected the fact that although it will likely be difficult it may be possible under the primary jurisdiction doctrine to refer criminal charges to FERC given the criminal penalty provisions of the Federal Power Act However as it becomes more clear that if criminal charges are to be filed they will be filed in California it is necessary to revisit and expand this earlier research We noted earlier that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the Federal Power Act specifically Based on this we concluded that it may be possible if difficult to argue that criminal charges should be referred to FERC under the primary jurisdiction doctrine An expansion of this research reveals that this potential for referral appears to only be applicable to federal criminal charges State criminal charges are not removable under USC Section which provides that except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction may be removed by the defendant or the defendants to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending Moreover our research has revealed no case in which state criminal charges were referred directly to any federal regulatory agency However our research has revealed another alternative to removal or referral of criminal charges See generally Sprint Corp v Evans MD Al FSupp Sprint Corp v Evans MD Al FSupp In the Attorney General of Alabama began an investigation of Sprint Corporation an international telecommunications company acting as a common carrier within the meaning of the federal Communications Act Sprint among other things provided a service to subscribers pursuant to tariffs filed with the FCC To use these numbers a caller places a call through a local telephone company who connects the call to a long distance carrier such as Sprint who generally then connected the call to the subscribers local telephone number In February Sprint received a subpoena from the Montgomery County Grand Jury commanding it to appear and produce all records relating to the service Sprint produced the documents and learned that it was under investigation for violation of Alabamas obscenity laws in connection with allegedly obscene content distributed over telephone lines In March Sprint filed a motion for a temporary restraining order TRO and a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Alabama Attorney General from pursuing a criminal indictment against Sprint for violation of the obscenity law Sprint maintained enforcement of the antiobscenity law would interfere with federal statutory rights because regulation of interstate communications is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the FCC At the TRO hearing the Attorney General could not testify that the prosecution was not imminent and therefore the court issued the TRO Later in March the Court decided Sprints motion for a preliminary injunction Sprint Corp v Evans MD Al FSupp At the hearing on this motion counsel for the Attorney General stated that the Attorney Generals position regarding Sprints criminal liability under the obscenity statute related to the its obligations under that law when a telephone customer complains that a subscribers message is offensive According to counsel if a customer complains Sprint is obligated to either report the complaint to a prosecuting attorney or begin a declaratory judgment action against the subscriber The District Court granted the preliminary injunction The court held that under the relevant Eleventh Circuit test for determining whether a preliminary injunction should issue the movant must show a substantial likelihood that she will ultimately prevail on the merits that she will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party and that if issued the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest Sprint FSupp at Before the Court considered the first element of this test the Court addressed the contention that the District Court had no jurisdiction The Court held that the Supreme Court however has held that federal courts have federalquestion jurisdiction under USCA S to entertain suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal statutory rights The Court then held that there was a substantial likelihood that Sprint would prevail on the merits because to the extent that the Alabama antiobscenity statute attempts to impose reporting requirements on communications by common carriers it is interstate in nature and preempted by federal law The statute is being used as a mechanism to impose new reporting requirements on common carriers with regard to their service Currently under federal law common carriers do not have an affirmative obligation to investigate whether their facilities are being used by customers for a lawful purpose Importantly the Court did not reach the question whether the Communications Act preempts all Alabama laws imposing liability for conduct of common carriers in the area of obscenity The Court also rejected the Attorney Generals argument that a Younger abstention was necessary The Court disposed of the last three parts of the preliminary injunction test easily First the Court held that irreparable harm would result because an indictment against Sprint would cause great harm to its business reputation and would jeopardize its status as a government contractor Second the Court held that the potential harm to Sprint outweighed the potential harm to the Attorney General because although the Attorney General relies on a state statute directed at the prosecution of the distribution of obscene matter the Attorney General really seeks to impose interstate reporting requirements on common carriersin other words the generic proceeding at issue is the regulation of interstate telecommunications by common carriers outside the context of the distribution of obscene matter The Attorney General clearly has no interest in such interstate regulation Third the Court held that the preliminary injunction serves the public interest by ensuring that the national interest in fulfilling the goals of the Federal Communications Act Sprint FSupp at In a separate decision almost a year later the District Court granted in part Sprints motion to refer certain issues to the FCC under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction Sprint FSupp at Prior to this motion the Alabama Attorney General changed its allegations regarding the illegality of Sprints conduct under the obscenity law now alleging that Sprint was not criminally liable because of a failure to report but because of a aiding and abetting theory The District Court held in brief that referral to FCC under primary jurisdiction doctrine was warranted with regard to question of whether common carriers consistent with Communications Act may refuse to carry information providers program transmitted as service if program contains sexually explicit information that has not been adjudicated obscene and referral to FCC was not warranted with respect to question of whether attempted criminal prosecution of interstate common carrier under states antiobscenity laws for knowingly transmitting potentially obscene or obscene telephone communications through its interstate facilities is preempted by Communications Act Sprint FSupp at The Court then ordered that the record of the case be transmitted to the FCC that the preliminary injunction remain in effect and that all motions would be denied without prejudice until after the FCC rendered its decision Obviously no analysis of the criminal charges against Enron can yet be made but there is a significant chance that Enron may be able to cast any criminal charges filed by the California Attorney General as regulatory in nature Moreover given relative lack of effect the Alabama Attorney Generals change in position in the middle of the Sprint case the regulatory aspect of the charges may not be as important as it may seem in the first Sprint holding on the preliminary injunction Please let me know if you would like me to pursue this further My research has not yet revealed any case that is factually similar to the Sprint case This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain
