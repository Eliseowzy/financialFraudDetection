Weather Archives IMAGE Subscribe to the print Houston Chronicle SubscribersADVANTAGE To contact us Email Office phone Address Texas Ave Houston Texas Dec Volume Letter from the editor Were always tinkering with one area of the site or another trying to make it better This week weve made some rather significant changes to the Deaths page on the site And were working on several more For starters weve combined the pages with the news articles and the local death notices from the Classifieds section into a single page This way you get to all of the daily information we have all at once In addition to the obituaries and death notices weve added links to additional resources both for genealogical purposes and for those needing to make plans for a funeral Well add more links in this area as they become available For instance theres a link for an online search of birth and death records for Harris County now but not for the City of Houston or for the State of Texas Those latter two governmental units dont provide online searches of their records yet When they do well add the links And yes we are working to include Mic Barnettes Saturday column on genealogy from the newspaper The page still has a search box for the local death notices and other funerary categories from the Classifieds section but we dont think you will need it very often We are listing all of the local notices being published each day on the page now and weve included links on the left side navigation of the page for notices from the entire week just passed Theres still a lot of hand work and construction going on here so please be patient with us We dont have a real search engine in this area yet so we are going to try to rearrange the file by hand each morning so the notices are listed in alphabetical order Occasionally other tasks will push this work back and it will not happen as early as either of us would like which is why we also are working on a routine to make the computers do this job Another ongoing programming task for this page is to develop a true archives database and search for the local notices we have saved by hand online going back to October of However until this task is completed you can search for past notices through a twostep precess We have a surname index for all of the death notices in the Chronicles archives system so you can use the archives gateway to determine whether or not a notice was published for a particular individual and when Once knowing the date the notice was published you can see if we saved it online by using a special URL contentchronicledeathsYYMMDDdeathshtml where YY is a twodigit year like etc MM is a twodigit month like etc and DD is a twodigit date like etc We know this is cumbersome which is why we are working on a better way of doing it but this will work to get to the past notices we do have until then Thanks for visiting and please party carefully so we dont find your name on the new Deaths page this season Mike Read Editor ProTem HoustonChroniclecom News Whats New at HoustonChroniclecom Shopping Online It only seems that shopping is the reason for the season at this time of year We try to a measure of balance on both our Holidays and Religion pages but this is the major shopping period of every year But we would be remiss if we didnt try to do our part to help keep the economy moving along so we would like to take this opportunity to point out the Chronicle eshops area of the site in case you havent looked it over before Chronicle eshops is a partnership with Point Shop on Houston Chroniclecom Its an online shopping area offering merchandise from businesses throughout the country quickly and reliably available for delivery before Christmas right from the convenience of your Web browser Election Without End Yes another week is gone and the Florida vote that will determine who the next president will be still is up in the air Right now were all waiting on a US Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Monday on whether or not to allow a recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court So far the George W Bush organization has been successful in fighting off vote recounts that might show that Al Gore won the Florida vote and time may now be the Bush campaigns strongest argument With each passing day the time required for a manual recount gets squeezed tighter and tighter Also the Florida Legislature will be meeting this week to consider naming its own slate of delegates which inevitably would be pledged to Bush since the Florida Legislature is overwhelmingly controlled by Republicans If Bush gets the Florida electors he will win the presidency by two votes in the Electoral College Were as confused as anybody but well keep posting the latest developments
