latest on San Francisco junior college linebacker Lance Mitchells visit to Norman LANCE MITCHELL MLB SAN FRANCISCO CC CALIFORNIA JH How did your visit to OU this weekend go LM Oklahoma was real good and I had a great time Oklahoma has a need for linebackers and that is important to me The people were great and the town was super Being from LA many people told me that I wouldnt like a small town like Norman but that wasnt true Norman seems to be a great town and a great town that I could live in My host was Roy Williams and he is a great guy He showed us a little Cali love JH What did you think of the OU defense LM I loved the defensive scheme I loved the people that were on the field that would be back if I went to Oklahoma I liked the coaches and how they went about their business I think I would fit in real well with them JH What did you think of the way OU plays its middle linebacker LM It is designed for that player in the middle to make the plays Either you do or you dont but you have every opportunity to make the plays JH Roy Williams was the host how did you enjoy our visit with him LM Roy was pretty depressed about the game but I was pretty mad to We went to a party that night and just hung out We didnt do all that much but we had a great time because he was such a great guy and all the players we met were super Roy is a super person and so are the rest of the guys as well JH Did you come close to committing to OU LM I promised my mom I wouldnt commit and I didnt but I really enjoyed the visit However if signing day was tomorrow I would sign with OU OU is out in front of the schools that I have visited thus far I was supposed to visit Texas this weekend but that changed because they will play for the Big title However I dont know if I am going to visit Texas or not because I am finding out they have a lot more depth and commitments than they have been telling me about I will visit Florida on December th JH What did you think of the game LM Being a fellow football player I can tell when the better team isnt winning That is what happened Saturday The offense never really got it going and that happens sometimes You cant leave your defense on the field for the whole game If OU played them times I am not sure OU wouldnt win the next ten I my opinion OU played a bunch of cheerleaders and lost but it wont happen again JH What did you think of the atmosphere LM Its was great and I would love to play in front of that JH Would it take a super visit from one of the teams ahead for you not to come to OU LM I am a shy guy yet I had so much fun there The people were just so nice to me and made me relax and be myself That is so important to me and OU has that naturally cant see anybody beating OU at this point RECRUITING Jackson enjoys visit to Norman By James Hale Date Nov Junior college linebacker Pasha Jackson talks about his trip to Norman this weekend PASHA JACKSON SLB SAN FRANCISCO CC CALIFORNIA JH How was your trip to OU PJ The trip was excellent even though they had a tough game The chemistry between players and coaches was excellent I loved everything about the trip except for the game because I was wanting Oklahoma to win I really enjoyed watching Coach Brent Venables because he is a very intense positive guy and I like that I could tell he is a great coach which means a lot to me because I will be spending most of my time with him JH Did Lance like the trip as well PJ Lance and I talked about the trip all the way back on the plane He had nothing but positive things to say about OU as well We both feel that we both can see nothing but positives about both us going to OU JH Did you almost commit to OU on the trip PJ OU made committing more tempting that any other visit thus far We were close to committing but I feel I need to take my other visits so that I know for sure who my best school is going to be I am not committing but OU is looking pretty good Without question they are the best school that we have visited thus far JH What did you think of the OU defense PJ I like OUs defense I feel I would fit in at the SLB position when they are in their standard defense but I can also play in their nickel Because I can play in the nickel and have a linebacker type body on the field that would help their run support which is important in a conference like the Big It would enhance the defense because I am a bigger and stronger player yet I can easily help in pass coverage JH What did you think of Norman PJ A lot of my people are from Louisiana and the surrounding area so I know about that part of the country Granted Norman is not like Los Angeles but it is not small town either You can have a lot of fun in Norman and have a good quality of life The people are real down to earth and are very nice When Lance and I went to your radio show the people were so down to earth that it touched us because they were so kind to two total strangers I could easily live in Norman JH What is up next for you in recruiting PJ I am going to visit my next two schools which are Arizona and South Carolina but going into those visits OU is way out in front BASKETBALL RECRUITING Kevin Bookout update By James Hale Date Nov The latest on sixfootseven Stroud power forward Kevin Bookout KEVIN BOOKOUT STROUD OKLAHOMA There is still nothing official to report on whether Bookout signed with OU or not Bookout told me tonight he will make an official statement on the subject Wednesday or Thursday Here are my thoughts from what I have been able to gather as facts I have no doubts that Bookout is going to be a Sooner The question is in which sport basketball or track or both I believe that Bookout has singed with the OU basketball program but what I dont know is if OU has turned in the papers or not The reason that I am not sure if the papers are in or not is because Bookout is struggling with the question of just competing in track or playing both basketball and track in college Plus there has been no official announcement If OU never turns in the papers then it is just like he didnt sign If Bookout just decides to pursue track and field at OU then he needs to sign a scholarship with the OU track program because you must participate with the program you sign with your freshman season If he is going to play both sports at OU then OU hoops will turn in those scholarship papers if they can or they will resign him in the spring The USA Olympic committee is putting a lot of pressure on Bookout to just compete in track and field They dont care if he goes to OU or not but they want him to just concentrate on the shot and discus They certainly have Bookouts ear at the moment However he has told the OU basketball coaches several times over the past few days that he wants to play basketball and then he talks to USA Track and gets confused I believe when this is all said and done that Bookout will play both sports at OU It may mean that he has to resign with OU hoops again in the spring but then again maybe the fact he has already signed in the fall will count in some way So this isnt totally in the books yet except that I know Bookout is going to OU I just dont know if it is to play both basketball and trackandfield or just participate in track
