<12822017.1075859277766.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,michael@pnge.psu.edu,2001-11-29 11:14:33,Summary of ProgressDear Larry It was good hearing from you a few days ago We are wrapping up a progress report on the project but I can tell you briefly what we have accomplished so far We have finished the PCB model developmentmodification to incorporate most of the main ideas that we talked about when you John and your crew visited us Specifically we have been able to extend the model significantly to include flow regime impact on cleanup efficiency and the amount of solvent that will be required We have looked at the issue of contact time and contact area These two and some of the other salient issues turned out to be more challenging to handle than we had originally anticipated but we have now nailed them In fact the new program finally worked well and debugged only about weeks ago Since then we have been doing shakedown testing and all is well so far The results are exciting as you would see in the report There are two tasks that we would now embark on Now that the model has all the principal mechanisms incorporated we are now planning a comprehensive production runs where we will give you cleanup options etc with critical evaluations of those That will probably take us until the end of January This is where I will need to talk to you very often to determine what options make most sense to run so that we do not just run millions of options Along this line we will need another nocost extension letter from you so as to continue the work beyond December We can talk about how long if you want so as to determine what you would really like to be the concluding point So I will call you after sending the report which should be by Monday next week Thanks and best regards Michael Michael A Adewumi PhD Professor Chair of Graduate Program in Petroleum Natural Gas Engineering Quentin E and Louis L Wood University Endowed Fellow The Pennsylvania State University Hosler Building University Park PA Tel Fax Email
