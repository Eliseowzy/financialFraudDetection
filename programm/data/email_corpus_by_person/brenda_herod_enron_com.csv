NOT to have dinner but if necessary we will I suggest each of you to make arrangements to stay as late as needed to ensure we reach a quality work product Our agenda Review of ground rules and responsibilities of the committee Each of you will provide a general business assessment of your team HR challenges should be identified along with needed skill sets gap analysis and succession planning The template below should be used for the format I am not interested in discussing the business goals but you probably need to think through these in order to discuss the assessments that we will want to discuss as a group Review and discussion of exempt employees Each will be categorized into the six descriptors used in the feedback process I am expecting each of you to have a listing of accomplishments from your employees along with factual feedback and observations which will allow you to place your employees into appropriate categories I would like to stress that the data to sustantiate the performance descriptor should be factual and documented The focus of employee discussions must be on each employees individual contribution towards accomplishing our business goals We must safeguard our discussions from he said she said periferal distractors and focus on the work product Promotion candidates discussion Once again the PRC process is a valued process at Enron Each of you have been through it so you understand the importance of confidentiality Additionally the Committee will be required to reach an unanimous vote Please come to the meeting with your Enron hat on not your individual group hat Our people are critical to our business Therefore it is important for us to be honest when evaluating our staff We must identify our stengths and weaknesses and work towards strengthening our people to ensure the very best business service we can provide What this means is that we should provide our employees with the very best constructive feedback possible In some cases you may be providing a tough message but it is our responsibility and obligation to ensure that each employee fully understands expectations where they are on point and where they are NOT on point of meeting these expectations so that they can have the next six months to build needed skill sets andor correct behaviors This is your obligation as their immediate supervisor If you have any questions concerns or issues you would like to talk about prior to the meeting on Tuesday please contact me or Hector In advance I appreciate your time energy and professionalism in this process

sustantiate the performance descriptor should be factual and documented The focus of employee discussions must be on each employees individual contribution towards accomplishing our business goals We must safeguard our discussions from he said she said periferal distractors and focus on the work product Promotion candidates discussion Once again the PRC process is a valued process at Enron Each of you have been through it so you understand the importance of confidentiality Additionally the Committee will be required to reach an unanimous vote Please come to the meeting with your Enron hat on not your individual group hat Our people are critical to our business Therefore it is important for us to be honest when evaluating our staff We must identify our stengths and weaknesses and work towards strengthening our people to ensure the very best business service we can provide What this means is that we should provide our employees with the very best constructive feedback possible In some cases you may be providing a tough message but it is our responsibility and obligation to ensure that each employee fully understands expectations where they are on point and where they are NOT on point of meeting these expectations so that they can have the next six months to build needed skill sets andor correct behaviors This is your obligation as their immediate supervisor If you have any questions concerns or issues you would like to talk about prior to the meeting on Tuesday please contact me or Hector In advance I appreciate your time energy and professionalism in this process

responsibilities of the committee Each of you will provide a general business assessment of your team HR challenges should be identified along with needed skill sets gap analysis and succession planning The template below should be used for the format I am not interested in discussing the business goals but you probably need to think through these in order to discuss the assessments that we will want to discuss as a group Review and discussion of exempt employees Each will be categorized into the six descriptors used in the feedback process I am expecting each of you to have a listing of accomplishments from your employees along with factual feedback and observations which will allow you to place your employees into appropriate categories I would like to stress that the data to sustantiate the performance descriptor should be factual and documented The focus of employee discussions must be on each employees individual contribution towards accomplishing our business goals We must safeguard our discussions from he said she said periferal distractors and focus on the work product Promotion candidates discussion Once again the PRC process is a valued process at Enron Each of you have been through it so you understand the importance of confidentiality Additionally the Committee will be required to reach an unanimous vote Please come to the meeting with your Enron hat on not your individual group hat Our people are critical to our business Therefore it is important for us to be honest when evaluating our staff We must identify our stengths and weaknesses and work towards strengthening our people to ensure the very best business service we can provide What this means is that we should provide our employees with the very best constructive feedback possible In some cases you may be providing a tough message but it is our responsibility and obligation to ensure that each employee fully understands expectations where they are on point and where they are NOT on point of meeting these expectations so that they can have the next six months to build needed skill sets andor correct behaviors This is your obligation as their immediate supervisor If you have any questions concerns or issues you would like to talk about prior to the meeting on Tuesday please contact me or Hector In advance I appreciate your time energy and professionalism in this process

week there seems to be several similarities between the Metals business and industrial markets I believe the blueprint that is forthcoming will provide more insight that will be helpful to you all We would love to share this with you and also discuss your system direction There may be some opportunities for us to work together on the development I would like to have a discussion to talk about next steps and believe Andy is planning to initiate this after he returns from holiday Let me know if you have some other ideas Im sorry that we didnt have a chance to get together last week while I was in London My trip was very short and I kept missing you when I went to your desk Ill plan some time with you when Im there next time Mike Jordan AM To Brenda F CT cc Sally CT Subject Re Metals Brenda It strikes me that the planning documentation could be enormously useful to us in backtesting our existing processes and determining any potential overlaps Is there any obstacle to access to this information Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Brenda F Herod To Andrew CT cc Mike CT Paul CT John CT Roy CT Michael E CT Kristen J CT Yvette G NRON Jill nronXgate Delmar nronXgate Daniel nronXgate Subject Re Metals Andy Thanks so much for your message I had you on my To Do list today to followup from our conversation last week I appreciate your responses and will followup as needed Just to recap EIMs current inititives PriceWaterhouseCoopers PWC was engaged in to develop a business plan for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical business In AA was engaged to develop a Blueprint of EIM major processes Deal Execution Deal Capture Risk Management Logistics Settlements and Financial Reporting down to level processes The initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the Blueprint a gap analysis of Enron systems to business needs and recommended systems A complete roadmap should be laid out with a months months months and months timeline The plan addresses tactical also Our overall objective Build an infrastructure people processes and systems that is scalable and supports the trading business of EIM The current industries are Forest Products and Steel However additional industries may be added The targeted infrastructure would require little change to support new industries The delieverable is expected by the end of Wed be happy to visit with you all video conference or Houston to give you more information Let me know how to proceed Thanks again for your time Since I wasnt able to attend the Controllers Conference last Im glad I got to meet you last week Stay in touch Brenda To Brenda F CT cc Mike CT Paul CT Subject Metals Brenda As discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality between Enron Metals and EIM that should allow leverage off common goals In particular I promised info on a few areas Project Q assessment A lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to Enron Metals being to do with interfaces with our AS ysstem however high level issues which formed part of the decision to not develop this for Enron metals were Q is over specified for metals Traffic logistics for metals is less complex than oil coal Metals process tends towards BuyStoreSell whereas for liquids the storage is not as prevelant Metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is shipbarge Inventory Controls Again the reports produced here have been very specific to Enron Metals Paul Wallace a manager in the coordination function is working extensively on developing the controls in this area I would suggest that you contact Paul directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in general Funding of inventory We have a structured finance facility here in London The deal is specific to Enron Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are the base index for all the positions placed in the facility If structured financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either David Tregar Metals Commercial or Bill Appleby Global Finance as an intro to the issues faced Curve Management Process The markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location EG for Copper this means we have a grid with brand groups and sets of port groups for europe for the US and for the Far East The maintaince price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points ie price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote Re recruitment of paper traders I havent been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David Rosenblum one of the metals traders in Chicago is a trader of recylced paper Ill keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London Id appreciate same for EIM Regards Andy

excellent example of out proactivity and mitigation of operational risk As indicated below once we learned of financial difficulties we pulled together a team which included Commercial to evaluate next steps The team went to Chicago and met with the owner of the reload facility business He had a financial representative present and our concerns were validated The owner of the business currently leases the facility from the railroad and he has not paid his lease in or months Additionally he has not filed federal income taxes for payroll corporate or personal business He estimates that he owes about M The facility is not fenced so our inventory of about MM is not secured He did sign a one page document prepared by Enron legal declaring that the lumber on site marked Enron was in fact ours and was not owned by his company This was a saftey measure in case the IRS came in and started seizing inventory All actions were initiated by Energy Operations personnel The team also visited another facility and in contrast to the first facility witnessed a more sophistocated operation The business is privately owned and audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers Although they would not share financial statements PWCs audit opinion was provided Additionally PWC prepares the taxes also The team made the decision to move the inventory to the new location ASAP This decision was approved by Houston Commercial and efforts began to relocate the inventory I feel very strongly that had we Energy Operations not taken the lead the Commercial team would have continued in the original facility leaving MM of inventory at risk Although they had sold about of it the inventory would not have been delivered out of the faciity until about midMarch Commercial did not have any plans for the other While we certainly dont know if the outcome would have been negative if left in the original facility we know that we certainly mitigated the potential risk Furthermore last week I established crossfunctional weekly meetings between Legal Credit Tax Financial Reporting Fundamental Analysis IT and Operations to ensure open lines of communication In the meeting I discussed this issue and everyone agreed that we needed to develop policies and procedures for warehousing facilities EIM currently has inventory in about to facilities some internationally Kent Castleman has taken the lead on this If you have

currently use in the Chicago area Premier Reload Inc I met with Romney Ruder Lumber trader Roy Lipsett Logistics and Mike Moscoso Lumber business controller this morning to gather information and develop a plan This is summarized below General Information Premier is a facility we have been using for a few months located in Franklin Park within Chicago We deliver to the facility via railcar and ship out via truck We currently have about million board feet valued at about million in the facility During the holidays we began experiencing problems with our railcars not being unloaded timely We have been pressing for information and are hearing rumors that have raised significant concerns Although Enron has not received written notification we learned today that Premier notified customers that they would not be taking in any more products Additionally we have heard that the owner Jeff Leske is closing the facility and will be going to work for another reload facility in Chicago Reserve Marine Terminal RMT We have been in negotiations with RMT for a long term arrangement and much of the information we have obtained is through our contact there In fact we have diverted recent shipments to RMT There is a rumor that Premier and or Leske may declare bankruptcy There is a rumor that Premier has been incurring switching fees with the railroad IHB and has not been paying them There is a rumor that Premier has not been paying employment taxes and there are problems with the IRS All in all there are many rumors but very few known facts Plan Met with Legal today to get advice They recommended moving the product ASAP but until moved we needed to confirm the product was marked as Enron product and that it is stored separately from other product They are drafting a contract to specify the arrangement with Premier It will be ready tomorrow Met with Credit They are not a included in the reload selection process so the financial stability of the company has not been reviewed A DB was pulled today and it confirms a lien filed by the IRS on for There is one suit pending by a trucking company in a nominal amount filed The company is owned by Leske and was started in Very little other information is available and DB did not assign a PAYDEX score Mike Moscoso and Romney Ruder are going to the premises tomorrow to gather financial information intentions of the owner and the associated timeline substantiate the inventory and get the contract signed that Legal is drafting On Friday morning Roy Lipsett will join them to meet with RMT discuss movement of the product and complete the negotiations Depending on the information gathered tomorrow we will determine next steps If we start moving the product to RMT the estimated timeline is about to days moving trucks per day total truckloads Estimated cost for the movement is about is Another would be incurred for unload fees at RMT if we cant get them to wave them About half of the product has already been sold and will be delivered over the next weeks Romney is working with customers to determine if they can take the product earlier I will keep you informed as to the next events However we need to take immediate steps to put a policy and process in place for warehousing facilities I have initiated weekly crossfunctional staff meetings Tax Legal Credit IT Logistics Fundemental Analysis Accounting etc and our first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow I will have this on the agenda and will lead the effort to develop the process Please let me know if you have any questions Brenda x

excellent example of out proactivity and mitigation of operational risk As indicated below once we learned of financial difficulties we pulled together a team which included Commercial to evaluate next steps The team went to Chicago and met with the owner of the reload facility business He had a financial representative present and our concerns were validated The owner of the business currently leases the facility from the railroad and he has not paid his lease in or months Additionally he has not filed federal income taxes for payroll corporate or personal business He estimates that he owes about M The facility is not fenced so our inventory of about MM is not secured He did sign a one page document prepared by Enron legal declaring that the lumber on site marked Enron was in fact ours and was not owned by his company This was a saftey measure in case the IRS came in and started seizing inventory All actions were initiated by Energy Operations personnel The team also visited another facility and in contrast to the first facility witnessed a more sophistocated operation The business is privately owned and audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers Although they would not share financial statements PWCs audit opinion was provided Additionally PWC prepares the taxes also The team made the decision to move the inventory to the new location ASAP This decision was approved by Houston Commercial and efforts began to relocate the inventory I feel very strongly that had we Energy Operations not taken the lead the Commercial team would have continued in the original facility leaving MM of inventory at risk Although they had sold about of it the inventory would not have been delivered out of the faciity until about midMarch Commercial did not have any plans for the other While we certainly dont know if the outcome would have been negative if left in the original facility we know that we certainly mitigated the potential risk Furthermore last week I established crossfunctional weekly meetings between Legal Credit Tax Financial Reporting Fundamental Analysis IT and Operations to ensure open lines of communication In the meeting I discussed this issue and everyone agreed that we needed to develop policies and procedures for warehousing facilities EIM currently has inventory in about to facilities some internationally Kent Castleman has taken the lead on this If you have any questions please let me know Forwarded by Brenda F HerodHOUECT on PM Enron North America Corp From Brenda F Herod PM To Raymond CT Jeffrey nronXGate cc Sally CT Kent nron Robert CT Michael E CT Romney nron Delmar nronXgate Dan APPINAcom Subject Lumber Reload Facility Premier Yesterday I was informed that there was a concern about the financial stability of one of the reload facilities we currently use in the Chicago area Premier Reload Inc I met with Romney Ruder Lumber trader Roy Lipsett Logistics and Mike Moscoso Lumber business controller this morning to gather information and develop a plan This is summarized below General Information Premier is a facility we have been using for a few months located in Franklin Park within Chicago We deliver to the facility via railcar and ship out via truck We currently have about million board feet valued at about million in the facility During the holidays we began experiencing problems with our railcars not being unloaded timely We have been pressing for information and are hearing rumors that have raised significant concerns Although Enron has not received written notification we learned today that Premier notified customers that they would not be taking in any more products Additionally we have heard that the owner Jeff Leske is closing the facility and will be going to work for another reload facility in Chicago Reserve Marine Terminal RMT We have been in negotiations with RMT for a long term arrangement and much of the information we have obtained is through our contact there In fact we have diverted recent shipments to RMT There is a rumor that Premier and or Leske may declare bankruptcy There is a rumor that Premier has been incurring switching fees with the railroad IHB and has not been paying them There is a rumor that Premier has not been paying employment taxes and there are problems with the IRS All in all there are many rumors but very few known facts Plan Met with Legal today to get advice They recommended moving the product ASAP but until moved we needed to confirm the product was marked as Enron product and that it is stored separately from other product They are drafting a contract to specify the arrangement with Premier It will be ready tomorrow Met with Credit They are not a included in the reload selection process so the financial stability of the company has not been reviewed A DB was pulled today and it confirms a lien filed by the IRS on for There is one suit pending by a trucking company in a nominal amount filed The company is owned by Leske and was started in Very little other information is available and DB did not assign a PAYDEX score Mike Moscoso and Romney Ruder are going to the premises tomorrow to gather financial information intentions of the owner and the associated timeline substantiate the inventory and get the contract signed that Legal is drafting On Friday morning Roy Lipsett will join them to meet with RMT discuss movement of the product and complete the negotiations Depending on the information gathered tomorrow we will determine next steps If we start moving the product to RMT the estimated timeline is about to days moving trucks per day total truckloads Estimated cost for the movement is about is Another would be incurred for unload fees at RMT if we cant get them to wave them About half of the product has already been sold and will be delivered over the next weeks Romney is working with customers to determine if they can take the product earlier I will keep you informed as to the next events However we need to take immediate steps to put a policy and process in place for warehousing facilities I have initiated weekly crossfunctional staff meetings Tax Legal Credit IT Logistics Fundemental Analysis Accounting etc and our first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow I will have this on the agenda and will lead the effort to develop the process Please let me know if you have any questions Brenda x

week there seems to be several similarities between the Metals business and industrial markets I believe the blueprint that is forthcoming will provide more insight that will be helpful to you all We would love to share this with you and also discuss your system direction There may be some opportunities for us to work together on the development I would like to have a discussion to talk about next steps and believe Andy is planning to initiate this after he returns from holiday Let me know if you have some other ideas Im sorry that we didnt have a chance to get together last week while I was in London My trip was very short and I kept missing you when I went to your desk Ill plan some time with you when Im there next time Mike Jordan AM To Brenda F CT cc Sally CT Subject Re Metals Brenda It strikes me that the planning documentation could be enormously useful to us in backtesting our existing processes and determining any potential overlaps Is there any obstacle to access to this information Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Brenda F Herod To Andrew CT cc Mike CT Paul CT John CT Roy CT Michael E CT Kristen J CT Yvette G NRON Jill nronXgate Delmar nronXgate Daniel nronXgate Subject Re Metals Andy Thanks so much for your message I had you on my To Do list today to followup from our conversation last week I appreciate your responses and will followup as needed Just to recap EIMs current inititives PriceWaterhouseCoopers PWC was engaged in to develop a business plan for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical business In AA was engaged to develop a Blueprint of EIM major processes Deal Execution Deal Capture Risk Management Logistics Settlements and Financial Reporting down to level processes The initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the Blueprint a gap analysis of Enron systems to business needs and recommended systems A complete roadmap should be laid out with a months months months and months timeline The plan addresses tactical also Our overall objective Build an infrastructure people processes and systems that is scalable and supports the trading business of EIM The current industries are Forest Products and Steel However additional industries may be added The targeted infrastructure would require little change to support new industries The delieverable is expected by the end of Wed be happy to visit with you all video conference or Houston to give you more information Let me know how to proceed Thanks again for your time Since I wasnt able to attend the Controllers Conference last Im glad I got to meet you last week Stay in touch Brenda To Brenda F CT cc Mike CT Paul CT Subject Metals Brenda As discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality between Enron Metals and EIM that should allow leverage off common goals In particular I promised info on a few areas Project Q assessment A lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to Enron Metals being to do with interfaces with our AS ysstem however high level issues which formed part of the decision to not develop this for Enron metals were Q is over specified for metals Traffic logistics for metals is less complex than oil coal Metals process tends towards BuyStoreSell whereas for liquids the storage is not as prevelant Metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is shipbarge Inventory Controls Again the reports produced here have been very specific to Enron Metals Paul Wallace a manager in the coordination function is working extensively on developing the controls in this area I would suggest that you contact Paul directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in general Funding of inventory We have a structured finance facility here in London The deal is specific to Enron Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are the base index for all the positions placed in the facility If structured financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either David Tregar Metals Commercial or Bill Appleby Global Finance as an intro to the issues faced Curve Management Process The markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location EG for Copper this means we have a grid with brand groups and sets of port groups for europe for the US and for the Far East The maintaince price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points ie price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote Re recruitment of paper traders I havent been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David Rosenblum one of the metals traders in Chicago is a trader of recylced paper Ill keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London Id appreciate same for EIM Regards Andy
