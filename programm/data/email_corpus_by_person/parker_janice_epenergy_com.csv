in FERC Docket No RP Subject Proposals for Southerns Order No Meeting On August Southern filed proposed changes to its services in Docket No RP in response to the requirements of FERC Order No As a result of customer comments on its filing Southern posted a notice of a meeting with parties that intervened in this proceeding to be held as follows Date Thursday November Time am pm Eastern Time Location Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta Georgia in the Executive Conference Center Airport Atrium Suite see directions below We have a few spaces left at the meeting To RSVP please call Ms Lane Fletcher at Our goal for this meeting is to gain a common understanding of all the proposals and to reach consensus solutions on the issues that have been raised To facilitate discussion and resolution at the meeting Southern provides the following summary of customer comments it received and additional changes Southern is willing to make in the context of a settlement of all issues If you have any questions about these proposals please do not hesitate to contact me or Patty Francis prior to the meeting Janice H Parker Director Customer Services Directions to the Executive Conference Center Airport Atrium Suite Hartsfield Airport Atlanta GA After departing from your plane Follow the directions to the baggage claim area In the baggage claim area follow the flow of traffic up the escalator Turn right for entrance into the Atrium an area similar to a shopping mall located in the center of the airport between the North and South terminals Inside the Atrium catch the elevator to the rd floor The Executive Conference Center is located beside Houlihans Restaurant From ground level After your arrival at Hartsfield Airport come to the second nd level Pass through Ticketing or Baggage Claim and come to the area where the Car Rental Agencies are located between North and South terminals Notice signs above for the Atrium an area similar to a shopping mall Inside the Atrium catch the elevator to the rd floor The Executive Conference Center is located beside Houlihans Restaurant FOR SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS ONLY Summary of Customer Comments and Southerns Responsive Proposals Docket No RP I OFOs AND PENALTIES Comment Provide objective criteria for issuing and lifting OFOs including information that will help customers better understand operational situation being addressed Response SNG does or will post warnings and forecasts in advance of OFOs and will work with customers to clarify tariff language on a mutually agreeable basis Comment A penalty for Type Alert Mode OFO is not reasonable is more reasonable Response In the spirit of compromise SNG would be willing to decrease the penalty to per dth as part of a settlement package Comment The short notice and harsh penalty of the Type Emergency Mode OFO is unreasonable for the following reasons Customers need more time to make adjustments o Only implement if a Type Critical Mode OFO is already in place o hours notice would be more appropriate Limit application to abusive shipper behavior Clarify tariff that penalty only applies at start of gas day and not intraday Shorter notice is not justified because if implemented too late a firm shipper cannot bump IT on last nomination cycle Justify adding the gas price to the penalty The increased penalty price is really an increase in imbalance charges without other benefits Use Gas Dailys Midpoint Louisiana Onshore South daily index price instead of the one proposed Response As part of a settlement package SNG is willing to make the following changes to its Type Emergency Mode OFO Type Emergency Mode OFO can be implemented at the start of the gas day on i hours prior notice or ii hours prior notice ONLY if a Type Alert or Critical Mode OFO is in effect for the previous day telephone notice will be given when the penalty is upgraded to Emergency Language limiting the application of each OFO is set forth in Section of the tariffs general terms and conditions SNG is willing to repeat this language in this specific OFO section of the tariff however so that customers feel comfortable that implementation of this penalty will be targeted to the operational problem areas on the system or specific offenders whenever possible SNG will clarify that penalties only apply at the start of a gas day and can be cancelled during a gas day if not needed due to a change in conditions Since advance notice must always be given prior to the start of a gas day am CCT shippers can adjust nominations on the Intraday nomination cycle am CCT and bump IT At the meeting SNG will further discuss the reasons its penalties including the higher penalty for Type Emergency Mode are needed to preserve the operational integrity of the system Comment The change to Type OFOs could result in a shipper in a group being penalized even if it is within tolerance at a point Response At the meeting SNG will review an example of how the proposed changes to the Type OFO will actually avoid shipperspecific penalties at a point when the point or group of receipt points is within tolerance This provision will only help never hurt a shipper II SEGMENTATION Comment SNG currently allows firm shippers to segment their capacity by rate zone It should be operationally feasible to provide more segmentation especially along Southerns two main trunklines Response SNG has reviewed its operational model and has isolated two long line segments of its pipeline along which it could allow intrazone segmentation in an operationally feasible manner At the meeting SNG will review the physical attributes of its system that led to this model To be able to provide this level of intrazone segmentation the program would have the following attributes SNG will retain its existing segmentation program but will layer on top of that the ability for a shipper to fully segment along identified long line segments of its north or south system up to the firm capacity that the customer has on the long line being segmented For example if a customer has north system capacity into zone it can do intrazone segmentation along the long line portion of the north system through zone up to its contract quantity on the north system On the long line on which the shipper has firm capacity the shipper can nominate to primary or secondary delivery points so long as the nominations do not overlap along the long line segment The shipper will have to path its receipts and deliveries for the portion of its nomination where it wishes to do intrazone segments This allows SNG to verify that segments do not overlap The first delivery point being segmented can be served by an upstream supply pool or storage but all downstream segments must be served by physical receipttodelivery combinations Allocated receipts serving an intrazone segmented delivery would have to meet or exceed the segmented delivery to avoid overlapping segments and qualify for the FT commodity rate SNG is in the process of determining the programming requirements to add this new more complex model and will provide an estimate at the meeting III CAPACITY RELEASE AND SCHEDULING EQUALITY Comment SNG should allow customers to offer and bid on capacity release deals before each of the four nomination cycles In its filing Southern has offered to enhance its capacity release procedures to allow prearranged nonbiddable deals to be awarded prior to each nomination cycle but keep biddable deals awarded according to the GISB standards prior to the Timely Nomination Cycle Response While Southern is not required to offer these additional options under Order No it would be willing as part of a settlement to add an offerbid capacity release opportunity prior to the Evening Nomination Cycle GISB is developing standards for intraday capacity releases and Southern proposes to wait until the standards are approved to offer more flexibility due to the programming complexity Comment Changes that require programming should be implemented as soon as possible if ready prior to the time estimated by SNG in its filing Response Southern will implement all changes as soon as the programming is ready and it will give days advance notice of the implementation date Comment Southern should allow releases of FTNN service on a nonotice basis as soon as possible Response As noted in its filing Southern is in the process of programming this functionality and proposes to implement it on March Southern plans to make its tariff filing in midJanuary and will host a conference call to discuss the tariff filing in early December IV IMBALANCE MANAGEMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS Comment Customers need more than business days to elect to trade imbalances because imbalances are not final at the time of the election deadline Response Effective December for November imbalances Southern has filed to implement the new GISB standard that gives customers business days after the end of the month to elect to trade imbalances and to complete the trades Comment Southern should allow customers to use other customers CSSISS storage accounts to resolve imbalances at the end of the month Response While Southern is concerned that this may increase the level of imbalances in an overall settlement it would be willing to add this option subject to active confirmation by the other customer whose storage account is used to resolve the imbalance Comment Imbalances and overrun penalties should be based on the lesser of operational or actual data Response Southern calculates both an estimated imbalance percentage on the last day of the month and an actual imbalance percentage and uses the lesser of the two percentages when cashing out imbalances On the overrun comment Southern bills all volumes actually metered but fills up a customers firm transportation service within a zone prior to billing IT overrun Comment Cash out revenues in excess of the index prices less expenses incurred by SNG for cash out gas should be credited to the SCRM account Response Southern does credit all revenues received for cash out and will provide an overview of the items that affect the SCRM account at the meeting Comment Southern received comments in support of and in opposition to the collection of injection or withdrawal fees on the net imbalance resolved with storage at the end of the month It was suggested that Southern should go further and collect the fee on the daily instead of net imbalance resolved through storage Response Southern believes that its proposal is reasonable and equitable for the reasons given in its filing Comment Southern should be required to honor discounts to alternate delivery points within the capacity path of the point receiving the discount Response Generally FT reservation charge discounts continue to apply even when alternate delivery points are nominated Any limitations on the applicability of the discount to specific points will be agreed to as part of the discount and will be set out in the discount exhibit THIS DOCUMENT IS PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL AND INTENDED FOR
