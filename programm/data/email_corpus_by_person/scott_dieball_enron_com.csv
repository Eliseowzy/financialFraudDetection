used here suggest you decline andmake them clarify LOL ISSUES I suppose that this is a NY law contract I do not think you can effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct in NY Regardless of choice of law we generally cannot get this limited or excluded in contracts with owners either I think you should not accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or otherwise and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any to the fullest extent permitted by law clause or other such stuff as a compromise It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment Generally I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity for Haz Mat patents etc They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity for all third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past I would like to think that we could get it clarified now that the

Section iii carve out of the LOL for gross acts of its subcontractors vendors ect GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its subcontractors and vendors I think Section a as written covers simple negligence of GEs subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that we need to keep Section iii as written dealing with gross negligence of GEs subcontractors and vendors Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence Agree Maybe we could agree to GEs strike out in a provided the phrase negligent or willfully wrongful is replaced with negligent at fault or strictly liable without fault or some variation thereof What is a cognizant government Dont know This was not discussed with MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term We need to also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails to comply with law and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty is ordered to shut down the facility Limit of liability issues They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws patent infringement liability for haz waste and liens to of purchase price They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence if possible Agree See st comment above re indemnity They dont want to clarify that they have to

used here suggest you decline andmake them clarify LOL ISSUES I suppose that this is a NY law contract I do not think you can effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct in NY Regardless of choice of law we generally cannot get this limited or excluded in contracts with owners either I think you should not accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or otherwise and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any to the fullest extent permitted by law clause or other such stuff as a compromise It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment Generally I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity for Haz Mat patents etc They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity for all third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past I would like to think that we could get it clarified now that the

Section iii carve out of the LOL for gross acts of its subcontractors vendors ect GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its subcontractors and vendors I think Section a as written covers simple negligence of GEs subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that we need to keep Section iii as written dealing with gross negligence of GEs subcontractors and vendors Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence Agree Maybe we could agree to GEs strike out in a provided the phrase negligent or willfully wrongful is replaced with negligent at fault or strictly liable without fault or some variation thereof What is a cognizant government Dont know This was not discussed with MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term We need to also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails to comply with law and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty is ordered to shut down the facility Limit of liability issues They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws patent infringement liability for haz waste and liens to of purchase price They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence if possible Agree See st comment above re indemnity They dont want to clarify that they have to

indemnities below but dont have the document to refer to Scott please drop by and brief me on these Cognizant Govt Never heard of the term and itis not one of the usual defined terms Dont know how its used here suggest you decline andmake them clarify LOL ISSUES I suppose that this is a NY law contract I do not think you can effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct in NY Regardless of choice of law we generally cannot get this limited or excluded in contracts with owners either I think you should not accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or otherwise and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any to the fullest extent permitted by law clause or other such stuff as a compromise It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment Generally I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity for Haz Mat patents etc They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity for all third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past I would like to think that we could get it clarified now that the

consensus on how to respond Here are the issues I see Indemnity issues They should indemnify us from claims by their employeessubcontractors Kay Is your comment in connection with GEs comment to Section iii carve out of the LOL for gross acts of its subcontractors vendors ect GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its subcontractors and vendors I think Section a as written covers simple negligence of GEs subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that we need to keep Section iii as written dealing with gross negligence of GEs subcontractors and vendors Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence Agree Maybe we could agree to GEs strike out in a provided the phrase negligent or willfully wrongful is replaced with negligent at fault or strictly liable without fault or some variation thereof What is a cognizant government Dont know This was not discussed with MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term We need to also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails to comply with law and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty is ordered to shut down the facility Limit of liability issues They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws patent infringement liability for haz waste and liens to of purchase price They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence if possible Agree See st comment above re indemnity They dont want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another partys claim for consequentials as in a personal injury claim Agree Weve dont have anything concrete on assignment yet Agree Comments I suggest we get together before our next
