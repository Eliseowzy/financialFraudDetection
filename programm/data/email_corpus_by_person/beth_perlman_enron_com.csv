mailtoIMCEANOTESLakeCStephanCslakeanlEgovE NRONcom Sent Wednesday April PM To Perlman Beth Cc Betten Paul R Subject FW Argonne Collaboratory Research Beth Per my other note see enclosed the computational science related projects The point here was to explore the possible development and marketing of very high bandwidth services such as teleimmersion telepresence and various collaboratory techniques Computational power on demand from large computational grids which could be bought and sold like electricity is another project under development at the Lab Again both ideas involve collaborations between our organizations to develop new approaches that ENRON could transform into new commodity items that could be traded I also am interested in exploring new approaches in energy storage via new generation flywheel energy storage systems that would be installed at substations These units would allow companies to store power at night while rates and demand are lower and then use it during peak periods The idea here is that this would provide more power as needed without new electrical infrastructures These systems could be used again as a new commodity electric power storage space All of these items are in the development stage but with sufficient additional funding and technical collaboration from ENRON and its partner companies new value from new services could be generated We also are a leader in developing high temperature superconductivity wire for use in electric power cables which will enable considerably more power to move through the same space This will enable areas that are power strapped and space constrained such as in large urban areas to push more electricity without very expensive upgrades to the related infrastructure such as roads sidewalks buildingsetc I have provided a few URLs below for your associates review Our homepage is at which is the launch site for much of the information on the labs capabilities We also have a software shop under the technology transfer button on the top row middle section which might be of interest to you Regards Stephan Lake Manager Business Development and Marketing Argonne National

Subject Argonne Collaboratory Research Ross I enjoyed talking with you today regarding your business As we discussed Im attaching a few URLs that describe our research in various collaboratory and immersive environments DOEcollabshtml divisionresearchhtml The goal of this work is develop technology to assist collaboratory actions over high bandwidth environments Scientists engineers designers and probably bankers lawyers accountants and other professional staff will have significant new tools in forming and working a collaboration forum The bulk of this research is done in our mathematics and computer science division You may also notice an additional collaboratory activity which is telepresence In this case scientists can remotely manipulate scientific equipment such as electronic microscopes as well as discuss the results with others as the experiment is underway This approach actually allows collaborating parties to reach out and control machines safely over the internet This is far beyond just changing a camera angle or moving a microscope stage Ive also included a URL on the computational grid concept which provides heavy computational power on demand in a way not dissimiliar to the electric generation and distribution business If your clients are faced with the need to access enormous files of hard copy information that needs to be put in a manner that can used easily over the internet we have developed an interesting approach DOE has over pages of hard copy documents from various sources on the human radiation experiments conducted over many years These documents can easily be accessed and manipulated through an special search engine Our other information research division the Decision Information Sciences Division built and operated this application You can view it at diswebdatt As a side note this division has unique skills in developing technology to solve problems that have enormous amounts of date The division also has developed energy planning software and trained many foreign government energy planners on the use of that software Regards Steve Lake Argonne National Laboratory

the problems were having with the UNIX operating system and our code This resource has requested that we bring on an additional application specialist from SUN This has been authorized and the additional resource is scheduled to be on site next week I also have my resources and the UNIX administrators working along side the Sun resources As an aside we are also experiencing performance problems with the gas side of the business I met with Sally Becks controllers yesterday and we are putting a plan in place The increased trading volumes have seriously impacted our through put and we now have a blitz on to correct the issues These problems have not gone unnoticed I assure you that IT has been very diligent in following through on these problems Were investing heavily in additional hardware bringing in contractors and hiring additional resources at an average of per week I will keep you posted as we continue to enhance our existing systems Beth John J NRON PM To Beth CT David W

David W CT Kristin CT Beth CT Subject Power Port Calc Issues Guys This Enpower calc issue is a joke How can we be the most Innovative Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem Furthermore how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our power transactions when our back office risk books position management settlements is so unreliable from an IT standpoint In addition we will start losing all of our key people in this area because they are here until every night and pm on holidays This whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt with accordingly Please advise Thank you Forwarded by Kevin M PrestoHOUECT on PM Enron North America Corp From Kristin Albrecht AM To Beth CT Randy NRON Jarod CT Christine CT Zhiyong CT Ravi CT Stacey W CT Jenny CT Jenny nron cc Sally CT Kevin M CT Tim CT Subject Power Port Calc Issues The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the power port calc The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the message below is not resolved we have had this problem for about four months now Due to business reasons we calculated the east power books on Monday Enron holiday We received all of the required data to calc by AM and should have been completely done by However the calc crashed six times and finally completed on the seventh try We were able to leave by The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders by the start of the next business day This could have a financial impact on our company Once again I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution of this problem Furthermore it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing business that is using that server Per discussion with Kevin Presto the agreement made regarding EESs use of EnPower was there would be no expense or degradation to ENAs business process I think they need to move to another server Please call to discuss when this will be resolved Thank You Kristin Albrecht Forwarded by Kristin AlbrechtHOUECT on AM Enron North America Corp From Kristin Albrecht AM To Beth CT Randy NRON Jarod CT Christine CT Zhiyong CT Ravi CT Stacey W CT Jenny CT cc Subject athena vs quark With regards to the message below we must have athena server to run our nightly risk books for the power group We run one of our three east power calcs on this machine the second largest one Since an acceptable solution for the big power calc has not been provided to us athena CANNOT be taken away from us The east power calc crashed out of days last week We usually start calcing at about The calc time is now running at hours and we have about hours worth of work after the calcs successful completion So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building when the calc crashes at Furthermore the West power calc has crashed out of nights weekly for the last weeks This is not acceptable We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our system is not stable I feel like we have been very patient at the expense of many late nights I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden today about these problems I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted with the finger pointing between different IT groups Thanks Kristin Albrecht Forwarded by Kristin AlbrechtHOUECT on

From Perlman Beth Sent Friday January PM To Muller Mark S Piper Greg Golden Jeff Dietrich Janet Daniels E ddy Schuler Lance Legal McMahon Jeffrey Cc Hall Bob M Subject FW Services Company As many of you are aware we have been kicking around an idea relating to a services company that would perform middleback office services to the ene rgy industry This was being considered for the following reasons Reduce expenses to the estate and Newco Revenue opportunities relating to licensing software Career opportunities for estate staff retention The memo to Jeff McMahon below outlines the opportunity This has been dis cussed for the past months We are currently engaged in discussions with Accenture They are the only service provider who could perform the outso urcing and provide the channel for a service bureau type company It has come to my attention that there may be limitations in the UBS deal t hat preclude the estate from performing in the capacity of a service compan y in the areas of gas and power trading My questions are what is the interpretation because there seems to be conflicting in the master and sub license agreements what was actually agreed upon and if the answ er is not favorable is there an opportunity to negotiate disagree argue Greg Piper and I have been working on this and he may have contacted you co ncerning these points Im not sure how to proceed but I do need to know what I can and cannot do with Accenture Jeff Golden and I spoke yesterda y and Jeff thought that if the processing areas that I am concerned about d o not constitute a majority of the cost of the operation that it may be O K Thank you for taking the time to assist Any help is greatly appreciated Beth Original Message From McMahon Jeffrey Sent Saturday January PM To Beck Sally Cc Perlman Beth Piper Greg Subject RE Services Company Great work Absolutely proceed to the next level Please check with Mark Muller re any potential non compete on thisI am certain though there will not be one In fact Netco could be our biggest customer Proably ne ed someone from corp devt involved once you bring in the the consulting fir m I would suggest that the reorganized Enron could provide these services to Netco the Estate the consulting firm etc Original Message From Beck Sally Sent Fri PM To McMahon Jeffrey Cc Perlman Beth Piper Greg Subject Services Company Beth Perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of the Enron Estate that I believe has a lot of merit As you may know one o f our business goals within Enron Net Works in was to commercialize mi d and back office services With the money and talent that has been poured into Enrons trading operations systems and processes we believed that th ere could be market demand for these services Ironically enough we had s ecured our first services customer and were to begin providing these servic es on December Understandably the customer became concerned during Nov ember and the deal was shelved Our experience was that there was much int erest in mid and back office services coupling our systems and our people but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed Enr on that was offering these services The market place didnt want us to w in again as Enron Obviously the world has changed While effort is currently focused on the formation of Netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts withi n EGM EIM EA EES etc I think that we would shortchange the Estate if we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal s tage in order to evaluate its potential value for the Estate The idea wou ld be to form this services company with a consulting firm which could pro vide some capital additional resource pool and a ready sales channel Wit h the potential of spinoff companies from Enron and with former Enron empl oyees taking jobs with other firms many doors would be opened for this in dependent services company to provide services Servicing the Enron Estat e could be the first engagement for this services company Depending upon the structure of the deal benefits to the Enron Estate could be reduced co sts for systems and services perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of th e CommodityLogic tools the possibility of some revenue stream from other services engagements etc Another important aspect of this idea is that f or the systems and operations professionals this would create a true caree r opportunity a service bureau offering through an established consulting firm making it much more likely that these people could be retained Beth and I met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept There is definite interest so we discussed the idea with Greg Piper today We a sked him for clarification around the Netco agreement regarding systems an d I believe that he has copied you on a note to Anne Koehler regarding this Our ability to process transactions is one of Enrons assets and our ho pe would be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around that asset in the way that the Netco agreement has been drafted The next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due dili gence process so that a proposal could be presented for the Estates consid eration Beth and I would like to move forward with the proposal stage I t would be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be followed to consider the proposal If we as Enron felt that there is merit to the proposal would there simply be an approval process with the Credit ors Committee and the Court Would there have to be some sort of open bid ding process on the proposal To set expectations within the consulting fi rm it would be good to be able to give them a feel for

the problems were having with the UNIX operating system and our code This resource has requested that we bring on an additional application specialist from SUN This has been authorized and the additional resource is scheduled to be on site next week I also have my resources and the UNIX administrators working along side the Sun resources As an aside we are also experiencing performance problems with the gas side of the business I met with Sally Becks controllers yesterday and we are putting a plan in place The increased trading volumes have seriously impacted our through put and we now have a blitz on to correct the issues These problems have not gone unnoticed I assure you that IT has been very diligent in following through on these problems Were investing heavily in additional hardware bringing in contractors and hiring additional resources at an average of per week I will keep you posted as we continue to enhance our existing systems Beth John J NRON PM To Beth CT David W CT cc Subject Power Port Calc Issues Beth Please respond with a plan to solve these problems Thanks John Forwarded by John J LavoratoCorpEnron on PM From Kevin M Presto ECT PM To John Lavorato cc David W CT Kristin CT Beth CT Subject Power Port Calc Issues Guys This Enpower calc issue is a joke How can we be the most Innovative Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem Furthermore how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our power transactions when our back office risk books position management settlements is so unreliable from an IT standpoint In addition we will start losing all of our key people in this area because they are here until every night and pm on holidays This whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt with accordingly Please advise Thank you Forwarded by Kevin M PrestoHOUECT on PM Enron North America Corp From Kristin Albrecht AM To Beth CT Randy NRON Jarod CT Christine CT Zhiyong CT Ravi CT Stacey W CT Jenny CT Jenny nron cc Sally CT Kevin M CT Tim CT Subject Power Port Calc Issues The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the power port calc The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the message below is not resolved we have had this problem for about four months now Due to business reasons we calculated the east power books on Monday Enron holiday We received all of the required data to calc by AM and should have been completely done by However the calc crashed six times and finally completed on the seventh try We were able to leave by The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders by the start of the next business day This could have a financial impact on our company Once again I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution of this problem Furthermore it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing business that is using that server Per discussion with Kevin Presto the agreement made regarding EESs use of EnPower was there would be no expense or degradation to ENAs business process I think they need to move to another server Please call to discuss when this will be resolved Thank You Kristin Albrecht Forwarded by Kristin AlbrechtHOUECT on AM Enron North America Corp From Kristin Albrecht AM To Beth CT Randy NRON Jarod CT Christine CT Zhiyong CT Ravi CT Stacey W CT Jenny CT cc Subject athena vs quark With regards to the message below we must have athena server to run our nightly risk books for the power group We run one of our three east power calcs on this machine the second largest one Since an acceptable solution for the big power calc has not been provided to us athena CANNOT be taken away from us The east power calc crashed out of days last week We usually start calcing at about The calc time is now running at hours and we have about hours worth of work after the calcs successful completion So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building when the calc crashes at Furthermore the West power calc has crashed out of nights weekly for the last weeks This is not acceptable We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our system is not stable I feel like we have been very patient at the expense of many late nights I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden today about these problems I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted with the finger pointing between different IT groups Thanks Kristin Albrecht Forwarded by Kristin AlbrechtHOUECT on AM Christine Nguyen PM To Ravi CT cc Randy NRON Subject athena vs quark Ravi Please advise your users that athena will be completely unavailable starting WednesdayMay The production server is quark gb RAMxprocs quark is configured to our standard for your use Thanks Christine
