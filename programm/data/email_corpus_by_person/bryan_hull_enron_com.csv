and old armyand red ass and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat UT and blah blah blah Shut up You start to get the feeling the entire school was built to spite UT Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the s passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main school University of Texas that would teach agriculture and mechanics Aggies love to say their school is older from where they get that I dont nowthe fact is the State intended AM to be a branch of UT They are like the afterbirth fromthe original creation Like Danny Devito in Twins So they apparently have this complex so much so that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good All the while nobody at UT denies that AM is a good school yet they wont shut up So they write a fight songaboutTexas and how they want to beat them They have a Fish Camp for freshman where they tell them how bad Texas is and how good AM and all its traditions are It is the worlds largest known case of penis envy and it is manifested in everything AM does The people at AM Now we all have friends who went to AM or are at AM There are some nice people there Howeverthere is the Corp East Texas answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere For every boy scout who never learned to stop playing with his GI Joe Toys there is the Corp Now forget the fact that AM will actually let people with subpar grades enroll if they agree to join the Corp Forget the fact that the Corps looked like a Gestapo hate rally while beating down students on Kyle Field in Forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that have been filed against them and swept under the rug over the years they just this past month have had one Corps member bring charges against another Corps member who apparently had been propositioning others for a little actual sodomy Not only could I go on with more instances of idiocracy by these Khakicladshavenheadeddorks I am sure each of you have your own stories The point is We all respect West Point Annapolis The Air Force Academy however nobody respects the Corp I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world Just because you dress like the Army and try and act like the Army does not make you the Army People at AM dont even respect these clowns It is not cool to shave your head and dress up Halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year If you want to carry guns and beat up civilians move to Israel It is even less cool to slobber on somebodys daughter on national television and call it a tradition Dry humping year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool Not only is it not cool it should be against the law I know that in College Station students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn or in the middle of class or anytime anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start sucking on her face But everywhere else in the world it is looked down upon Especially if you are doing it on my TV That is why we have moved the game from Thanksgiving Because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight coed during somebodys Thanksgiving dinner We do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board Some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique counter Screw that forget makeup it is too late for that just give them a veil tu is not funny It is NOT insulting It is dumb Just imagine if folks from Texas kept talking about MA and giggling That would not be funny In fact it would be retarded Thats why UT fans dont do it Please learn You want to lose the image of country bumpkins of a people fond of sheep of people that arent stupid Then quit building things that fall downQuit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national TV Quit whooping in church Quit whooping period Quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals Quit spending your Friday nights practicing how to yell Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when youre running for Governor When you are filling out season ticket renewals and the form asks for your phone H W quit putting Height Weight Just collectively stop making asses of yourselves Go to East Texas tour every small town and ask every red neck with a th grade education why they cheer for AM and wear maroon That is your fan base This is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid Nobody cares if you think your band is better They might be louder they might march in neat little zig zags but they have no musical ability The point is nobody cares who wins halftime Quit getting geeked up about marching bands I find it hard to believe you stood through your high school bands entire halftime performance And why Cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now Plus you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care Why is it cool all of a sudden now that youre in college Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds Perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe Oh waitI understand now Dogs are not ladies They dont look or smell like ladies Dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly Finally College Station is an armpit of a town Quit pretending that it is a great college town It is a town and there is a college thereThat should be the end of this comparison If you feel that life doesnt get any better than the Dixie Chicken and enjoy being stuck in a never ending Dukes of Hazard episode then move there More importantly dont move to Austinthey are trying to create an educated technological and open minded population base Austin is and will continue to be the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool As my friend Stephen Johnson once said If the world were ever to get an enema College Station is where you would connect the hose If you go to school at AM please dont be an Aggie

<20518895.1075840437929.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bryan.hull@enron.com,2001-08-14 05:24:28,FW Section pst Just so you know this is what I sent Redmond about that case Original Message From Hull Bryan Sent Tuesday August AM To Redmond Brian Subject FW Section Brian this is a pretty good explanation of the case thus far Commissioner Wood is aware of the conflict between PGE now EPGT and Southern Union probably because of lobbying by Southern Union and that is why he raised the issue Southern Union states in its initial brief below that it opposes the high demand rates that it says EPGT proposes to charge for a service that does not incorporate the consumer protections of Order No and argues that FERC should impose Order No standards on PGE I was watching a video stream of the meeting and the whole discussion seemed to come out of nowhere Here are the facts in this case On December PGE Texas Pipeline LP the predecessor to EPGT Texas Pipeline LP filed a petition with FERC for approval of transportation rates under Section along as they were required to do All intrastate pipelines that perform Section service must either have their rates approved by FERC or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service PGEs filing proposed in addition to the usual interruptible service a firm Section service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service PGE also filed a revised Statement of Operating Conditions to reflect the new services On February Southern Union Gas Company an intrastate transportation customer of PGE filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing PGE opposed the late intervention but FERC granted it on April PGE stated that Southern Union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service Southern Union submitted data requests to PGE on April and April PGE attempted to get a protective order issued but FERC rejected their request A settlement conference was held on September A Staff Panel was convened on October in order to conduct an advisory nonevidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues with instructions to make recommendations to the Commission within days On November FERC requested pages of additional information from PGE in order to complete the application in the proceeding which PGE provided on November th On December th PGE provided additional information in response to a FERC data request On January Southern Union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by PGE On January El Paso Field Services informed FERC that PGE Texas Pipeline LP had been acquired by El Paso on December and that the name was changed to EPGT Texas Pipeline LP On January EPGT Texas and Southern Union filed initial briefs On July EPGT filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at FERC summarized below where Commissioner Wood inquired about the extension of some Order No and provisions to Section service providers EPGT stated that if FERC proceeds with this policy it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding On July Southern Union filed reply comments opposing EPGTs supplemental comments On August EPGT filed an amended Statement of Operating Conditions which provides for electronic nominations two additional nomination cycles bumping clarified and updated credit provisions modified quality provisions to protect system integrity and more clearly defined authorized overrun service The NGPA gives FERC authority over intrastate pipeline rates for Section service and requires that such service be provided on a nondiscriminatory basis but there is some question as to whether it gives FERC authority to require for example compliance with Order Nos and Please let me know if this is enough detail or maybe its more than you wanted
