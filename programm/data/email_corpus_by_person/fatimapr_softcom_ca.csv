<2376830.1075852674517.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,fatimapr@softcom.ca,2001-09-17 10:18:15,Re Your invitation to cover Rome Peace ConferenceYou would not be a successful journalist if you had always played it safe and gone along with conventional thinking Being able to think outside the box is the mark of an openminded person who can see the truth in an unexpected way Being open to the unexpected is essential to good investigative journalism What is the single greatest political story in the world today Clearly it is the worldwide escalation of violence and bloodshed especially in the Middle East According to the latest annual report of the Red Cross there are more armed conflicts raging around the world now than at any time since World War II Is there a different angle to the story of a world full of bloody conflict Yes there is It has nothing to do with covering yet another conference of world leaders or yet another round of failed ArabIsraeli negotiations This angle would require a journalist to think outside the box in a very big way for the perspective we are talking about is not the worlds perspective but Heavens perspective Suspend your natural skepticism for a moment and consider this On October some people gathered in a muddy field in Fatima Portugal to witness what three little children said would be a miracle at noon that day Precisely at the moment predicted the huge crowd saw the sun spin in the sky throw off unimaginable colors and then plunge toward the earth only to return to its normal position in the sky The muddy field became bone dry in an instant as did the rainsoaked crowd Secular newspapers including the New York Times reported the event Warner Brothers later made a movie based upon it Everyone in that crowdbelievers and nonbelievers alikeexperienced the Miracle of the Sun that day There is no precedent in world history for a public miracle whose occurrence was precisely predicted three months in advance What was the point of the Miracle of the Sun It was a sign given to authenticate what the three children had been told by the Blessed Virgin Mary in a series of earlier apparitions in that very same field The children asked the Virgin to provide a Miracle so the people would believe what She had told them And what the Virgin told them was this God will grant peace to the world when Russia is solemnly and publicly Consecrated to the Virgin Mary by the Pope together with all the Catholic bishops of the world But the Virgin also warned that if the Consecration is not done Russia would spread its errors throughout the world there would be wars and persecutions and that ultimately various nations will be annihilated Weeks before the Russian revolution of the Virgin of Fatima accurately predicted the end of World War I the emergence of world communism the election of Pope Pius XI the beginning of World War II and worldwide persecution of the Catholic Church by communist regimes which continues today So far the accuracy of the Fatima predictions is No wonder Pope John Paul II has personally attested to the authenticity of the Message of Fatima Indeed the Pope escaped death at the hands of an assassin on the very anniversary of the first Fatima apparition Even Newsweek magazine in a cover story on the Virgin Mary recognized the relation of the Fatima events to the collapse of communism in Russia Yet for various reasons the Consecration of Russia called for by the Virgin at Fatima remains undone and the collapse of communism has not brought peace to the world Given the utter accuracy of the Virgins predictions can the world simply ignore Her warning about the annihilation of nations Conventional thinkers may scoff at such things as miracles and apparitions of the Virgin Mary But today the cause of world peace requires the setting aside of such prejudices It requires the courage to admit that man must look to a power greater than himself and to a source beyond the limitations of earthly reality This is your invitation to attend and cover an important conference on the Message of Fatima and its utmost relevance to the quest for world peace now more urgent than ever before From October th to th at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome dignitaries and speakers from around the world will consider how Heavens plan for peace can be accomplished now while there is yet time We are now mailing out conference information packages and written invitations Contact Coralie Graham Editor of The Fatima Crusader at or call or fax to confirm your attendance if you do not receive your written invitation by September th to receive further information You can also find more information on our Web site We look forward to seeing you in October in Rome
