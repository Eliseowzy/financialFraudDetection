Deal Dave Chris I wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern NW GE EA deal should close today or tomorrow and advise you of a related earnings recognition issue The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed DASH and works as follows at the signing of the letter agreement NW pays ENA million with another million paid on July the Turbine Deposits The balance of million is paid by NW at such time as the assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC and ENA sells the LLC member interests to NW The outside date for this to occur via a notice provided by NW is Sept The million paid by NW and the obligation to purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern Corp The only condition to NWs obligation to purchase the member interests is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC If ENA does not effect the assignment then NW would also be entitled to a return of the million in Turbine Deposits This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in January except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the date of execution of the letter agreement and the turbine contract assignment In the Intergen deal ENA did not receive any payments prior to the assignment and sale of the member interests The earnings issue raised by accounting Herman Manis is that notwithstanding NWs firm commitment to purchase ENA has two albeit very minor performance obligations First ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC we have had to do this for every turbine transaction Second ENA has to perform under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior to the time we effect the assignment we theoretically could loose our purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our agreement with NW We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are perfunctory in nature and that all income from this transaction should be recognized upon execution of the letter agreement We have further stated that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue but there is no solution to the second issue Herman advised us that to the extent we receive a letter from GE on the first issue and can convince Arthur Anderson that the second item is perfunctory in nature we could recognize all income upon execution of the letter agreement prior to the actual assignment of the turbine contract to the LLC He did not think we had a good case relative to the second issue and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson Thus based on the above in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any income form this transaction until Q While we think we have a shot at getting accounting to change their position we do not think that this outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying profitability is significant The deal is also consistent with the approved DASH We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter agreement and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized in Q vs Q Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled or if you have any other questions Regards Ben

of the letter agreement prior to the actual assignment of the turbine contract to the LLC He did not think we had a good case relative to the second issue and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson Thus based on the above in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any income form this transaction until Q While we think we have a shot at getting accounting to change their position we do not think that this outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying profitability is significant The deal is also consistent with the approved DASH We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter agreement and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized in Q vs Q Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled or if you have any other questions Regards Ben

sign the deal He said environmentalists got the best deal possible in the current energy climate Look at whats happening with power plant approvals in California right now said Chabot referring to the states push to bring new energy sources on line The Moss Landing project which is scheduled to add megawatts in enough to serve one million homes is a key part of that energy expansion plan No money will go to the four environmental groups the Center for Marine Conservation along with Save Our Shores Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter Project It will be routed in five yearly installments of

Duke roll with a big chunk of money I would say they rolled the California Energy Commission and the Regional Water Board for the price of mitigation Chabot said The agencies got bought off cheap And the environment got taken to the cleaners Dukes Williams strongly disagreed Environmental mitigation must be based on science not on buying anybody off he said That is inappropriate and we would not participate in that That suggestion is offensive to us And it should be offensive to any environmentalist Bob Haussler head of the Energy Commissions environmental protection office said the

Duke can come in and buy them off I have a real problem with that Construction began in November on Dukes project to add megawatts of natural gasfired electrical capacity to the Moss Landing plant purchased from PGE in If the expansion is finished next year as scheduled it would account for more than percent of all new generation in California in This is a big deal said Williams the Duke spokesman It will be the largest plant in California If that plant is delayed a month or two we lose the summer of And that affects not only Duke Energy but the state of California Opponents say its not the power they oppose but the plants cooling system which will pump about billion gallons of seawater each day from Moss Landing Harbor Such pumping they say will degrade Elkhorn Slough They argue for an alternative cooling system such as towers that recirculate water Basically what that plant will do is take percent of the volume of the harbor and slough run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with much of the marine life cooked and dead said Steve Shimek executive director of the Otter Project For Shimek and other environmentalists scientific studies commissioned by Duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the plants impact on the environment There was no scientific evidence that would literally point to Duke causing harm to the environment said Vicki Nichols executive director of Save Our Shores We felt we didnt have strong standing to sue Instead the environmentalists began negotiating with Duke for financial payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project The process gave me tremendous pause and great concern Nichols said I knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong thing She was right As far as Im concerned with the pricegouging going on by the energy wholesalers they are just receiving stolen goods said Clark of the citizens group Her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that Duke Energy approached Gov Gray Davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator Chabot with the Center for Marine Conservation discouraged any comparison between the two offers calling it grossly unfair and inaccurate Regardless of what was intended with the payments Nielson said they stain the process It is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical she said Shimek took a different view We convinced Duke to spend million toward monitoring that frankly five years from now could very well come back to haunt them he said Did we do the right thing I have no idea Did we try our best Yes we did

about billion gallons of seawater each day from Moss Landing Harbor Such pumping they say will degrade Elkhorn Slough They argue for an alternative cooling system such as towers that recirculate water Basically what that plant will do is take percent of the volume of the harbor and slough run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with much of the marine life cooked and dead said Steve Shimek executive director of the Otter Project For Shimek and other environmentalists scientific studies commissioned by Duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the plants impact on the environment There was no scientific evidence that would literally point to Duke causing harm to the environment said Vicki Nichols executive director of Save Our Shores We felt we didnt have strong standing to sue Instead the environmentalists began negotiating with Duke for financial payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project The process gave me tremendous pause and great concern Nichols said I knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong thing She was right As far as Im concerned with the pricegouging going on by the energy wholesalers they are just receiving stolen goods said Clark of the citizens group Her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that Duke Energy approached Gov Gray Davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator Chabot with the Center for Marine Conservation discouraged any comparison between the two offers calling it grossly unfair and inaccurate Regardless of what was intended with the payments Nielson said they stain the process It is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical she said Shimek took a different view We convinced Duke to spend million toward monitoring that frankly five years from now could very well come back to haunt them he said Did we do the right thing I have no idea Did we try our best Yes we did

long we will need to close in addition to increasing the bid on the units I think if our number is good days for documentation and close would work but I think we should also be willing to post some nonrefundable s within say weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe The groups thoughts on this would be appreciated Thanks Original Message From Deffner Joseph Sent Thursday May PM To Jacoby Ben Mann Kay Duran W David Manis Herman Engeldorf Roseann Schneider Chip Bills Lisa Subject RE GE Turbines What is expected for the Tuesday bid I would guess the most critical from a timing perspective will be a response centered on price and commercialtechnical issues Michael indicates below he would like a timetable for internal approvals to a closing Do we have any indication how pressed he is to close and fund versus agreeing on economic terms quickly and allowing us to review the form of contract to ensure compliance with accounting and finance guidlelines along the lines of our discussion earlier this week Thanks Original Message From Jacoby Ben Sent Thursday May PM To Mann Kay Schneider Chip Bills Lisa Manis Herman Engeldorf Roseann Cc Booth Chris Rose Steven Virgo

provided specific guidance on this We have spoke to GE We have advised them of the deal with Northwestern We do not believe the acknowledgement and consent will be a problem and that it will follow the same discussion process as has been going on regarding Pastoria NW does not have negotiating rights on the acknowledgement and consent They must accept it to the extent the one we receive for this deal is substantially the same as the one for Pastoria weve attached the Pastoria form to the letter agreement If NW flakes we keep the million can sue them to close and can resell the units This remote scenario would likely provide us with additional upside The only scenario that we dont get paid are the two scenarios outlined in my previous email we cannot obtain the GE acknowledgement and consent or we otherwise cannot effect the assignment because of a default in E Next NW does not have any other outs The income from the deal is expected to be at least million but could be as high as million depending on the exact closing date and potential LDs we may receive from GE Ive attached the DASH which contains an income analysis Regards Ben Christopher F Calger AM To Ben CT Kay nron cc W David CT Chris nron Subject Re Northwestern Deal Ben and Kay What is our performance obligation to ENext Have we spoken to GE re consents Is GE going to be difficult because this is the Frame division not the Lee J and the LM team Does NW have any discretion approval rights negotiating rights w respect to the assignment to the LLC If NW flakes can we keep the MM or do we have to resell and sue for any shortfall In what scenarios would we not get fully paid Assuming Sep what is the income from this deal Regards Chris Enron North America Corp From Ben F Jacoby AM Sent by Ben Jacoby To W David CT Christopher F CT cc Kay nron Chris nron Subject Northwestern Deal Dave Chris I wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern NW GE EA deal should close today or tomorrow and advise you of a related earnings recognition issue The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed DASH and works as follows at the signing of the letter agreement NW pays ENA million with another million paid on July the Turbine Deposits The balance of million is paid by NW at such time as the assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC and ENA sells the LLC member interests to NW The outside date for this to occur via a notice provided by NW is Sept The million paid by NW and the obligation to purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern Corp The only condition to NWs obligation to purchase the member interests is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC If ENA does not effect the assignment then NW would also be entitled to a return of the million in Turbine Deposits This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in January except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the date of execution of the letter agreement and the turbine contract assignment In the Intergen deal ENA did not receive any payments prior to the assignment and sale of the member interests The earnings issue raised by accounting Herman Manis is that notwithstanding NWs firm commitment to purchase ENA has two albeit very minor performance obligations First ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC we have had to do this for every turbine transaction Second ENA has to perform under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior to the time we effect the assignment we theoretically could loose our purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our agreement with NW We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are perfunctory in nature and that all income from this transaction should be recognized upon execution of the letter agreement We have further stated that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue but there is no solution to the second issue Herman advised us that to the extent we receive a letter from GE on the first issue and can convince Arthur Anderson that the second item is perfunctory in nature we could recognize all income upon execution of the letter agreement prior to the actual assignment of the turbine contract to the LLC He did not think we had a good case relative to the second issue and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson Thus based on the above in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any income form this transaction until Q While we think we have a shot at getting accounting to change their position we do not think that this outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying profitability is significant The deal is also consistent with the approved DASH We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter agreement and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized in Q vs Q Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled or if you have any other questions Regards Ben

Northwestern Deal Sounds great Enron North America Corp From Ben F Jacoby AM Sent by Ben Jacoby To Christopher F CT cc Kay nron W David CT Chris nron Subject Re Northwestern Deal Chris I have not analyzed the TurboPark deal to determine what would constitute an event of default in that deal and at the same time preclude our ability to exercise our call option Finance Accounting have not provided specific guidance on this We have spoke to GE We have advised them of the deal with Northwestern We do not believe the acknowledgement and consent will be a problem and that it will follow the same discussion process as has been going on regarding Pastoria NW does not have negotiating rights on the acknowledgement and consent They must accept it to the extent the one we receive for this deal is substantially the same as the one for Pastoria weve attached the Pastoria form to the letter agreement If NW flakes we keep the million can sue them to close and can resell the units This remote scenario would likely provide us with additional upside The only scenario that we dont get paid are the two scenarios outlined in my previous email we cannot obtain the GE acknowledgement and consent or we otherwise cannot effect the assignment because of a default in E Next NW does not have any other outs The income from the deal is expected to be at least million but could be as high as million depending on the exact closing date and potential LDs we may receive from GE Ive attached the DASH which contains an income analysis Regards Ben Christopher F Calger AM To Ben CT Kay nron cc W David CT Chris nron Subject Re Northwestern Deal Ben and Kay What is our performance obligation to ENext Have we spoken to GE re consents Is GE going to be difficult because this is the Frame division not the Lee J and the LM team Does NW have any discretion approval rights negotiating rights w respect to the assignment to the LLC If NW flakes can we keep the MM or do we have to resell and sue for any shortfall In what scenarios would we not get fully paid Assuming Sep what is the income from this deal Regards Chris Enron North America Corp From Ben F Jacoby AM Sent by Ben Jacoby To W David CT Christopher F CT cc Kay nron Chris nron Subject Northwestern Deal Dave Chris I wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern NW GE EA deal should close today or tomorrow and advise you of a related earnings recognition issue The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed DASH and works as follows at the signing of the letter agreement NW pays ENA million with another million paid on July the Turbine Deposits The balance of million is paid by NW at such time as the assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC and ENA sells the LLC member interests to NW The outside date for this to occur via a notice provided by NW is Sept The million paid by NW and the obligation to purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern Corp The only condition to NWs obligation to purchase the member interests is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC If ENA does not effect the assignment then NW would also be entitled to a return of the million in Turbine Deposits This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in January except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the date of execution of the letter agreement and the turbine contract assignment In the Intergen deal ENA did not receive any payments prior to the assignment and sale of the member interests The earnings issue raised by accounting Herman Manis is that notwithstanding NWs firm commitment to purchase ENA has two albeit very minor performance obligations First ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC we have had to do this for every turbine transaction Second ENA has to perform under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior to the time we effect the assignment we theoretically could loose our purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our agreement with NW We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are perfunctory in nature and that all income from this transaction should be recognized upon execution of the letter agreement We have further stated that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue but there is no solution to the second issue Herman advised us that to the extent we receive a letter from GE on the first issue and can convince Arthur Anderson that the second item is perfunctory in nature we could recognize all income upon execution of the letter agreement prior to the actual assignment of the turbine contract to the LLC He did not think we had a good case relative to the second issue and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson Thus based on the above in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any income form this transaction until Q While we think we have a shot at getting accounting to change their position we do not think that this outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying profitability is significant The deal is also consistent with the approved DASH We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter agreement and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized in Q vs Q Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled or if you have any other questions Regards Ben

project in exchange for a financial concession million from Duke for environmental monitoring and research Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been difficult But today as powerstarved California scrambles to find and permit new energy sources some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that money can sway even environmentalists and tip the scales too far in favor of economic development Environmentalists who signed the agreement though said that despite their concerns about the plant expansion they had little chance of stopping it especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board So they took the potentially controversial step entering into an agreement with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plants impact on the marine environment Other environmentalists though criticized that approach Duke Energys efforts to modernize the Moss Landing Power Plant resulted in mitigation payments to environmental and other groups including million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation to mitigate the plants use of seawater to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over three years to monitor heated seawater discharge in the ocean million to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over five years to monitor water quality through a program sponsored by Save Our Shores the Center for Marine Conservation the Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter Project to the Marine Mammal Center to relocate its triage center for injured animals onto power plant property million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce over years for infrastructure improvements in the Moss Landing community to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in Moss Landing for an environmental assessment for a proposed Elkhorn Slough Circle Trail If approved Duke would provide an additional endowment to maintain the trail It is very disheartening said Carolyn Nielson a retired teacher who along with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system These environmental groups have the expertise the biologists the attorneys said Nielson who has taken her case to the State Water Resources Control Board We could have been much more successful with their help But there wouldnt have been any financial reward in it for them Such criticisms are offbase according to Warner Chabot regional director for the Center for Marine Conservation a national environmental group that was among those to sign the deal He said environmentalists got the best deal possible in the current energy climate Look at whats happening with power plant approvals in California right now said Chabot referring to the states push to bring new energy sources on line The Moss Landing project which is scheduled to add megawatts in enough to serve one million homes is a key part of that energy expansion plan No money will go to the four environmental groups the Center for Marine Conservation along with Save Our Shores Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter Project It will be routed in five yearly installments of each to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation a nonprofit organization that helps support sanctuary programs including scientific research Chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board He said the money will be used to monitor the health of Elkhorn Slough a biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to Monterey Bay Not a dime comes to the Center for Marine Conservation he said Not a penny comes to me Duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been stirred by a handful of people Its a million dollars worth of water quality studies said Duke spokesman Tom Williams Our whole effort wasnt to try to buy anybody off It was designed to help increase peoples comfort level where there wasnt a comfort level The million agreement signed in November is part of a package of more than million in Duke payments to civil government and environmental groups in connection with the plant modernization The heftiest award million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation a nonprofit environmental organization was negotiated by state agencies to mitigate environmental impacts of the plant Formed in the slough foundation exists to promote the wise use and conservation of Elkhorn Slough and surrounding wetlands its Web site says However some environmentalists say the stateapproved mitigation plan is inadequate If you want to say Who did Duke roll with a big chunk of money I would say they rolled the California Energy Commission and the Regional Water Board for the price of mitigation Chabot said The agencies got bought off cheap And the environment got taken to the cleaners Dukes Williams strongly disagreed Environmental mitigation must be based on science not on buying anybody off he said That is inappropriate and we would not participate in that That suggestion is offensive to us And it should be offensive to any environmentalist Bob Haussler head of the Energy Commissions environmental protection office said the mitigation plan is biologically sound We are confident it will improve the slough ecosystem he said Madeline Clark a local businesswoman and founder of Monterey Parkway a citizens group that scrutinizes local public works projects called the recipients of Dukes payments a shopping list of government agencies environmental groups and civic organizations She was particularly critical of the million deal with environmental groups You know what bothers me Clark said Environmental groups get tons of donations Their purpose is to protect and defend the environment If a big corporation like Duke can come in and buy them off I have a real problem with that Construction began in November on Dukes project to add megawatts of natural gasfired electrical capacity to the Moss Landing plant purchased from PGE in If the expansion is finished next year as scheduled it would account for more than percent of all new generation in California in This is a big deal said Williams the Duke spokesman It will be the largest plant in California If that plant is delayed a month or two we lose the summer of And that affects not only Duke Energy but the state of California Opponents say its not the power they oppose but the plants cooling system which will pump about billion gallons of seawater each day from Moss Landing Harbor Such pumping they say will degrade Elkhorn Slough They argue for an alternative cooling system such as towers that recirculate water Basically what that plant will do is take percent of the volume of the harbor and slough run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with much of the marine life cooked and dead said Steve Shimek executive director of the Otter Project For Shimek and other environmentalists scientific studies commissioned by Duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the plants impact on the environment There was no scientific evidence that would literally point to Duke causing harm to the environment said Vicki Nichols executive director of Save Our Shores We felt we didnt have strong standing to sue Instead the environmentalists began negotiating with Duke for financial payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project The process gave me tremendous pause and great concern Nichols said I knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong thing She was right As far as Im concerned with the pricegouging going on by the energy wholesalers they are just receiving stolen goods said Clark of the citizens group Her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that Duke Energy approached Gov Gray Davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator Chabot with the Center for Marine Conservation discouraged any comparison between the two offers calling it grossly unfair and inaccurate Regardless of what was intended with the payments Nielson said they stain the process It is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical she said Shimek took a different view We convinced Duke to spend million toward monitoring that frankly five years from now could very well come back to haunt them he said Did we do the right thing I have no idea Did we try our best Yes we did

to package with the turbines and flip a la Pastoria We have strong interest in Georgia in particular and have received a written offer from FPL to purchase the development assets of Hartwell and Athens for million no equip included I would presume we would put the turbines back on the market in Q of if we do not proceed with any Florida opportunities I think the downside is approximately million per unit given that that is our effective premium being offered today but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as we have a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the

over California Plant Tom Knudson May Knight Ridder Tribune Business News KRTBN Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Days after state regulators gave Duke Energy the goahead to expand its Moss Landing Power Plant near Monterey Bay last fall documents show four environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant The four signed an agreement not to participate in any lawsuit or regulatory challenge that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial concession million from Duke for environmental monitoring and research Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been difficult But today as powerstarved California scrambles to find and permit new energy sources some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that money can sway even environmentalists and tip the scales too far in favor of economic development Environmentalists who signed the agreement though said that despite their concerns about the plant expansion they had little chance of stopping it especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board So they took the potentially controversial step entering into an agreement with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plants impact on the marine environment Other environmentalists though criticized that approach Duke Energys efforts to modernize the Moss Landing Power Plant resulted in mitigation payments to environmental and other groups including million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation to mitigate the plants use of seawater to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over three years to monitor heated seawater discharge in the ocean million to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over five years to monitor water quality through a program sponsored by Save Our Shores the Center for Marine Conservation the Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter Project to the Marine Mammal Center to relocate its triage center for injured animals onto power plant property million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce over years for infrastructure improvements in the Moss Landing community to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in Moss Landing for an environmental assessment for a proposed Elkhorn Slough Circle Trail If approved Duke would provide an additional endowment to maintain the trail It is very disheartening said Carolyn Nielson a retired teacher who along with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system These environmental groups have the expertise the biologists the attorneys said Nielson who has taken her case to the State Water Resources Control Board We could have been much more successful with their help But there wouldnt have been any financial reward in it for them Such criticisms are offbase according to Warner Chabot regional director for the Center for Marine Conservation a national environmental group that was among those to sign the deal He said environmentalists got the best deal possible in the current energy climate Look at whats happening with power plant approvals in California right now said Chabot referring to the states push to bring new energy sources on line The Moss Landing project which is scheduled to add

secret deal offering financial concessions if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator Chabot with the Center for Marine Conservation discouraged any comparison between

Roseann Gray Barbara Cc Subject Wonder if its off the balance sheet Duke Energy Environmentalists Strike Deal over California Plant Tom Knudson May Knight Ridder Tribune Business News KRTBN Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Days after state regulators gave Duke Energy the goahead to expand its Moss Landing Power Plant near Monterey Bay last fall documents show four environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant The four signed an agreement not to participate in any lawsuit or regulatory challenge that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial concession million from Duke for environmental monitoring and research Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been difficult But today as powerstarved California scrambles to find and permit new energy sources some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that money can sway even environmentalists and tip the scales too far in favor of economic development Environmentalists who signed the agreement though said that despite their concerns about the plant expansion they had little chance of stopping it especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board So they took the potentially controversial step entering into an agreement with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plants impact on the marine environment Other environmentalists though criticized that approach Duke Energys efforts to modernize the Moss Landing Power Plant resulted in mitigation payments to environmental and other groups including million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation to mitigate the plants use of seawater to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over three years to monitor heated seawater discharge in the ocean million to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over five years to monitor water quality through a program sponsored by Save Our Shores the Center for Marine Conservation the Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter Project to the Marine Mammal Center to relocate its triage center for injured animals onto power plant property million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce over years for infrastructure improvements in the Moss Landing community to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in Moss Landing for an environmental assessment for a proposed Elkhorn Slough Circle Trail If approved Duke would provide an additional endowment to maintain the trail It is very disheartening said Carolyn Nielson a retired teacher who along with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system These environmental groups have the expertise the biologists the attorneys said Nielson who has taken her case to the State Water Resources Control Board We could have been much more successful with their help But there wouldnt have been any financial reward in it for them Such criticisms are offbase according to Warner Chabot regional director for the Center for Marine Conservation a national environmental group that was among those to sign the deal He said environmentalists got the best deal possible in the current energy climate Look at whats happening with power plant approvals in California right now said Chabot referring to the states push to bring new energy sources on line The Moss Landing project which is scheduled to add megawatts in enough to serve one million homes is a key part of that energy expansion plan No money

<4773511.1075846134555.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ben.jacoby@enron.com,2001-03-31 02:33:00,Re Westinghouse DA Cc Chris I want to make you guys aware of the latest on the DA First discussions with Montana Power are starting to progress quickly They have proposed we sign a two week exclusivity agreement with them on the turbine and have agreed to pay us k Unlike the exclusive with NorthWestern this agreement will not be binding as to ultimate purchase terms It will simply provide that we dont talk to anybody else during the exclusivity period The target price for a deal with Montana which they have indicated is acceptable is million less the continuing payment obligations to Westinghouse If this deal is consummated at million the gross margin to Enron Corp should be approximately million With this in mind we have approached Westinghouse about resolving the dispute on the damaged generator Because a replacement generator is on order essentially the issue is who as between Enron and Westinghouse bears collection risk on the insurance claim associated with the generator We have proposed that we split the risk and specifically that Enron pay million for the replacement generator with insurance proceeds split with Westinghouse up to the point of recovery of our million We would also waive our LD claim as part of this deal In order to do the Montana Power deal we need to resolve this generator claim Chris Kay and I support this approach for a few reasons First it generates income for the company Second lets just say the handling of the claim by the former EECC was not stellar and the contract provided for us to manage the insurance on the unit Third while we may have a good claim for LDs under the turbine contract we may have to move into litigation mode to collect them We of course want to solicit input from both of you before we proceed too far with either Montana or Westinghouse Because of this we have written the exclusivity agreement with Montana to provide that if we cannot deliver the generator we will return the exclusivity payment The last complication as if we didnt have enough is that the transfer price deal with CALME is not finalized Louise has taken this on and is talking to them to get the deal that Janet and I proposed earlier done which essentially provides that CALME eat million of carrying costs associated with the period during which they had responsibility for the turbine Please see the emails from Louise below Please let us know if you are on board with our approach as regards Montana and Westinghouse and I will then follow up with Louise on her discussions with CALME Thanks and regards Ben Forwarded by Ben JacobyHOUECT on AM Enron North America Corp From Ben F Jacoby PM Sent by Ben Jacoby To Louise CT cc W David CT Subject Re Louise My responses The carrying costs have been capitalized and under the accounting rules will continue to be capitalized through the last payment date under the turbine contract At this time the turbine value is undetermined While we have identified one potential counterparty Montana Power we do not have a signed deal In addition we are in the middle of a contract dispute with Westinghouse regarding the damaged generator While we hope to resolve this dispute in the context of our exiting the turbine position there exists the potential of this going into litigation Janet and I proposed the deal I discussed with you to CALME in December but never got a formal response I have put in several calls to Elio Tortolero at CALME but have not heard from him for about a month He advised me at that time that he would get me a counter proposal My group has had de facto management responsibility for the unit since December This unit was initially an ENA unit but was taken by CALME David Haug I believe in December for projects they were considering I am not aware of the terms of that transfer FYI I have attached a payment schedule for the turbine Please let me know if you have any other questions Also I have attached an updated site bank map which includes our Texas site which was inadvertently left off the previous email Regards Ben Louise Kitchen AM To Ben CT cc Subject This was the response from Jim if you have all the answers already please give me a ring otherwise can you pull the answers together and then give me a ring Thanks Louise Louise I need to know two things Have the carrying costs been expensed through Jan and Is there commercial value to the turbine If there is value to the turbine then I really dont understand allocating costs to a business unit that doesnt own the turbine in order to create the illusion of a profitable transaction I also need to know on what basis and against what agreement CALME agreed to bear the carrying costs The project it supposedly related to has been dead for several years Jim
