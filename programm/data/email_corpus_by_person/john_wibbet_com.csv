weather was the warmest of any of the previous MS s I road By AM riders were lined up looking forward t o our mile journey for the day This year there was a lot of press coverage as the ride was dedicated to Maxine Mesinger Maxine a long time sufferer of MS and society columnist for the Houston Chronicle died this past yea r of complications from MS British Petroleum had riders edging out Enron as the first corporate team to go out Enron had the second start with riders and I was among one of the first people out along with the other Enron top fundraisers including Jeff Skilling CEO of Enron and two riders with MS Enron was the top fundraising team from the MS The cannon went off and I kicked into high gear I flew with the fastest riders and after about a mile I could not keep up with them I was able to maintain a speed of miles an hour crossing the Katy prairie while t he race teams that started behind us were passing me My first stop was bre ak point three miles into the ride and hour and minutes later The weather was already feeling hot and humid I replenished my water supply and continued the next miles to lunch It was hilly but we still had a tail wind I arrived at lunch at AM in Bellville TX miles from th e start I found the Enron lunch spot with our catered lunch After a quick lunch I headed up to Industry TX population which doe s not appreciate riders going though their small town You need to make sure you stop at the one stop sign in town or you will get a ticket Luckily there was a police officer directing traffic as there was at almo st all intersections along the route of country roads I made my third stop of the day in Industry at breakpoint five where I had to stretch The hills were getting harder and the tail wind was now a crosswind Coming up on breakpoint seven miles on route a truck and crosswind almost blew t he bikes off the road The sign said it was now miles to the finish of t he day The next miles were fine but it was an additional miles to th e finish with hills and a strong head wind Last year I upgraded to a new bike with a triple I was able to keep a sl ow but steady pace up the hills by getting into the granny gear I arrived i n La Grange TX at PM hours and minutes later to many cheering supporters I was done for Day I headed over to the Enron tent the largest tent in La Grange After checking in I gulped two large bottles of ice water and signedin for a massage Enron had massage therapists working to sooth the tired and weary riders After my massage I felt totally relaxed Ilene found me in the Enron tent having a beer It took Ilene about an hour to find me sin ce our cell phones did not work well in La Grange due to limited cell capacity Every year Enron has a large barbeque in the Enron tent and thi s year the food was even better While in the tent I was talking to some other Enron riders and I learned that some came in as early as AM The next morning at AM it was time to get up Ilene and I arrived at the fairgrounds at AM I headed over to hydration station to refill my water bottles and stretched before the AM start I was one of the fir st people in line At exactly AM we were let out normally we are delayed for fog It was warmer than the day before and we had more hills ahead of us The first miles were relatively uneventful except I was able to carry o n minute conversation with Jeff Skilling CEO of Enron Then came the downhill where you can reach speeds over mph without trying the park i s now only miles away The park has a very hilly curvy and dangerous route lasting miles I stopped right inside the park to refill water and get some snacks I was really glad that I had the new bike with the triple as I was able to get up hills with little effort while others were struggling or walking their bikes That was until killer hill which I d id not remember being too difficult After the downhill there was the uphill I tried to shift into that wonderful granny gear but it was too late I noticed the pedaling was extremely easy and I was slowing almost to a stop I looked down at my chain and it jumped off the gear I yelled oh no I was able to get my foot out and prevent myself from falling The hill I fell on years past was easy I headed out of the park to lunch at the mile point it was AM When I pulled into lunch I saw Ilene who was working the lunch she was very happy to see me and I was happy to see her I took a short break and headed out to Austin After lunch the cloud cover was gone and it was hot I stopped twice in the remaining miles for water The last miles were into the wind or with a very strong cross wind At approximately PM five hours and thirty minutes later I pulled into the finish line with many supporters cheering the riders on I saw Ilene several minutes after I arrived I w as elated that I completed the mile ride from Houston to Austin for the th time and now I was ready for a beer or two and some lunch This years ride was magnificent It was a real pleasure to see seve ral people with MS ride the bike tour The law enforcement personnel directing traffic was helpful as they kept safe and us moving The support staff and volunteers that provided water and food at breakpoints and lunch were awesome Not to mention Ilene supporting me all the way to Austin I wou ld also like to thank my donors that have helped me raise over for MS and I am still counting I would like to see this number reach towards a cure for MS If you still would like your contribution to help send a check by May i t should be made out to the National MS Society and sent to the address belo w or drop it by A in the Enron building John Norden Castle Ct Pl Houston TX Thanks again for your support John Norden
