<24935857.1075845015460.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,randy.young@enron.com,2000-11-30 02:31:00,SA Legal Organization Cc Unfortunately I have been completely buried on the LDC sale process but I finally had the opportunity to speak with Bruce Lundstrom a couple of nights ago regarding the tentative plans for the South American legal organization As I told Bruce I really had not had the opportunity to think very much about the proposed structure and wanted to give it some more thought before formulating a final opinion Given the differences in our time zones these days I thought it might be better to send you this email rather than trying to catch you by phone Bruce indicated that you wanted to keep the SA legal group integrated so that services can be dispensed to the various business functions without being allocated specifically to the various business units operating within the region As you and I discussed a couple of weeks ago I agree with this socalled Enron Europe Model approach It seems to me to be the best way to maximize group cohesiveness improve the budgeting and fee monitoring process facilitate recruiting and maintain regional legal expertise and core competencies Bruce also wanted my thoughts on the idea of having this group report into the Global Asset group general counsel rather than to you directly As I told Bruce I have absolutely no problem personally in reporting into him if that is whats finally decided The only thing I wanted to think about was whether the structure makes sense given the nature of the region and its legal activities That said and after thinking through it I do have some concerns about moving the group one step down the ladder within your organization actually since the group currently reports into the Enron Corp Office of the General Counsel I guess it would be moving down at least two rungs Regardless of whether I or in the longerterm someone else is the general counsel of this regional legal group I would suggest that you have it report into you directly rather than through any one business unit First this is a large group the largest of the old EI groups covering a big geographic area Even after the Gas LDCs and Elektro are sold the South American legal group will still have a total of lawyers Enron lawyers counting in Houston in Sao Paulo in Rio in BA and at Vengas in Caracas since Vengas is effectively controlled by Enron and other lawyers within the groups supervisory responsibility at Promigas TGS Transredes and Cuiaba currently a vacancy following Ann Birosels departure In all we have individual legal groups located in eight different cities in Brazil Argentina Bolivia Colombia and Venezuela Second the group covers a lot of different areas of activity much of which is unrelated to the Global Asset function As I told Bruce most of the senior Enron lawyers in the group are focused on supporting the origination functions for the region I understand these functions will continue on the business side under Joe Kishkill Orlando Gonzalez and Brett Wiggs who will report to Delaney Lavorato and not to McDonaldHughes The major assets are operated within the joint venture companies TGS Transredes Cuiaba BBPL Vengas almost all of which have legal groups that work closely with Enrons As asset sales efforts are expected to increase and we are expected to start construction on two power projects in Brazil I told Bruce that I would recommend that one or two of the gas unit lawyers certainly Vicky Martinez and maybe Paula Porto be moved to focus on the the Global Asset management function to give it more transactional flexibility and native Portuguese language capability Subject to whatever is ultimately decided about the BA office I assume the trading function will also continue to exist within the region and that the trading lawyers will continue to be represented there as well None of this is to suggest that these groups of lawyers should be permanently assigned to particular functions and not made available for other functions It just doesnt seem to me to be very practical functionally to have these origination and deal activities reporting into you through the one side of Enron Wholesale that is not directly related to the origination trading and other deal side of the business Bruce explained to me that he was concerned that good lawyers would be picked off by other business groups and not available to work on the asset side of the business and that this somehow partially justified moving all the lawyers underneath the Global Asset group at least initially I am not sure I fully understand the logic of that but to be fair to Bruce it was late here and I might have been a little slow It seems to me however that the Enron Europe Model handled that pretty well by having all of the lawyers available for work in different areas as the need arises and by having the regional general counsel perform the role of the honest broker in allocating attorneys to the different constituencies I really dont see the need to do something radically different in South America especially given the obvious comparisons between the two regions Third I think the business guys might question the reporting structure One of the advantages of the Enron Europe Model as I appreciate it is that it allows the general counsel to allocate scarce legal resources without the appearance of unfairness or favoritism It may not be so easy to explain to one of the origination folks why the lawyer they want to use is unavailable and committed to a project on the asset side without appearing impartial when he knows the general counsel reports to the asset side of the business and not the deal side It just seems to me to invite unnecessary friction going forward Fourth aside from appearances I think there is an advantage in ultimately having the staffing and legal support priorities for the region set at a level that has some distance from the often competing interests of the individual components of the separate business lines If there is a hard call to be made in allocating resources between Global Assets and the origination functions it is just going to be easier for the decision to be made by the regional counsel in direct consultation with you based on your understanding of Mark Frieverts priorities than it would be to expect Bruce or any other business group general counsel similarly situated to tell their respective business group heads that they cant have the attorneys they want because another business group needs them more or has a more important or strategic priority Finally given the breadth of what is expected to go on down here and the number of lawyers and countries involved I would think you would want to receive your reports directly from the regional general counsel rather than through any one of the other business group general counsels That is not to say that Bruce or anyone else would not be able to report things without unduly filtering them but to some extent that happens naturally as a reporting structure becomes more heirarchical I know that a balance needs to be struck between having too many direct reports on the one hand and reducing the quality of information flowing up to you on the other For what it is worth however I would suggest that you strike the balance in this case in favor of direct reporting Plus it seems to be working fine in Europe if that is to be the paradigm As I said I will go with whatever is finally decided but I thought I should at least give you my thoughts on the issue If you want to discuss it further please feel free to give me a call I should be back in Houston next week for a while at least Hope all is well and I look forward to seeing you again soon Regards Randy
