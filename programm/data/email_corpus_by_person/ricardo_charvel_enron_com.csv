<27000596.1075846144454.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ricardo.charvel@enron.com,1999-12-02 07:29:00,Re World Bank energy reportHere are some thoughts on why I think this is important sorry for the length Political One of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its benefits for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy policy Subsidies should be focused to the consumer In general electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized If there is a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government finances that is if you do not raise the rates for the residential users especially for the poor In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they plan to do with the subsidies but if they make a mistake it will become a social problem I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the advice of economic experts Economic Another way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local economy Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower inflation rate A growing industry creates more employment Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back of the governments finance The government could then re direct resources that it would have invested in the energy sector or use resources from the sale of assets to develop water infrastructure pay foreign debt give micro credits build roads improve health and education Social development poverty There are another aspects that are directly related to the availability of energy services for the poor heating and cooking and water Although most of the developing world has tropical or semi tropical weather and is less subjected to cold weather hot weather generally will not kill you they have some heating needs apart from the energy for cooking needs It is frequent that dung is used as fuel for heating and cooking purposes with terrible effects on health which in turn results in lower productivity etc The available alternative to dung is wood and here the problem is even worse because these poor communities end up causing irreversible damage to the forests and then to the soil and finally to their water resources since the forest sustains the soil and prevents water from causing erosion When the forest dissapears water is not filtered down to natural storages underground As you can see its a mess One other extremely important aspect of the availability of energy for the poor is that it enables them to have potable water delivered as close as possible to their communities In the poorest communities little girls do not go to school because they have to carry the water buckets home They do not get an education The terrible thing about it is that the education level of the mother is what can have a highest impact in the quality of life of a poor family This is very sad and energy plays a huge part in the solution A lot could be researched and written on this matters and about the role of energy in the solution of these problems Can we help Do we have the resources that need to be commited to at least one of these aspects Which one do you think will have the highest impact Best Ricardo

the positive impact of finally having a change in the party in power after years is beyond our forecast ability At last we are going to have more checks and balances in the system with all the benefits that they will bring to the country to a more democratic way of doing things Also with the checks and balances everybody will have to listen respect and negotiate with others Its going to be fun For us it means A couple of weeks ago I had a meeting with a key Fox advisor and we will have the opportunity to participate in the design of their energy policies and as you rememberlast year I worked closely with a group of PAN legislators close to Fox in helping them draft aan alternative proposal for the reform of the electric sector The unions did not vote for the PAN and they are the main stronghold against energy reform The PAN has no compromise with the unions Industrials have backed the PAN and since yesterday energy reform has been on Foxs agenda He said he would not sell assets but that he would open the industry to private investment You have to start somewhere We should work very hard this summer and try to participate in the National Development Plan which is a government plan that the new administration is obligated by law to create and publicize I will offer of my time to help them develop the energy part tof the plan There are rumors that our friend Luis Tellez is staying as well as some of his undersectretaries Hopefully Hector Olea will stay at the CRE as well In the medium term we could see lower interest rates for the Mexican economy Since Sunday they are down more than percentage points to around Hopefully in a couple of yeares we should be well below the mark depending also on the US rates In short all is well south of your border The long transition to democracy is over Best Ricardo Steven J ES PM To Ricardo nron cc Subject Mexico II Wrong and Proud of It What do you think these electiion results are going to mean for us Are you happy for Mexico Forwarded by Steven J KeanHOUEES on PM Michelle Michot Foss HEDU on PM To HEDU cc Subject Mexico II Wrong and Proud of It Dear colleagues if bad predictions lead to contrary but more positive results then I take full blame Clearly we underestimated the power of the opportunity to vote in private in Mexico yesterday with a vote that actually mattered We overestimated the vestigial effects of the PRI machine Early reactions from our advisors and research colleagues in Mexico are strongly favorable there is considerable Fox support among the group and one of our advisory board members may return to active duty in the Fox administration Their reactions are tempered with cautions The vote margin is indeed likely to narrow as final returns especially from rural and southern

Ricardo Original Message From Balmaceda Andres SentFriday August PM ToCharvel Ricardo SubjectFW Comments Compilation The comments are below They are also in the attached word document below Thank you to the people who took the time and energy to step up and respo nd We had a high response rate Everyone is not going to agree with all the comments but Billy is going to get them exactly the way they were written The note is long consider pr inting it Vikas Comments from MBA Class We need to reconcile the difference between ENEs salaries vs competit ors and other Houston companies We need better guidance in the rotation selection Ive seen lot of go od people being screwed because choosing a bad area to work due to lack of information Regardless of whether you like your rotation or not the Program itsel f is staffed in a very amateur manner There are a few really good people but for the most part it is just not professionally run Calls unanswered lots of passing the buck and general disorganization If they have resources they do a poor job of communicating them Whi le we do have a responsibility to find info ourselves there should be an a ctive effort to point us to those resources Compensation The bonus part is certainly not communicated as being l ocked into a fixed range and independent of business unit performance At the very least this is a serious oversight PRC Really doesnt work Not an apple to apples comparison Heavil y dependent on whenwhere you rotated I could care less about Enrons reputation I tried paying my student loans with reputation but they only accepted cash How much money can I make at this place assuming the stock price doesnt double every few month s in effect preventing Enron from getting the public equity markets to pay my compensation Also there has been a significant change on the acceptable cut in term s of the PRC where before Enron was penalizing the have issues classific ation of the PRC now it feels like they are trying to get rid of of th e pool Reinforcing the first paragraph Offer of salary is cloaked and we dont know where we can end up I believe there is a big disconnect between recruiting team and the h ead office As a result the sales pitch given to recruits leads to false e xpectations And obviously when those expectations are not met we all know the consequences The rest of the downtown Houston Energy concerns are paying much high er base Can we have a list of companies we benchmark compensation against I s it really Wall Street and consulting If so Id like to see the names o f the firms New York is not that expensive that the well theyre in New York excuse covers all discrepancies It feels like we must be benchmarki ng against second or third tier MBA recruiters Theres a feeling among the Associate pool that you need to be in a s ecure established money making division in order to guarantee a average o r above PRC for the end of the year and therefore not be in the two bottom brackets and not be fired That goes against the long term reputation of Enron as a company where you are rewarded for taking risks Attempting to get into rotation and expect competition from others ro tating but do not expect to get displaced by a st rotation associate that is placed by the AA pool Assignment of st rotation was chosen for me and the job function was more of an analyst function than it was an associate function Why cant alumni from your school help to find a rotation to match the desires of the in coming candidate Manage expectationsdont need to hear about year old trader and Louise Kitchens rise to fame with Enron Onlinecreates an expectation t hat those are more common occurrences than they really are It doesnt feel like theres a lot to do in all areas nonetheless so mething between and new associates coming in these fall First why that many Second do they know what they are getting into The main issues have to do with compensation being well below market we have always been assured that the bonus and options more than made up for the disparity but given the declining stock value lack of meaningful rotations and decrease in the overall level of satisfaction with the progra m this is becoming a much bigger issue Enron is so secretive about salaries that Associates have no idea wha t the upside looks like Working for beans in year is ok if years ar e excellent We really have no idea what to expect for salary or bonus aft er the program is over Salary well below market base salary and value of optionsbonus e ven if they bring us up to the offers which are rumored to be under m arket we have year or more experience with the class coming in and will be paid the same amount Lack of quality rotations cuts in EBS EES ect Level of responsibility is well below expectationsmaturity level Compensation for Associates is at the bottom of the pay scale for Top BSchools Not only in comparison to IB and Consulting but also compared to specialties brand management etc that are at the lower end of the M BA scale It is cheaper to live in Houston but our student loans are not i ndexed by location Other energy companies here in town even pay more The Enron contract is designed to retain employees with sticks and no t carrots There is no other company I know that expects full repayment of a signing bonus months after the start date If the Program is truly s pecial people should not be forced to repay anythingEnron should deliver w hat they advertise and people will stay The month lock up period sugge sts a concern with retention that is being met with a penalty to the Associ ate and not an improvement in the Program How much do managers make assuming certain business and individual pe rformance levels Ive got no clue but Im wondering why it such a big sec ret The PRC process does not encourage people to experiment in their rota tions as Enron implies For example if you take a rotation in an area you know nothing about you will lose in the PRC because you are still learnin g the job Similarly if you were a trader and go to a trading rotation y ou will be rewarded a PRC time There are too many associates and too few analysts Too many associ ate rotations become exercises in finding something to do Too often asso ciates think to themselves I remember doing this several years ago as an u ndergrad why am I doing this again They should present the program for what it is an internal labor poo l where Associates find their own rotations depending on what is available and who they know The Program does not match people with jobs and should make it clear that you will be interviewing for jobs etc upon entry into t he program This is not because they want Associates to have choice but r ather because they have no proven record of placing people in the rotations If we are not going to be competitive with Wall Street and consulting we should at least be competitive with our energy competitors I dont k now what companies we are benchmarking against but I guarantee we are not k eeping up Small differences can create a lot animosity towards the progra m When a person who didnt get into Enron but got into a competitor makes materially more money from the start people start believing they have jus t been sold a lot of hype Not enough development during rotations even associates who end up learning a lot dont necessarily enjoy their rotations because they dont f eel part of the team Not getting to pick your rotations or at least interview for your fir st rotation is a moral buster as well Additionally it can waste a lot of time in the case that someone is forced into a group or position they have no interest in Compensation many gave up lucrative offers elsewhere for a lower ba se and bonus package from Enron because the stock price movement promised l arge equity based compensation Also it was very difficult to find out wh at full first year bonuses were during the recruiting process Most wrongl y believed that this indicated that the bonuses were competitive versus oth er leading MBA avenues How much money do people at Enron make assuming th e stock price performs Great Okay Poor Responsibility when you are getting recruited you always here the L ouise Kitchen John Arnold and Greg Whalley examples as if that is normal We need to stop doing that Enrons slowing growth rate and failure in e verything outside of gas and power trading will super fast promotions as we look more and more like a large corporation The program is designed to bring in too many associates and then let them compete with each other until the weaker associates are driven out I f this is true why not spend more time and money recruiting and bring in f ewer higher quality associates from the start the process of weeding out leaves everyone with a bad feeling More importantly you probably lose m ore good people then you realize Trading trading trading On MBA campus visits Enron gives the imp ression that there are lots of corporate development MA finance and ot her similar assignments available at Enron The reality seems that if you are not interested in trading for a living you are not on the companys ma in commercial track any longer Finding a Rotation Information difficult to get it is all networkin g This is fine but I dont consider the AA progrram a resource in this a rea at all If no one else does we should cut any expenses they are incurr ing for rotation placement The skew on associate bonuses hurts morale You can reward the high performers without penalizing the good performers Recently the word has gotten around that the top and the next of the PRC group got very large bonuses while everyone below that level got very poor bonuses This distribution creates a small number of very happy people and a larger numb er of unhappy people I find it interesting that Enron chooses to adopt a business mode l based upon freemarket economics and pride itself on its intellectual capital in an era in which the company moves toward being a financial serv ices player rather than a firm with a tremendous physical presence In sel ecting an employer this was a HUGE selling point I find it paradoxical h owever that we have chosen to adopt a pay grade that could at best be desc ribed as socialistic and below market In a labor market where intellectu al capital is portable and our chief competitors have seen our competitive advantage in the form of this asset I can only believe that Enron is posit ioning itself to fall short in the years to come when J Aron Morgan Stanl ey Dynegy El Paso etc decide that the cheapest way to gain ground on En ron is to higher this intellectual capital Without griping I feel if not hing else workers at Enron would like to be paid market rate for the talen ts we possess In our sales pitch we are told that Enron benchmarks pay against our energy competitors as well as comparable jobs on Wall Street I can say from experience that our compensation packages cannot hold a cand le to the potential for a Wall Street style pay package which leaves me bi tter that the sales pitch was shallow fell short or was deliberately misg uided Part of the problem from an Associates perspective stems from Enr on promising the moon and then falling short on delivery Like a company t hat fails to deliver on earnings in a tough market punishment for such a s hortfall is swift and severe I truly believe Enron is setting itself up f or such a fall unless this matter is addressed swiftly In an extension of the contradiction between free market economics an d socialistic patronage I have come to notice that more and more departmen ts are positioning themselves to hire Associates under the guise that the A ssociate promise to stay more than the required and desired six months Fu rther many desks once happy with the performance of the Associate ask fo r the option to retain the Associate However no effort is made to comp ensate the Associate for essentially giving up the optionality embedded i n a rotational program In fact many choosing to stay within a group have made their experiences explicitly known to others that come PRC time they have actually been slighted for cutting short their rotation and instead o pting to join a unit full time By removing the ability of business units to promote a worker until conclusion of the month period hard workin g goodfit Associates miss the opportunity to capitalize on what would see m to be a natural fit for a fulltime position and the chance to alleviate a significant source of discontentCOMPENSATION which could be addressed through the immediate promotion to the Manager level By allowing for prom otion Associates could earn enhanced compensation and department heads co uld address hiring needs Rather Associates leave a unit disgruntled fee ling they are marking time in other units potentially passing up an altern ative that may be of great interest Additionally a number of Commercial units have even gone so far as refusing to hire Associates unless they are in their third or fourth rotation so as to retain a call option on an em ployee that has run out of rotation alternatives This practice CANNOT be in the best interest of the Desks the Program or for that matter Enron By pigeonholing employees in this matter the significance and importance o f rotations is greatly diminished as is our work experience This is just ludicrous Department heads arent looking to hire externally because of the salary shortfall and our forced pay grade Rather they are trying to plug a Manager level position with an Associate salary Again rather than pay a competitive performancebased wage Enron has adopted a tightfiste d socialistic pay grade to better serve expenses Ultimately this will l ead to people seeking to rotate out of Enron for the compensation the mar ket will bare I think AA provides an excellent opportunity to find the department that you would like to work in through rotations and if you do a good job chances of advancing are much better for analysts and associates than for regular employees We get solid commercial responsibility from the get go I doubt many of the guys who went to NY had this We get lots of freedom to manage my own business as long as I produce Salaries Not in line with market Mentors Not encouraged throughout the organization Recruiting Disorganized not enough student focus trying to compete with the IBanks but not willing to offer the salaries sometimes unprofess ional conduct rejection letters to students contained spelling errors and gave message you are not good enough Summer Intern Program Not well coordinated Rotation Length Keep flexibility mos sometimes too short other t imes too long disincents management to include Associates in longer term meatier projects When is the issue of salary increases going to be revisited Overall Enron has a great group of people to work with Enron has an excellent diversity of backgrounds ethnicity and natio nalities within the company Enron has an excellent overall atmosphere Overall Enron has an excellent overall company image I do not have too many comments My main problem with the last team w as that they were extremely rigid rigid start date rigidity in assigning groups etc Old group did oneway dialogues they would not even listen The new group appears flexible and is willing to listen these are two thi ngs I feel are most important in running such program Three months ago I talked with Althea Gordon about a couple of friend s that graduated with me from my business school They wanted still want to work for Enron I sent her their resumes and am still waiting for a res ponse I believe she left Enron I then contacted Patricia Payton Several emails phone calls and still havent heard from her Its frustrating dea ling with the HR dept PRC is not a trusted mechanism Few people in the program understand it fully no one knows exactly what occurs in the meetings and no one bel ieves the results are truly equitable Politics appears to play as much of a role as performance if not more so in determining rankings Further groups are not obligated to tell people in the pool where they ultimately r anked people For as much as individuals success depends upon this rankin g and for as open and honest as the process is supposed to be that policy is incredibly inconsistent We are under market for compensation everyone knows this regardles s of what the program people say It is common knowledge that at least Rel iant and El Paso are paying their program participants more in salary and b onus The decision to increase sign on bonuses and not salaries to incomin g participants slighted existing program members by keeping our salaries fl at and was not well received obviously Rotation placement service is not very useful The best way to find a good rotation remains through networking The experience talent and character of the associate pool continue to be excellent Cooperation and support within the associate class is very good with virtually no known instances of undermining or backstabbing Comeraderie a mong the class is widespread and genuine The efforts to solicit feedback and foster communication by the new A A program administration is appreciated and a positive step in the right d irection Historically there has been at best a poor effort to both maintain in ternal communication and networking within each associate class and to crea te new networks between individual associate classes Efforts by individua l associates to affect this have not been supported Mixers with business unit management should be continuously offered particularly as rotation time approaches This would facilitate informal d iscussion about opportunities and business unit activity Additionally it would be a good format for associates to exchange information on their rota tions and introduce those interested to potential future managers Compensation is clearly an issue Whether the compensation gap exist s in reality or it only exists in perception there is a widespread belief that Enron is undercompensating associates relative to both other firms in the industry and to a broader set of companies where the same skill sets a re employed This is exasperated by the collapsing stock price and severel y underwater options Base salary should be addressed Again whether perception or reality associates are concerned about selecting rotations in groups that are not making money The belief is tha t bonus levels rise and fall with the profitability of business units The refore it is an extreme disincentive to rotate through an unprofitable gro up regardless of the skill development it may offer The mandatory eighteenmonth service period before eligibility for pr omotion is arbitrary and penalizes the best performers What happened to the AA publication There is no source available that provides a history of individual as sociates who have rotated through specific jobs It would be very benefici al to have a directory of associates who could be contacted for firsthand information on business units of interest My assessment of the program thus far is that I think there are a lot of instances where the interviewing group is not upfront about the respons ibilities that they plan to assign to the Associates before they get into t he group Once in I know of several people including myself that get a wh ole lot of very ridiculous work that was not a part of the set expectations prior to joining that group Furthermore I believe that Associates get w ork that is more suitable for a clerk than for someone with a graduate degr ee This is very frustrating because once your in your in and you cant g et out for months On top of that you get PRC reviews based on work tha t was not challenging and I do not believe that a fair and equitable assess ment can be made Now I understand that this line of thinking does not apply to everyon e But the point is that much of this would never happen if people were up front with their expectations prior to hiring on an Associate In addition it bothers me that Associates are many times treated very very poorly by their new groups This has not been the case for me but I know people th at have voiced these thoughts and opinions so I am speaking for them inca se they are too nervous to put it into writing That is about it I would like to see some education come out of the Associate Program as to new groups that start within Enron as well as som e greater insight to particular groups and the expectations When Enron recruited us it was so different from what it is now So many diverse opportunities were out there Now Enron is heading towards a pure trading house It is getting harder and harder to get a decent rota tion out of trading But you dont need an MBA to be a trader In fact A ssociates often work for analysts on the trading side and we dont have an y special attention or cultivation from management to progress on the tradi ng side It is not a surprise some of us are thinking about getting the n ext rotation at El Paso A lot of business units think Associates come and go too quickly and six months is not enough for us to climb up the learning curve first and then make meaningful contributions Some people think it is worthwhile to groom Associates even less worthwhile than to cultivate Analysts who are supposed to be there longer It is sometimes difficult for Associates to g et meaningful assignments if management holds such a perception against us Compensation level needs to be adjusted to match up with our competit ors The companys direction has changed drastically from the one I interv iewed for in November some of these strategies seem shortsighted and in my opinion could make it more difficult for the company to compete in th e energy business in the long term specifically The stated strategy of exiting all generation exploration and trans portation assets in my mind endangers the competitive position of the compa ny and earns us a banking multiple on the street Also with additional pl ayers entering the gas and power markets in a major way how can we expect to continue to grow and maintain our current market share Along with our success there have been many failed business ventures including Azurix Enron International Dabhol EBS and EES The failures of EES and EBS have still not been fully resolved and appear to have not b een totally priced in to our stock price Bottom line there does not appe ar to be any large areas of growth within the company Pay When the firms right up the street offers you anywhere from to dollars more to do the same job it doesnt make you feel very intelligent to be working here Additionally when I accepted this positi on I was never told and have yet to be told what the official limits on and what the determinants are of the annual bonus What I have heard through the grapevine is that it is significantly lower than what I was led to beli eve during recruiting Not having any assistance and having attended a top East coast school I am almost dollars in debt I was counting o n the annual bonus to allow me to remove this albatross from around my neck but in reality after my debt service I am barely better off than when I w orked as an engineer in manufacturing I dont see much difference in the kind of assignments between Analys ts and Associates It seems unfair for Analysts since they get lower salari es but it is also a waste of years of experience in the case of Associat es It is probably the number of Associates hired every year through the P rogram gives the idea of a cheap resource for the business units Be certai n the position requires some degree of expertise before assigning an Associ ate If you look at AA as human capital we at Enron are very long in bac kground experience and knowledge The AA Program is Regulation using En ron terminology from rotation assignments to payments I see pretty logic al the consequences a lot of inefficiencies waste of energy the lack of objectivity poor motivation or even frustration in general performance is far away from excellent Add some flexibility to the Program let the peop le choose their rotations and move without restrictions Let them also nego tiate working conditions salaries and career path with the business unit PRC is unfair I consider offensive writing in a maximum of lines months of accomplishments I dont think a PRC Committee can better assess the performance than the business unit degree evaluations and peers review are ok Rethink the need of a committee and a ranking of AA assig ned to so different business units I feel free to choose for a second rotation I like the way you can a pproach a new business unit introduce yourself have an interview and gath ered information about the business and your position Things may change af ter that and you get stacked in that place for at least months Keep allo wing people to search and move freely from HR Make staff more accountable Online based Much like the IT departm ent where when I call it initiates a request that I must approval closure of with any comments Tell people up front that bonuses are pretty fixed until you make Man ager Not communicated at all Tell people that their first rotations are assigned Also not commun icated I wish I had a PRC suggestion but I need to think about it Dont insult my intelligence by giving incoming Associates more money but putting it in a bonus so you dont have to give us raises If you wan t to do that give me the courtesy of being up front about it Some kind of database maybe there is one that I dont know about of openings Would be pretty cool Raise compensation so it is at a premium to our competitors at the least so it is equal Make the development and support of associates a more important crite rion in the PRC process for both directors and Vice Presidents The commer cial stress is so high right now that development is ignored completely Reduce the size of each incoming class make the program special aga in Right now I cant believe the broad spread in ability and experience in the associate class I guarantee the spread is not that high in other t op tier firms that hire MBAs With the smaller size assign a lead commercial person to a group of associates The lead commercial person a director or VP would keep in touch with and help out his group of associates to make sure they make the most of their rotations and Enron gets the most out of them Make sure the program stays in touch with commercial groups so these groups know when they need a clerk analyst or associate Too often we tr eat analysts clerks and yearold associates with years of experien ce the same This happens way too much The program should work with the incoming associates a little closer to help them understand what kinds of job or what kind of career path they want to take and design a plan on how to get them there

the positive impact of finally having a change in the party in power after years is beyond our forecast ability At last we are going to have more checks and balances in the system with all the benefits that they will bring to the country to a more democratic way of doing things Also with the checks and balances everybody will have to listen respect and negotiate with others Its going to be fun For us it means A couple of weeks ago I had a meeting with a key Fox advisor and we will have the opportunity to participate in the design of their energy policies and as you rememberlast year I worked closely with a group of PAN legislators close to Fox in helping them draft aan alternative proposal for the reform of the electric sector The unions did not vote for the PAN and they are the main stronghold against energy reform The PAN has no compromise with the unions Industrials have backed the PAN and since yesterday energy reform has been on Foxs agenda He said he would not sell assets but that he would open the industry to private investment You have to start somewhere We should work very hard this summer and try to participate in the National Development Plan which is a government plan that the new administration is obligated by law to create and publicize I will offer of my time to help them develop the energy part tof the plan There are rumors that our friend Luis Tellez is staying as well as some of his undersectretaries Hopefully Hector Olea will stay at the CRE as well In the medium term we could see lower interest rates for the Mexican economy Since Sunday they are down more than percentage points to around Hopefully in a couple of yeares we should be well below the mark depending also on the US rates In short all is well south of your border The long

positive results then I take full blame Clearly we underestimated the power of the opportunity to vote in private in Mexico yesterday with a vote that actually mattered We overestimated the vestigial effects of the PRI machine Early reactions from our advisors and research colleagues in Mexico are strongly favorable there is considerable Fox support among the group and one of our advisory board members may return to active duty in the Fox administration Their reactions are tempered with cautions The vote margin is indeed likely to narrow as final returns especially from rural and southern states with heavy PRI or PRD influence are produced today It is still viewed as unlikely that Fox will have much to work with in the Congress as the PRI majority rule is unlikely to fall to the PAN But well see After the excitement comes the problem of governance Could Fox face the problem that Germany faced after WWII or the FSU after break up The knowledge and experience regarding federal affairs lies with those who served during the Salinas and Zedillo administrations and thus who are associated with PRI governance What appointments are likely to be made as a consequence With no formal civil service what bumps are likely to be felt in this historic transition On the issue of decentralization that I raised last week the betting is that Fox as a former governor will indeed preside over a transfer of some and perhaps considerable power and fiscal authority from federal to state jurisdictions On the housecleaning wish list we can now add an item that Labastida would have been unlikely to pursue a vigorous effort to commercialize but not privatize the national energy companies Unless there are surprises in the final vote tallies today and this could happen the feeling

benefits that they will bring to the country to a more democratic way of doing things Also with the checks and balances everybody will have to listen respect and negotiate with others Its going to be fun For us it means A couple of weeks ago I had a meeting with a key Fox advisor and we will have the opportunity to participate in the design of their energy policies and as you rememberlast year I worked closely with a group of PAN legislators close to Fox in helping them draft aan alternative proposal for the reform of the electric sector The unions did not vote for the PAN and they are the main stronghold against energy reform The PAN has no compromise with the unions Industrials have backed the PAN and since yesterday energy reform has been on Foxs agenda He said he would not sell assets but that he would open the industry to private investment You have to start somewhere We should work very hard this summer and try to participate in the National Development Plan which is a government plan that the new administration is obligated by law to create and publicize I will offer of my time to help them develop the energy part tof the plan There are rumors that our friend Luis Tellez is staying as well as some of his undersectretaries Hopefully Hector Olea will stay at the CRE as well In the medium term we could see lower interest rates for the Mexican economy Since Sunday they are down more than percentage points to around Hopefully in a couple of yeares we should be well below the mark depending also on the US rates In short all is well south of your border The long transition to democracy is over Best Ricardo Steven J ES PM To Ricardo nron cc Subject Mexico II Wrong and Proud of It What do you think these electiion results are going to mean for us Are you happy for Mexico Forwarded by Steven J KeanHOUEES on PM Michelle Michot Foss HEDU on PM To HEDU cc Subject Mexico II Wrong and Proud of It Dear colleagues if bad predictions lead to contrary but more positive results then I take full blame Clearly we underestimated the power of the opportunity to vote in private in Mexico yesterday with a vote that actually mattered We overestimated the vestigial effects of the PRI machine Early reactions from our advisors and research colleagues in Mexico are strongly favorable there is considerable Fox support among the group and one of our advisory board members may return to active duty in the Fox administration Their reactions are tempered with cautions The vote margin is indeed likely to narrow as final returns especially from rural and southern states with heavy PRI or PRD influence are produced today It is still viewed as unlikely that Fox will have much to work with in the Congress as the PRI majority rule is unlikely to fall to the PAN But well see After the excitement comes the problem of governance Could Fox face the problem that Germany faced after WWII or the FSU after break up The knowledge and experience regarding federal affairs lies with those who served during the Salinas and Zedillo administrations and thus who are associated with PRI governance What appointments are likely to be made as a consequence With no formal civil service what bumps are likely to be felt in this historic transition On the issue of decentralization that I raised last week the betting is that Fox as a former governor will indeed preside over a transfer of some and perhaps considerable power and fiscal authority from federal to state jurisdictions On the housecleaning wish list we can now add an item that Labastida would have been unlikely to pursue a vigorous effort to commercialize but not privatize the national energy companies Unless there are surprises in the final vote tallies today and this could happen the feeling is that Fox will still be bound by campaign rhetoric and limited by lack of a PAN majority in Congress But even if the attention these next six years were on getting things in order improved financial and accounting practices establishing better capital budgeting processes with the PRIPemex bond now broken this longtime goal for Pemex could be realized increasing transparency for operations upgrading management skills and resolving environmental problems and disputes with landowners and state governments that would be a major improvement But this will entail a major effort and significant culture shift within CFE and Pemex Certainly our malaise regarding our Mexico case study has lifted Our activities for the remainder of the year should be quite exciting Michelle Michot

the positive impact of finally having a change in the party in power after years is beyond our forecast ability At last we are going to have more checks and balances in the system with all the benefits that they will bring to the country to a more democratic way of doing things Also with the checks and balances everybody will have to listen respect and negotiate with others Its going to be fun For us it means A couple of weeks ago I had a meeting with a key Fox advisor and we will have the opportunity to participate in the design of their energy policies and as you rememberlast year I worked closely with a group of PAN legislators close to Fox in helping them draft aan alternative proposal for the reform of the electric sector The unions did not vote for the PAN and they are the main stronghold against energy reform The PAN has no compromise with the unions Industrials have backed the PAN and since yesterday energy reform has been on Foxs agenda He said he would not sell assets but that he would open the industry to private investment You have to start somewhere We should work very hard this summer and try to participate in the National Development Plan which is a government plan that the new administration is obligated by law to create and publicize I will offer of my time to help them develop the energy part tof the plan There are rumors that our friend Luis Tellez is staying as well as some of his undersectretaries Hopefully Hector Olea will stay at the CRE as well In the medium term we could see lower interest rates for the Mexican economy Since Sunday they are down more than percentage points to around Hopefully in a couple of yeares we should be well below the mark depending also on the US rates In short all is well south of your border The long transition to democracy is over Best Ricardo Steven J ES PM To Ricardo nron cc Subject Mexico II Wrong and Proud of It What do you think these electiion results are going to mean for us Are you happy for Mexico Forwarded by Steven J KeanHOUEES on PM Michelle Michot Foss HEDU on PM To HEDU cc Subject Mexico II Wrong and Proud of It Dear colleagues if bad predictions lead to contrary but more positive results then I take full blame Clearly we underestimated the power of the opportunity to vote in private in Mexico yesterday with a vote that actually mattered We overestimated the vestigial effects of the PRI machine Early reactions from our advisors and research colleagues in Mexico are strongly favorable there is considerable Fox support among the group and one of our advisory board members may return to active duty in the Fox administration Their reactions are tempered with cautions The vote margin is indeed likely to narrow as final returns especially from rural and southern states with heavy PRI or PRD influence are produced today It is still viewed as unlikely that Fox will have much to work with in the Congress as the PRI majority rule is unlikely to fall to the PAN But well see After the excitement comes the problem of governance Could Fox face the problem that Germany faced after WWII or the FSU after break up The knowledge and experience regarding federal affairs lies with those who served during the Salinas and Zedillo administrations and thus who are associated with PRI governance What appointments are likely to be made as a consequence With no formal civil service what bumps are likely to be felt in this historic transition On the issue of decentralization that I raised last week the betting is that Fox as a former governor will indeed preside over a transfer of some and perhaps considerable power and fiscal authority from federal to state jurisdictions On the housecleaning wish list we can now add an item that Labastida would have been unlikely to pursue a vigorous effort to commercialize but not privatize the national energy companies Unless there are surprises in the final vote tallies today and this could happen the feeling is that Fox will still be bound by campaign rhetoric and limited by lack of a PAN majority in Congress But even if the attention these next six years were on getting things in order improved financial and accounting practices establishing better capital budgeting processes with the PRIPemex bond now broken this longtime goal for Pemex could be realized increasing transparency for operations upgrading management skills and resolving environmental problems and disputes with landowners and state governments that would be a major improvement But this will entail a major effort and

<6345769.1075846393592.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ricardo.charvel@enron.com,1999-12-02 07:29:00,Re World Bank energy reportHere are some thoughts on why I think this is important sorry for the length Political One of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its benefits for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy policy Subsidies should be focused to the consumer In general electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized If there is a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government finances that is if you do not raise the rates for the residential users especially for the poor In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they plan to do with the subsidies but if they make a mistake it will become a social problem I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the advice of economic experts Economic Another way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local economy Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower inflation rate A growing industry creates more employment Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back of the governments finance The government could then re direct resources that it would have invested in the energy sector or use resources from the sale of assets to develop water infrastructure pay foreign debt give micro credits build roads improve health and education Social development poverty There are another aspects that are directly related to the availability of energy services for the poor heating and cooking and water Although most of the developing world has tropical or semi tropical weather and is less subjected to cold weather hot weather generally will not kill you they have some heating needs apart from the energy for cooking needs It is frequent that dung is used as fuel for heating and cooking purposes with terrible effects on health which in turn results in lower productivity etc The available alternative to dung is wood and here the problem is even worse because these poor communities end up causing irreversible damage to the forests and then to the soil and finally to their water resources since the forest sustains the soil and prevents water from causing erosion When the forest dissapears water is not filtered down to natural storages underground As you can see its a mess One other extremely important aspect of the availability of energy for the poor is that it enables them to have potable water delivered as close as possible to their communities In the poorest communities little girls do not go to school because they have to carry the water buckets home They do not get an education The terrible thing about it is that the education level of the mother is what can have a highest impact in the quality of life of a poor family This is very sad and energy plays a huge part in the solution A lot could be researched and written on this matters and about the role of energy in the solution of these problems Can we help Do we have the resources that need to be commited to at least one of these aspects Which one do you think will have the highest impact Best Ricardo
