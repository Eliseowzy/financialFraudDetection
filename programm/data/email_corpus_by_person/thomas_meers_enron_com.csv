<8103481.1075859041216.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,thomas.meers@enron.com,2001-08-07 07:53:57,RE Benefits Costs Cc Cynthia My apologies for the perceived tone of my message I was just trying to explain what I was expecting and how I got there I will follow up with Tracy and Accounting for this information Again my apologies Tom Original Message From Barrow Cynthia Sent Tuesday August AM To Meers Thomas Cc Geaccone Tracy Subject RE Benefits Costs You know I am just too busy to deal with the tone of your messages right now Give me a contact at AA and as soon as I finish my budget and pricing projects I will call them directly Before I can do anything I need the Enron company number for EGP fuels I do know that our actuary has never broken out the expense or PBO for this company Until I know what the company number is we wont know which ETS group it was consolidated within Probably the Services Group but maybe Corp Once we know that then either the ETS accounting or corp accounting can look into the actual intercompany allocations if any Tracy can you do me a favor and look into how you all do the accounting for this company and Ill try to give you a call later this week Tracy I may be able to locate the and possibly the allocation sheets but I am not comfortable that we will still have the budget information for and In addition the trueups definately do not go to this level Arthur Anderson is in the process of completing the preparation of audited financials for EGP Fuels Company Included with these financials are footnote disclosures Please provide the following information to be included with these financials Total charges from Enron Corp for EGP Fuels employee benefit plans for and I would think that the books of EGP should show the actual charges Our reserve records only provide a total distribution allocation This will have to come from accounting EGP Fuels Enron Retirement Plan pension costs for and As stated this is not prepared at the EGP level The best we can do here is to work with the actuary to do an estimate of the costs but this will likely require a historical pull of information which you may or may not have available Ill need to speak with AACO directly to determine best course of action EGP Fuels Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation APBO for benefit plans other than pensions net periodic postretirement benefit costs for and Same as above Original Message From Meers Thomas Sent Tuesday August AM To Barrow Cynthia Huseman Sandy Subject RE Benefits Costs Cynthia Please note that Sandy and I did talk but I was left with the expectation that I would still receive some type of response even if that response was merely that the information is not available Also it was suggested that I try contacting You Mikie and Sandy for this information but I did not receive a response from any of you without additional proding And those responses left me believing that I would hear more from you which I did not Lastly I did mention that if necessary we could look at using Financial Accounting for this information but this is not desirable since this method will result in fragmented and less accurate information Also Arthur Andersen has indicated that this is not the preferred method of providing this information Based on the email which follows below I will assume that Financial Accounting is my only recourse and that You will assist in convincing Arthur Andersen that this is the only alternative available to meet their timing requirements Tom X Original Message From Barrow Cynthia Sent Monday August AM To Huseman Sandy Meers Thomas Subject FW Benefits Costs Sandy told me she talked with you last week in the elevator lobby Just so you know I am not ignoring you I have literally worked weeks straight without a day off and with an average of hour days I can not do this until my budgets and medical pricing are complete If you need it immediately then you will need to do what Sandy talked with you about last week and that is to get with Financial Accounting There is no way I can look at this until later this week Original Message From Meers Thomas Sent Monday August AM To Olson Cindy Cc Barrow Cynthia Subject FW Benefits Costs Cindy Arthur Andersen has requested benefits information necessary to complete audited financials that are required to complete Project Timber the sale of the MTBE assets to EOTT The following requests have not been acknowledged and remain unanswered Please let me know who I should contact for this information Arthur Andersen has since also requested this information for the months ending June and June Any guidance you can provide is greatly appreciated Thanks Tom X Original Message From Meers Thomas Sent Friday August PM To Meers Thomas Barrow Cynthia Rath Mikie
