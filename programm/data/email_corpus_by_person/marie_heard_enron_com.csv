conflict with the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the PB except for silence on the matter You didnt address this point It is Enron Corp policy to include such language and I

account with Goldman Sachs International Daniel Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement the Agreement with my colleague Angela Davis I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter relating to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed but were not in a position to resolve at the time These are Par Arbitration which should conform to Clause J Par of the Agreement I recall that we were discussing the possible use of arbitration in the Agreement and existence of arbitration in the OSLA so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of the Terms of Business Letter Since we ultimately agreed to English courts I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will prevail if in conflict with the Agreement Par Arbitration which should be limited in the same manner as Clause J Par as to limitation of liability I believe that you and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement Why shouldnt these be mirrored in the
