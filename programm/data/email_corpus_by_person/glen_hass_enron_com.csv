see any negative impact on TW perhaps positive P Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at of SoCal firm rate This is the same cap that applies to SoCal I dont like the precedent set in this

backbone facilities TW has primary firm RP of no less than mmfcd Mojave is recognized at only mmfcd firm RP No receipt point complex is given a preference for capacity expansion Line appears to remain useful for TW deliveries into the market load centers The PD modifications to the CSA do not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to support the PD The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore customers with additional cost allocations Points for comments TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights This change in SoCal market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to build long term supply and transportation contracts Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants with gas scheduling certainty The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCals intrastate system will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices The PD correctly observes that the PGE market structure which relieves upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work relatively well during Californias challenging energy markets TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD The energy markets in California have been improving and stabilizing The Commission promising options are still valid in todays gas market Further SoCal is already starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the operating environment on the SoCal system It is consistent to follow through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these improvements TW

Settlement Agreement CSA SoCalGas System Adequacy proceeding testimony of Lad Lorenz and the CPUC Dec Decision on Unbundling the SoCalGas system by implementing the CSA with modifications I also have a call into Rodger Schwecke at SoCal to discuss their upcoming tariff filing and the related capacity issues Some of the pertinent points made in these documents relative to receipt point capacity and allocation are as follows Comprehensive Settlement Agreement Appendix B outlines the details of backbone transmissionreceipt point capacity rights All receipt points will be defined with firm capacity and primary access rights that reflect physical limitations The Appendix B table of receipt point capacity indicates that for No Needles Transwestern has Primary Access Rights of MMcfd and Mojave at Hector Road has Secondary Access Rights For interconnects into SoCalGas with more than one upstream pipeline secondary access rights will be defined New or expanded interconnects with existing or new pipelines will have secondary access rights only and will be subject to bumping by gas scheduled through primary access points In the text of the CSA the Open Season procedures for intrastate backbone transmissionreceipt point capacity are described in detail Briefly its proposed to work as follows Initial Reservation for Core customers SoCalGas Acquisitions core transport agents and wholesale customers serving the core will be provided a set aside amount of capacity This included MMcfd at North Needles First StagePhase I of the Open Season for of RP capacity after deducting core customer set aside Existing noncore customers may bid on any RP capacity up to of their historical usage Second StagePhase II of the Open Season for remainder of Phase I capacity if any not awarded or allocated Available to same existing noncore customers as in Phase I to bid on in this second round if they havent been awarded capacity up to their historical usage Third StagePhase III of the Open Season for of RP capacity after deducting core customer set aside plus any remaining capacity not awarded in Phases I and II Bidding open to any existing or new customers with creditworthiness established SoCalGas will hold annual open seasons for expired or noncontracted available capacity Market concentration limits were set such that no person or entity including affiliates may hold more than of the capacity after core set aside at any one receipt point awarded through the open season process This does not include secondary market capacity or individually negotiated contracts acquired after the initial open season Examples of North Needles capacity Physical capacity MMcfd Addl Core Cust set aside Inc core Avail Cap for bidding Phase I avail cap Phase II avail cap remainder of remainder of or Phase III avail cap remainder of Phases I II if any remainder of Ph I II if any System Adequacy ProceedingLorenz Testimony Lad Lorenz testifies that the proposal to allocate firm receipt point capacity on the SoCalGas system is intended to be used until the commission acts in the GIR proceeding In Section H of Lads testimony on Firm Receipt Point Access Table II illustrates that North Needles will be expanded by MMcfd to a level of In Table III under the heading of Firm Primary Access it states TWwho then allocates among its shippers in reference to the MMcfd of capacity listed for North Needles In this same Section H Lad states that this alternative proposal for allocating primary firm capacity at each receipt point will achieve improved reliability until the Commission acts to approve the CSA CPUC Decision on SoCalGas Unbundling The Commission approved the CSA on Dec with certain modifications These modifications included Market concentration limits were decreased from to and included capacity attained in subsequent open seasons or by individually negotiated contracts Secondary market capacity remains excluded from the market concentration limit A secondary market price cap was established at of the interruptible rate Reinstated the core reservation for intrastate capacity at MMcfd CSA lowered it to This explains why the core reservation for Needles is and doesnt match the TWSoCal contract level The additional was allocated per a Calpine proposal on a prorata basis to each receipt point with Needles receiving an additional MMcfd In the summary and conclusion sections of the Decision SoCalGas was directed to include the additional MMcfd of new backbone and receipt point capacity in its open season This part of the Order did not provide any direction as to how the new capacity was to be allocated to upstream pipelines Additionally SoCalGas was directed to file an advice letter for implementation and to include proposed methods for allocating any additional future capacity additions

SoCal GIR Glen I have reviewed the Revised PD of Comr Bilas as requested In view of the entirety of TWs interest I still ascertain that TW can support the current PD Noted below for your information and review is a summary of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering Market concentration limits reduced from to of available receipt point capacity TW has preferred no limits to market concentration historically However as before I do not believe pushing this issue will be successful or productive for TW There are no market concentration limits in the secondary market Although Bilas warns market participants that any misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation P SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized firm RP capacity I dont see any negative impact on TW perhaps positive P Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at of SoCal firm rate This is the same cap that applies to SoCal I dont like the precedent set in this area however it assures that the economic value allocation between SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the interstate system providers in any tight transportsupply scenario P Not really a change but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd as a deliveryreceipt at Ferc PD does not reduce the cores interstate capacity nor their storage capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels Current level MMcfd proposed MMcfd on the interstate system and current storage BCF MMcfd of injection and MMcfd withdrawal Vs proposed BCF I see no clear negative

Ltr how the cost of noncore default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using this service and not to the Core customers I see no impact on TW P PD rejects the requirement that

end effective the adoption of the PD Additionally noncore customers to pay of core ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements No negative impact on TW Noncore customers bear additional

changes to the small coreESP market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation NO impact on TW interest P Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to

to the approval of the PD No direct impact upon TW interest P On whole the centerpiece of TWs interest in this proceeding remains intact The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with SoCal backbone facilities TW has primary firm RP of no less than mmfcd Mojave is recognized at only mmfcd firm RP No receipt point complex is given a preference for capacity expansion Line appears to remain useful for TW deliveries into the market load centers The PD modifications to the CSA do not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to support the PD The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore customers with additional cost allocations Points for comments TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights This change in SoCal market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to build long term supply and transportation contracts Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants with gas scheduling certainty The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCals intrastate system will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices The PD correctly observes that the PGE market structure which relieves upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work relatively well during Californias challenging energy markets TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD The energy markets in California have been improving and stabilizing The Commission promising options are still valid in todays gas market Further SoCal is already starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the operating environment on the SoCal system It is consistent to follow through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these improvements TW

Fw PGEs Gas Accord II application Importance High Gentlemen Attached is PGEs Gas Accord II application filed as directed by the Commission last month in D It is captioned as the Application of Pacific Gas and Electric Company U G Proposing a Market Structure and Rules for the Northern California Natural Gas Industry for the Period Beginning January The Commission Order required an application proposing a market structure rates and terms and conditions of service relating to the PGE gas transmission and storage system for the period beginning January when most of the provisions of the existing Gas Accord are scheduled to expire There is no testimony attached Instead PGE notes that the service of supporting testimony at the time an application is filed is not required by the Commissions Rules of Practice and Procedure They say that testimony if any would be filed after a prehearing conference is scheduled The utility suggests December for the conference In summary PGE requests Commission authorization to extend the existing approved Gas Accord market structure and rates for a twoyear period Under this proposal those provisions of the Gas Accord currently scheduled to expire as of January will be extended through December while other provisions of Gas Accord scheduled to expire as of April consisting of certain storagerelated provisions will be extended through March As noted by the utility This approach would not preclude parties from proposing specific justified operational or other limited changes during the twoyear extension period However as discussed below parties seeking to obtain Commission approval of changes in the Gas Accord regime and thus to alter the status quo must bear the brden of proof on such issues If the simple twoyear extension of the Gas Accord is adopted as requested PGE says it will waive the percent escalation for the twoyear Gas Accord II extension period The application also notes that on September shortly after issuance of D PGE filed a Plan of Reorganization with the Bankruptcy Court which if adopted would substantially restructure PGEs existing business operations As proposed the Plan of Reorganization would alter the regulation of PGEs natural gas transmission and storage system as the utilitys gas transmission and storage operations would be transferred from PGE to a new corporation and operated under exclusive FERC jurisdiction Assuming FERC accepted such jurisdiction the CPUC would no longer would have jurisdiction over the rates or terms and conditions of service on the PGE gas transmission and storage system Your thoughts on this development would also be appreciated I assume we need to review this application to determine its potential impact on Transwestern and that we should of course monitor the proceeding generally to determine if any active role is required at a later date What are the fundamental issues that concern Transwestern when considering PGE How do you feel about FERC jurisdiction of its transmissionstorage systems Finally note that PGE states that contributing to uncertainty in the gas markets is the large number of interstate pipeline construction projects that have been proposed It will take at least a year or two before the viability and impacts of those various pipeline projects can be confirmed in the marketplace The utility also includes a footnote that references the Transwestern Red Rock FERC application as well as seven other projects as pending at FERC Lets discuss at your convenience Dan Law Offices of Daniel W Douglass Topanga Canyon Blvd Suite

COMMISSION APPROVES BOWIE POWER PROJECT Requires Use of Solor Technology Groundwater Monitoring Program PHOENIX In a decision yesterday the Arizona Corporation Commission appro ved the Bowie Power Station proposed for eastern Cochise County in southeas tern Arizona The project to be constructed in two megawatt phases is a watercooled power plant using a maximum of acrefeet of groundwat er per year when both units are operating continuously at full output Sout hWestern Power Group II is the project developer The approval requires Sou thWestern to install solar technology when they begin building the second p ower block This is the first merchant power plant that is required to inco rporate solar technology as a core part of the total project Merchant powe r plants supply power to the wholesale market as opposed to power plants bu ilt by a utility with the primary objective of serving its own customers D uring Tuesdays meeting the Commission accepted the restrictions placed on the project by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmission Line Siting Com mittee After hearing from several representatives of the Bowie and Willcox communities the Commissioners approved an amendment offered by Commission er Spitzer The Spitzer amendment specifically addresses concerns by nearby pistachio farmers that groundwater pumping could affect the surrounding wa ter table Summary of the Spitzer Amendment The amendment requires SouthWe stern Power Group II to establish and pay for a groundwater monitoring prog ram that meets Arizona Department of Water Resources criteria Once the pro ject is operating the SouthWestern will have to establish and make annual contributions of to a Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund until the fund reaches a balance of Any business or individual who can pro ve through successful arbitration that groundwater pumping has caused pro perty or economic damage will be able to submit a claim for reimbursement SouthWestern will be required to maintain a total balance of in th e fund Status reports on the program are to be filed with the Town of Bowi e the Pistachio Pass Irrigation District and the Cochise County Board of S upervisors The Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund must be maintained for t hree years after the plant ceases operation and is decommissioned Commissi oner Marc Spitzer said the amendment was prudent considering that the lasti ng impact of the power project I proposed this amendment to answer the co ncerns of the pistachio farmers and the irrigation district Commissioner Marc Spitzer said Although we heard testimony that the power plants grou ndwater needs would be less than if the land were farmed I dont think you can be too careful Were making decisions that could affect an economical ly depressed area for generations to come Other Environmental Conditions Twentytwo conditions were imposed by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmis sion Line Siting Committee They include Establishment of a monitoring p roject and mitigation fund for ground subsidence and earth fissure monitori ng Subsidence is a potential side effect of groundwater pumping Cracks f issures or dips can form in the surface of the earth because the water deep underground that provided physical support is no longer there Contribut ions to the Bowie Fire District to enable it to acquire an additional emerg ency services vehicle as well as funding of emergency response and hazardou s materials training for firefighters Making arrangements with local law enforcement and the Cochise County Sheriff because the project will involv e an increase in traffic and may result in the need for emergency responses by local law enforcement This was an amendment sponsored by Commissioner Jim Irvin Prior to construction of the facility SouthWestern must provi de the Commission with a technical study showing that sufficient transmissi on capacity exists to accommodate the output of the plant and the effect of its output on reliable operation of the electric grid Conditions requir ing compliance with air and water quality standards imposed by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and the Arizona Department of Water Res ources Additionally the applicant will have to participate in and comply with all standards for safe reliable power delivery I was pleased to sup port this project in part because it includes solar technology as a key co mponent of the whole project The level of support from the local community was also impressive Les Thompson Chairman of the Cochise County Board of Supervisors indicated that Bowie has one of the highest tax rates of any A rizona community Chairman Bill Mundell explained The residents and busi ness people were very excited about the tax and economic development benefi ts of having the power plant in their community Additionally the project will bring several hundred construction jobs to Bowie and Willcox and ulti mately the or people needed to run the plant Commissioner Irvin vo ted in favor of the project saying I do believe the need for this projec t was established in the record Further I believe the project is in the p ublic interest and meets the balancing test He was referring to the sitin g statute that requires the Commission to balance in the broad public int erest the need for an adequate economical and reliable supply of electric power with the desire to minimize the effect thereof on the environment an d ecology of this state Arizona Revised Statutes subsection B For more information about recent power plant sitings

Comprehensive Settlement Agreement CSA SoCalGas System Adequacy proceeding testimony of Lad Lorenz and the CPUC Dec Decision on Unbundling the SoCalGas system by implementing the CSA with modifications I also have a call into Rodger Schwecke at SoCal to discuss their upcoming tariff filing and the related capacity issues Some of the pertinent points made in these documents relative to receipt point capacity and allocation are as follows Comprehensive Settlement Agreement Appendix B outlines the details of backbone transmissionreceipt point capacity rights All receipt points will be defined with firm capacity and primary access rights that reflect physical limitations The Appendix B table of receipt point capacity indicates that for No Needles Transwestern has Primary Access Rights of MMcfd and Mojave at Hector Road has Secondary Access Rights For interconnects into SoCalGas with more than one upstream pipeline secondary access rights will be defined New or expanded interconnects with existing or new pipelines will have secondary access rights only and will be subject to bumping by gas scheduled through primary access points In the text of the CSA the Open Season procedures for intrastate backbone transmissionreceipt point capacity are described in detail Briefly its proposed to work as follows Initial Reservation for Core customers SoCalGas Acquisitions core transport agents and wholesale customers serving the core will be provided a set aside amount of capacity This included MMcfd at North Needles First StagePhase I of the Open Season for of RP capacity after deducting core customer set aside Existing noncore customers may bid on any RP capacity up to of their historical usage Second StagePhase II of the Open Season for remainder of Phase I capacity if any not awarded or allocated Available to same existing noncore customers as in Phase I to bid on in this second round if they havent been awarded capacity up to their historical usage Third StagePhase III of the Open Season for of RP capacity after deducting core customer set aside plus any remaining capacity not awarded in Phases I and II Bidding open to any existing or new customers with creditworthiness established SoCalGas will hold annual open seasons for expired or noncontracted available capacity Market concentration limits were set such that no person or entity including affiliates may hold more than of the capacity after core set aside at any one receipt point awarded through the open season process This does not include secondary market capacity or individually negotiated contracts acquired after the initial open season Examples of North Needles capacity Physical capacity MMcfd Addl Core Cust set aside Inc core Avail Cap for bidding Phase I avail cap Phase II avail cap remainder of remainder of or Phase III avail cap remainder of Phases I II if any remainder of Ph I II if any System Adequacy ProceedingLorenz Testimony Lad Lorenz testifies that the proposal to allocate firm receipt point capacity on the SoCalGas system is intended to be used until the commission acts in the GIR proceeding In Section H of Lads testimony on Firm Receipt Point Access Table II illustrates that North Needles will be expanded by MMcfd to a level of In Table III under the heading of Firm Primary Access it states TWwho then allocates among its shippers in reference to the MMcfd of capacity listed for North Needles In this same Section H Lad states that this alternative proposal for allocating primary firm capacity at each receipt point will achieve improved reliability until the Commission acts to approve the CSA CPUC Decision on SoCalGas Unbundling The Commission approved the CSA on Dec with certain modifications These modifications included Market concentration limits were decreased from to and included capacity attained in subsequent open seasons or by individually negotiated contracts Secondary market capacity remains excluded from the market concentration limit A secondary market price cap was established at of the interruptible rate Reinstated the core reservation for intrastate capacity at MMcfd CSA lowered it to This explains why the core reservation for Needles is and doesnt match the TWSoCal contract level The additional was allocated per a Calpine proposal on a prorata basis to each receipt point with Needles receiving an additional MMcfd In the summary and conclusion sections of the Decision SoCalGas was directed to include the additional MMcfd of new backbone and receipt point capacity in its open season This part of the Order did not provide any direction as to how the new capacity was to be allocated to upstream pipelines Additionally SoCalGas was directed to file an advice letter for implementation and to include proposed methods for allocating any additional future capacity additions

modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and Retention of primary firm RP capacity of MMd at Needles from Transwestern gh Original Message From ENRON Sent Tuesday October PM To Hass Glen Subject Bilas Proposed Decision SoCal GIR Glen I have reviewed the Revised PD of Comr Bilas as requested In view of the entirety of TWs interest I still ascertain that TW can support the current PD Noted below for your information and review is a summary of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering Market concentration limits reduced from to of available receipt point capacity TW has preferred no limits to market concentration historically However as before I do not believe pushing this issue will be successful or productive for TW There are no market concentration limits in the secondary market Although Bilas warns market participants that any misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation P SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized firm RP capacity I dont see any negative impact on TW perhaps positive P Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at of SoCal firm rate This is the same cap that applies to SoCal I dont like the precedent set in this area however it assures that the economic value allocation between SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the interstate system providers in any tight transportsupply scenario P Not really a change but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd as a deliveryreceipt at Ferc PD does not reduce the cores interstate capacity nor their storage capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels Current level MMcfd proposed MMcfd on the interstate system and current storage BCF MMcfd of injection and MMcfd withdrawal Vs proposed BCF I see no clear negative impact on TW from this changeP CTAs Core Transport Agents allowed to reject only their prorata share of nonreliability storage service No impact on TW interests P SoCal directed to presentvia Advice Ltr how the cost of noncore default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using this service and not to the Core customers I see no impact on TW P PD rejects the requirement that SoCalSDGE file an application with a proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider I see only positive attributes of this change for TW P Preserves the right for SoCalSDGE to seek recovery of expenditures associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator NO impact on TW P PD orders a cap on ITCS stranded costresponsibility borne by bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity No direct impact upon TW interest however likely a touchy point with noncore interest P PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective the adoption of the PD Additionally noncore customers to pay of core ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements No negative impact on TW Noncore customers bear additional expense The PD estimates an additional million over next to years P The PD provides an estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between and to be approx Million PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of to cents No impact on TW interest P PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis No impact on TW P Generally the PD makes some administrative changes to the small coreESP market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation NO impact on TW interest P Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to services envisioned under the CSA Owing to the fact that SoCal has already started to implement portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a balancing account etc Bottomline not consequential to the approval of the PD No direct impact upon TW interest P On whole the centerpiece of TWs interest in this proceeding remains intact The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with SoCal backbone facilities TW has primary firm RP of no less than mmfcd Mojave is recognized at only mmfcd firm RP No receipt point complex is given a preference for capacity expansion Line appears to remain useful for TW deliveries into the market load centers The PD modifications to the CSA do not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to support the PD The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore customers with additional cost allocations Points for comments TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights This change in SoCal market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to build long term supply and transportation contracts Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants with gas scheduling certainty The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCals intrastate system will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices The PD correctly observes that the PGE market structure which relieves upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work relatively well during Californias challenging energy markets TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD The energy markets in California have been improving and stabilizing The Commission promising options are still valid in todays gas market Further SoCal is already starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the operating environment on the SoCal system It is consistent to follow through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these improvements TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD ON THIS POINT TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call Mark IGS Mark IGS

transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator NO impact on TW P PD orders a cap on ITCS stranded costresponsibility borne by bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity No direct impact upon TW interest however likely a touchy point with noncore interest P PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective the adoption of the PD Additionally noncore customers to pay of core ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements No negative impact on TW Noncore customers bear additional expense The PD estimates an additional million over next to years P The PD provides an estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between and to be approx Million PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of to cents No impact on TW interest P PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis No impact on TW P Generally the PD makes some administrative changes to the small coreESP market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation NO impact on TW interest P Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to services envisioned under the CSA Owing to the fact that SoCal has already started to implement portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a balancing account etc Bottomline not consequential to the approval of the PD No direct impact upon TW interest P On whole the centerpiece of TWs interest in this proceeding remains intact The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with SoCal backbone facilities TW has primary firm RP of no less than mmfcd Mojave is recognized at only mmfcd firm RP No receipt point complex is given a preference for capacity expansion Line appears to remain useful for TW deliveries into the market load centers The PD modifications to the CSA do not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to support the PD The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore customers with additional cost allocations Points for comments TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights This change in SoCal market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to build long term supply and transportation contracts Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants with gas scheduling certainty The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCals intrastate system will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices The PD correctly observes that the PGE market structure which relieves upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work relatively well during Californias challenging energy markets TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD The energy markets in California have been improving and stabilizing The Commission promising options are still valid in todays gas market Further SoCal is already starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the operating environment on the SoCal system It is consistent to follow through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these improvements TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD ON THIS POINT TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call

mailtoIMCEANOTESDanDouglassCdouglassenergyattorney EcomE NRONcom Sent Tuesday October PM To Pryor Tony Subject SoCalGas Developments Tony SoCalGas sent out last week a copy of its new Biennial Cost Allocation Proceeding BCAP application The nominal purpose of the filing is to revise rates for gas service effective and to revise rates to reflect an updated allocation among customers of noncommodity costs of service The utility also requests authority to revise and simplify various tariffs and to implement several new programs which will enhance the efficient use and operation of its gas transportation system I am calling this to your attention because I recommend that Transwestern monitor this proceeding review the application and determine how active if at all it may wish to be in this proceeding The utility will be forecasting both gas demand and gas prices during presenting two cost allocation studies and two rate proposals They will also be proposing that the Commission switch from long run marginal cost to embedded cost principles for allocating costs of service among its customers The also propose a million or rate increase annually compared to present rates The utility discusses in detail the issues of interstate pipeline capacity and storage reservation for the core and the projected annual cost of the core interstate pipeline capacity reservation Their capacity issues witness advocates continued core responsibility for its portion of the ITCS He also makes proposals designed to enhance customer access to SoCalGas transmission and storage assets some of which were surfaced initially in the context of the Natural Gas Strategy proceeding He proposes firm intrastate receipt points an open season to solicit interest in an expansion of the backbone system a new inkind fuel charge for transmission and an expansion of the unbundled storage program to include gas loaning services finally they also propose incremental expansions of both transmissionand storage capacity Tony it seems to me that Transwestern should monitor this proceeding review the application thoroughly including a supplement that SoCalGas says it will be filing soon and make a decision as to whether the proposed changes will affect the SoCalGasTranswestern relationship andor the relationships between Transwestern and its shippers You can then decide whether monitoring is sufficient or if you need to participate One last thing Yesterday the Southern California Generation Coalition SCGC submitted a motion to supplement the Phase II record in the OII proceeding SCGC noted that the OII has discussed SoCalGas requested approval of Advice Letters Nos and SCGC argued in both its opening and reply brief that Schedule GTF clearly requires SoCalGas to provide firm full requirements service to customers electing that service option Alternatively SCGC argued that to the extent Schedule GTF is ambiguous it must be construed in favor of customers in the Imperial and San Joaquin Valleys However the SoCalGas BCAP Application described above submits proposed revisions to Schedule GTF SCGC complains that SoCalGas did not disclose in its reply brief the fact that it was seeking in its BCAP Application to revise the language of Schedule GTF The motion states that The additional language SoCalGas has added to Schedule GTF clearly constitutes an admission through conduct by SoCalGas that Schedule GTF is not clear on its face It constitutes an admission that Schedule GTF as now constituted needs to be clarified It admits that Schedule GTF is ambiguous and in making that admission resolves the ambiguity SCGC then requests the record be reopened to reflect these facts Let me know what you would like to do with regard to the SoCalGas applicationand please pass this on to Steve Harris for his information Thanks Dan Law Offices of Daniel W Douglass Topanga Canyon Blvd Suite Woodland Hills CA Tel Fax File mailto LADOC File LADOC This

of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants with gas scheduling certainty The creation of tradable secondary rights

unutilized firm RP capacity I dont see any negative impact on TW perhaps positive P Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at of SoCal firm rate This is the same cap that applies to SoCal I dont like the precedent set in this area however it assures that the economic value allocation between SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the interstate system providers in any tight transportsupply scenario P Not really a change but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd as a deliveryreceipt at Ferc PD does not reduce the cores interstate capacity nor their storage capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels Current level MMcfd proposed MMcfd on the interstate system and current storage BCF MMcfd of injection and MMcfd withdrawal Vs

Noncore customers bear additional expense The PD estimates an additional million over next to years P The PD provides an estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between and to be approx Million PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of to cents No impact on TW interest P PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis No impact on TW P Generally the PD makes some administrative changes to the small coreESP market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation NO impact on TW interest P Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to services envisioned under the CSA Owing to the fact that SoCal has already started to implement portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a balancing account etc Bottomline not consequential to the approval of the PD No direct impact upon TW interest P On whole the centerpiece of TWs interest in this proceeding remains intact The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with SoCal backbone facilities TW has primary firm RP of no less than mmfcd Mojave is recognized at only mmfcd firm RP No receipt point complex is given a preference for capacity expansion Line appears to remain useful for TW deliveries into the market load centers The PD modifications to the CSA do not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to support

TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights This change in SoCal market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to build long term supply and transportation contracts Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants with gas scheduling certainty The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCals intrastate system will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices The PD correctly observes that the PGE market structure which relieves upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work relatively well during Californias challenging energy markets TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD The energy markets in California have been improving and stabilizing The Commission promising options are still valid in todays gas market Further SoCal is already starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the operating environment on the SoCal system It is consistent to follow through and make the structural changes required to
