Blachman Jeremy Schwarz Angela Dasovich Jeff Steffes James D Cc Merril Deborah D Subject RE Green Power Partners The Agreements between Enron Energy Services Inc and Green Power Partners I LLC are for a term endinging December The Agreement between Fetzer Vineyards and Enron Energy Services Inc is for a term ending April The Agreement between Lost Arrow Inc Patagonia and Enron Energy Services Inc is for a term ending December Additionally Enron Energy Services Inc has entered into various agreements with Enron Power Marketing Inc to sell additional green tickets from the Greeen Power Partners I LLC facilities in California EESI sells to EPMI MW ATC through December EPMI sells to EEMC EPMI sells to EEMC MW ATC through June EESI sells to EPMI MWs Sundays Off Peak through December EPMI sells to LADWP EESI sells to EPMI MWs Sundays ATC through December EPMI sells to LADWP I do not know for sure how whether or not EPMI still plans to deliver to EEMC andor LADWP however if they plan to continue these sales and depending on our decision relative to Fetzer Vineyards andor Lost Arrow Inc Patagonia we may want to keep the Green Power Partners I LLC Agreement alive I have discussed the EPMI deals with LADWP with Chris Foster EPMI Portland Office and am currently awaiting an answer from Chris as to the current status with LADWP Let me know if you have any questions Richard Ring Original Message From Smith Mike D Sent Thursday January PM To Frazier Lamar Blachman Jeremy Schwarz Angela Dasovich Jeff Steffes James D Cc Merril Deborah D Ring Richard Subject RE Green Power Partners In this case there is a product element because at least the retail contracts I named require us to serve green If we assume them we have to have green to serve Original Message From Frazier Lamar Sent Thursday January PM To Smith Mike D Blachman Jeremy Schwarz Angela Dasovich Jeff Steffes James D Cc Merril Deborah D Ring Richard Subject RE Green Power Partners I thought the call on whether a contract is rejected was an economic call and not a product call If this is not the case then could we be forced to swallow the other discount off tariff contracts we intend to reject Further we need to know what the revenue is against this purchase to make a call on the economics Richard Do you have the Patagonia Contract Andor any of the other green power transactions that EES has entered into with customers Original Message From Smith Mike D Sent Thursday January PM To Blachman Jeremy Frazier Lamar Schwarz Angela Dasovich Jeff Steffes James D Cc Merril Deborah D Ring Richard Subject RE Green Power Partners Sounds like the economic justification for rejection is clear However we need to be sure that we are not going to keep any customers where we have a contractual requirement to serve green power Fetzer Patagonia If we are comfortable that we are not I think we can reject MDS Original Message From Blachman Jeremy Sent Thursday January PM To Smith Mike D Frazier Lamar Schwarz Angela Dasovich Jeff Steffes James D Cc Merril Deborah D Subject FW Green Power Partners take a look at this Unless there is a customer or regulatory reason to keep this PPA it would seem to me that we would want to reject this contract Thoughtscomments so we can proceed Jeremy Original Message From ONeil Murray P Sent Thursday January AM To Blachman Jeremy Subject FW Green Power Partners FYI Hope this helps in your decision making MO Original Message From Perry Todd Sent Wednesday January PM To ONeil Murray P Subject RE Green Power Partners Murry Our forward curves show SP power at MWh for the period note that this does not include the discount for unitcontingency that usually accompanies wind power Green tags trade in the market for about MWh Under the Green Tickets Sales Agreement it appears that EES has agreed to pay MWh minus the market price of power which is approximately MWh for Green Tickets using our forward curves Let me know if you need any additional information Todd Original Message From ONeil Murray P Sent Wednesday January PM To Blachman Jeremy Smith Mike D Perry Todd Richter Jeff Subject FW Green Power Partners Attached you will find two agreements EES has with ENRON Wind Green Ticket Purchase Sale Agreement PPA Scheduling Coordinator Service Agreement With EES ENA bankruptcy and the fact that Enron Wind has not been paid for the generation back to the month of November through current Enron Wind is attempting to move their needs to APX for SC Services I also think they were looking for someone else to purchase their energy I put a temporary stop on their actions but we are going to need to review these contracts to determine if we want to continue operating under them Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible
