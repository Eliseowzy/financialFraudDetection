Legato and Rational and whether you believe there is scope for reviewing these licenses with a view to changing the relevant license agreements that would be extremely helpful We understand that both these products would be critical components to running the Netco systems Thx Ursula Original Message From RogerRoss Sent January To bwells Cc RogerRoss stephenkahn Mills Ursula Subject RE Service Bureau Prohibitions Thanks Bert As promised I am following up with E Company on the various assigned agreements that prohibit providing service to a third party Feel free to have Ursula pursue the question simultaneously I am also looking into what services the parties intend Fire to provide for transition as this is not a part of the transaction that I have been following closely to date Roger

please immediately advise the sender by reply email that this message has been inadvertently transmitted to you and delete this email from your system Thank you for your cooperation Steve and Roger We are reviewing a sampling of third party software licenses E Company entered and seem to have found two licenses not previously noted by E Company as containing an express prohibition on use as part of a service bureau As I discussed with Roger briefly yesterday this we assume is as much an issue for you as it would be for us because operation of the IT on a service bureau basis initially is a key mutual expectation Both licenses are listed on your draft Schedule fi to the Contribution Agreement so Im guessing they are material to the Business and the relevant software would have to be operated for U Companys benefit U Company hasnt spoken to any E Company IT personnel to learn the significance of the affected software but Ursula Mills is planning to raise the question with Jay Webb or another appropriate person The two licenses are Enterprise Software License Agreement between Legato Systems Inc and E Corp dated as of Sept respecting numerous software products generally branded with the names NetWorker GEMS Celestra Octopus and others Section provides Restrictions on Use Licensee shall not and shall not aid abet or permit any third party to iii use for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use the Software for the benefit of third parties Products License Agreement Modified for E Corp issued by Ration Software Corp dated as of Feb respecting various software products branded Clearcase Rational Purify and Quantify and others Section provides General Grant of License You may not rent lease or use the Product in a service bureau capacity We continue to review the agreements for the Service Bureau issue as it is the most pressing from a time perspective We have already found several ambiguous licenses and will bring those to your attention as a group later If other express provisions such as the above turn up I will let you know on a case by case basis as this issue is one our IT personnel are taking seriously Bert Bert Wells Covington Burling
