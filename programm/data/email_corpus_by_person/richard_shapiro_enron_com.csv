noir of the WTO ESC effort Finally you might talk to Tom Briggs I think Joe has stood Toms position on its head Joe has argued that we need to be in the ESC because other things we care about like financial services regulation and ecommerce will be implicated He says Tom argues that we must liberalise energy to realise these objectives As I understand Tom and he can speak for himself if we do not get energy services liberalised and the exclusion of thirdparty access is tantamount to not getting energy services liberalised then the makeweight arguments about ecommerce and financial services

Schroeder To Steven J nron Richard nron cc Subject RE Energy Services Tom Briggs was good enough to forward to me a piece of correspondence that Joe Hillings apparently shared with him My lack of enthusiasm for our WTO initiative I know has hardly been masked but frankly what is contained in the incoming letter below I find quite disconcerting I have argued that in our key markets eg Europe Japan etc I am assuming we do not need it in the USA even today the WTO initiative ie liberalisation of energy siervices would be of little value by the time it was implemented I had apparently mistakenly at least assumed that liberalisation of energy siervices at a minimum meant thirdparty access to transmission networks If not then what the heck are we doing in this fight BUT as you will see from the incoming below when Paul Hennemeyer of my team here in London joined Joe and Bob Fisher in Geneva to do a presentation on liberalisation of energy services in WTO it provoked a letter to which Joe responded saying that the US Energy Services Coalition has NEVER taken a position on thrid party access and it is doubtful they could agree to such a position Joe agreed and said this was just an Enron company position You can probably guess my position on this but I thought I would forward this to you for your information and if warranted follow up as the conversations we have had have never led me to believe that either of you thought we were pursuing a WTO initiative which did NOT involve third party access thanks mcs Forwarded by Mark SchroederLONECT on From Tom NRON on CST

fax email Brian Thank you for your thoughtful and complete statement of the issue The ESC has not taken any position on the regulatory details of market access nor advocated any such as Third Party Access although Enron certainly has taken a public position at the EU and other venues preferring TPA but willing to be practical about the issue I greatly appreciate your cutting through to the concern It is helpful and hopefully will help us in future presentations I know it will help me Regards Joe Raggett Brian AM To cc Arscott Lyn Subject RE Energy Services Joe Having raised the matter covered by the exchange of emails between yourself and Lyn I feel I should clarify my observations of the meeting at the WTO I am confident that the WTO representatives were better informed and enlightened by the presentations given by the ESC I am sure they were also struck as was I by Pauls enthusiastic explanation of the range of innovative energy services offered by Enron What sparked my concern was the reference to access to energy networks Personally I do not and more importantly nor does OGP take a position on TPA in the EU to which you refer in your communication Even more so in the context of the WTO because it has never been discussed I surmise though that other ESC members would have similar reservations My concerns were heightened by questions on the subject raised by one or two of our interlocutors This part of the discussion then broadened somewhat and included information about a court case in Germany to overcome entrenched opposition to TPA by certain network operators I know not whom I believe it would be a pity if the broader aspects of energy services supported generally by the ESC became subsumed by a debate on TPA to either nationally or privately owned networks to which some WTO governments outside Europe and the United States maybe opposed While I detected concerns about this in the questions asked I dont think that the baby was thrown away with the bathwater It is my view however that the ESC should be cautious about raising an issue which some governments may perceive to be outside what they think is a more reasonable agenda and to which rightly or wrongly they have antipathy My concern is that this may then be used to forestall the worthy and perhaps more achievable objectives of the ESC to include the wide range of services advocated in the main by Paul and by the others who presented I most certainly have a positive view on the value of your work and I hope this helps I am not sure at this point whether I will be available to join you in London but I am planning to attend the conference on November and I look forward to meeting you and Bob once again Kind regards Brian Original Message From Arscott Lyn SMTP

grateful if you could select the restaurant Should another time be more convenient with you please let me know From your response regarding the comment in Geneva I am not feeling that I addressed the specifics of your concern so at the risk of prolonging the pain Ill make another stab at a response If the concern centers on liberalization of transmission access for electricity and natural gas I would respond that we want to see the EU electricity and natural gas directives fully implemented The EU had asked member countries to fully implement transmission access and it is being accomplished in a phased in approach Some member countries are doing it in a way that makes energy services possible some to a less degree and so far France has not adopted the implementing legislation which is a subject of concern to the EU The opening up of markets to the maximum degree possible is a broad goal of the Energy Services Coalition recognizing that this is a position that has to be negotiated We have not recommended any specific regulatory system or regime If I am still missing your concern please bear with me and bring me in closer to any concern that you may have Regards and best wishes Joe

James D ES Richard ES cc Joe nron Sarah nron Charles CT Richard CT Subject Joes group accomplishments in SO FAR Per Jims request for the database I dont know if you want to put the values that Kevin is giving into the database Completed the negotiations and FERC filing of the Next Hour Market scheduling proposal When implemented scheduled for June this will provide one stop shopping for next hour business Ties OASIS and TAGGING together into one request Also if a tranmission provider cuts the transmission the PSE only pays for his actual use versus what he originally scheduled This will speed up the ability to schedule the next hour nonfirm This order is an important recognition by FERC that its OATT did not cover hourly which we complained about alot at FERCs hotline last summer Successful in obtaining the release of all ISN system information to marketers in the WSCC region This was an individual effort by Dick that h as been benificial for our traders in the WEST Successfully prevented the WS CC Operating Committee from taking action that would have reversed this effort Assisted in getting the initial control areas in SERC approved last ye ar and preventing ATC changes this year and OC changes that would have negated the Control Area effort Dick served as Co CHAIR of the ISO committee that put the SPP contract in place that eliminated MW mile pricing in SPP and will serve as the basis for SPPs RTO Dick was appointed to the NERC Control Area Task Force which was formed as a result of our the success of the Enron Control Areas in TVA and have s o far been successful in keeping this effort so that it is non punitive Thi s has turned into a very positive process that may result in a new configuration of the NERC relibiability effort Dicks made comments to ENTERGY that helped push Entergy into filing their new scheduling procedure ultimate source and sink with FERC This was initially going to be implemented unilaterally March without a FERC filing and Enron would have been forced into an after the fact complaint situation at FERC where we are not allowed to get damages that we would hav e incurred in the meantime See Comm Masseys concurrence in Aquila v Enter gy about the lack of incentive to file complaints Kevin Presto said that winning the protest at FERC due would be worth MM On TECO revised its proposed generator imbalance charge from minute by minute to hourly accountability notably TECO revised its propos al before FERC issued an order based on the EPSA protest herein We worked wi th EPSA to file an EPSA protest to TECOs proposal We didnt like TECO s proposal but had commercial concerns about filing a protest in our own name since Enron is working with TECO on a project We were able to get EPSA to protest this issue in TECOs initial filing Enron is planning to site generation in Florida but we dont have the value on this win yet FERC issued a NOPR on January proposing to revise the way it assesses annual charges to public utilities Enron along with several other participants Dynegy Koch APX Citizens NP Energy Sonat a nd Williams filed a petition for rulemaking with FERC in August requesting FERC to revise its methodology for assessing annual charges arguing that FERCs current system of assessing annual charges on sales for resale of power discourages trading impedes reliance on competitive market s for power and could create competitive advantages for utilities over new power marketers entering the market We proposed that FERC either assess i ts costs on transmission only or reallocate the amounts that it collects through sales transactions versus transmission transactions Although FERC does not grant our petition and in fact dismisses it as moot the petition served its purpose In the NOPR FERC notes that because most of its time is spent on transmission issues a point that we made in the Petition it is appropria te to assess costs only on the MWh of electric energy transmitted in interstat e commerce by public utilities Under the current assessment system FERC divides its costs between transmission and sales Now FERC is proposing to collect its costs solely through transmission FERC justifies this change because it spends most of its time on transmission issues and because transmission providers can collect the fees through transmission charges assessed to users of the grid FERC proposes to asses its costs to unbundled wholesale transmission unbundled retail transmission and bundled wholesale power sales Bundled native load transactions will apparently avoid assessments of any FERCrelated costs however EPSA and Enron are protesting this issue at FERC Jim Steffes has been working on a calculation of additional value Interconnection Policy Utilizing EPSA efforts including Sarahs meeting with FERC we got the policy statement we urged FERC to put forth in the forum we suggested ie an existing proceeding in the Tennessee Powe r order where FERC said interconnection procedures should follow the pro form a tariff including that a generator doesnt have to request transmission and interconnection at the same time We worked with EPSA to draft the Model interconnection agreement that EPSA filed at FERC in the Entergy interconnection proposal AEPCSW order approved the merger but accepted intervenors testimony showing market power and conditioned merger on an independent calculation of ATC postings which we proposed and independent market monitor soon after the merger occurs with RTO participation by Kevin Presto said the independent ATC calculation is worth MM to Enron Note we are going to propose MAIN instead of SPP which AEP chose Kev in said that AEPs ATC calculation can trump all interfaces in ECAR so this h as a positive effect not just on AEP but on all of ECAR MAPP FERC further order on refunds MAPP refused to refund moni es that it was unable to collect from a nonjurisdictional member transmission owner NPPD EPMI filed a protest to MAPPs refund report arguing that MAPP was ordered to make full refunds and it violated that order FERC agreed with Enron and rejected MAPPs refund report FERC said MAPP must refun d the full amount to transmission customers whether or not it was able to collec t that money from NPPD Results in another of refunds for EPMI Sarah is working on the PGE sale

that the governmental affairs group filed in January on behalf of Transredes has come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates will go into effect towards the end of this month The rates are not much lower than what we filed for and represent a very significant increase over the previous rates The tariff methodology and revised regulations put into effect by the Supreme Decree were followed to the letter by the regulator despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down The deliverables here were to obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would make the company financeable rescue it from dire financial straits and file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the tariff methodology This second deliverable has now been completed Transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the uncertainty about rates it is my understanding that the financial market loved the ruling and that Transredes sold million worth of bonds in about minutes This ruling should also significantly increase Transredess market value relative to Enrons efforts to sell its interest in the company Forwarded by Ray AlvarezNAEnron on AM Doug Farmer PM To Peter E WeidlerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Jan van den RANSREDES John RANSREDES Cyro RANSREDES Pedro RANSREDES Fernando RANSREDES Subject Tariffs Approved Gentlemen I am delighted to report that SIRESE approved substantial increases in TRs tariffs consistent with the Law and Regulation The details are Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved Increase TRCLHB Proposed TRCLHB Increase Gas Export including surcharges excluding RG Liquids Domestic Liquids Export CLHBs tariffs were also approved as follows As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB comparable with our liquids domestic We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach their conclusions on Monday but our inteligence suggests the following Export gas volumes increased to TR capacity and GSA Cuiaba assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes RG Compresion project deleted Interest rate reduced to or ie the rate in our bond issue Liquids expansion in the South reduced Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between concesions OCC in service date slipped from to DebtEquity assumption changed from to Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows Volumes Covered by rule we can blete but can expect little back here Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the short term ie RG Compression not worth fighting for since we dont even have the support of BG Interest Rate Well get this back when we do a tariff revision and actual rates are used When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we have concrete grounds ie commision costs etc are omited Liquids Expansion in the South Here we intend to do a detailed analysis of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquidsgas production will be shut in If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected producers PB BG Vintage and Chaco We will then write to those producerscopy SIRESE VMEH etc stating that on their recommendation the project scope was reduced by SIRESE We will give them an estimate of the lost liquidsgas production in both volume and cash terms resultant from this decision We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal Continuity of Service Capex We need to see the detail here We will take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared to compromise our safety and environmental standards We need to see exactly what has been removed but my thought is that if that means we are unable to provide some services eg LPG transportation or the continued operation of some liquids laterals we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the decision Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the SIRESE budget process OPEX need to see the detail on Monday OCC will not appeal we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC strategy DebtEquity ratio Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance with the LawRegulation the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is However we have very strong grounds to appeal since a we are currently miles away from let alone b we can only borrow for CAPEX as per bond issue and the policy of allmost bankslending institutions with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from We intend to fight this one very hard using all the externalindependant help we can get As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut This has not happened SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases Having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much smaller and hence managable

Gus nron Angela nron Sharonda StephensCorpEnron Eric NRON Amber CT Merle CT Kerryann CT Makiko nron Subject Budget UpdateHiring Committee Formation In a recent organizational memo I mentioned what a great time this is to b e at Enron I believe that more strongly than ever given the new markets we are entering the enhanced focus of the company on markets and regions arou nd the world that best fit with our core competencies and the phenomenal grow th of the company perhaps best evidenced by the earnings report of the first quarter But there are challenges as well California and its regional a nd global implications and the general market conditions that have brought ou r stock price well off its recent highs With respect to each of these and other challenges there are invariably opportunities for example the enhanced opportunity for the FERC to finish the job of opening wholesale electricity markets in the context of California and in the context of a lower stock price a recognition that accelerated growth in earnings will bring the stock price to new highs in the not too distant future One way that earnings can grow beyond Wall Street expectations is by bringing a bit more discipline to how all of us spend money at Enron We in Government Affairs can point to many efforts and processes that have been designed to instill that spending and resource allocation discipline in the last few years We have always done our part but there is always more that can be done To increase earnings and correspondingly the stock price I recently met with various Government Affairs group heads to discuss ways Government Affairs can do things better and more cost effectively We looked at group travel costs outside services and other budget items Attached for your review and use is a copy of a new Travel Policy and new Cell Phone Policy which I believe will ensure consistency across the group and deliver cost savings Such travel policies already exist in various regions such as Enr on Europe Regional Business Unit travel policies will continue to be applied where applicable Further as a result of our review of the budget we have identified saving s across the North American group in excess of million dollars USD Th is is in addition to almost million dollars USD by which the Enron Europe Government Affairs budget has been reduced as well as significant reductio ns that have occurred in the South American group Finally I have also decide d to create a global government affairs hiring committee which will evaluate the need for any proposed hires new and existing positions The purpose of the committee will be to assess whether the need is valid and assuming it is determine the most effective way to fill the position By encompassing a crosssection of the Government Affairs group globally it is my hope that we will arrive at better hiring decisions The hiring committee will consist of Aleck Dadson Toronto Sue Nord Houston Jim Steffes Houston Paul Dawson London Doug Wood London Nick ODay Tokyo Sergio Assad S ao Paulo Linda Robertson Washington and myself The committee will meet on an as needed basis I believe that these changes will allow us all the opportunity to provide more cost effective and efficient service to the business units we support I encourage each of you to review the new policies and provide feedback Thank you

nron cc james d nron Subject Re CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Alan DayAhead HourAhead Markets Market separation rules aside we should resist any mandatory DayAhead Market The results for dayahead clearing markets have been bid gaming to influence price in the dayahead market In PJM and NYISO parties submit false load and generation schedules in set price most often this is a low ball load estimatethen later the true load is scheduled I think there is less of a problem with the hourahead market since the opportunity to submit a false bid to set price and then replace it later is very limited if not nonexistent Unbalance Schedules The general direction we are going for Eastern ISOs is to allow unbalance schedules in the realtime market Tim indicated a few weeks ago that he still wants this feature Normally there would be no imbalance penalties however when reserve margins are so slim that the systems security is in jeopardy penalties would be triggered The result is that parties can choose to use the realtime market or they can choose bilateral schedules or a combination They are not compelled to do either As long as reserves are adequate then why should we care Unit Commitment Although not on your list I think the primary problems that the DayAhead Market is trying to solve is unit commitment While this may be the intended purpose it hasnt worked very well Centralized unit commitment would address the problem but then the operator decisions have a large impact on prices without having any consequences We need a proposal for making sure that resources will be on line and that the operator knows they will be in place A possible approach may be as follows as suggested by Mike Roan The Operator publishes its expected realtime price for the next hours based on information supplied by generators regarding their availability and bid price one part and the ISOs estimate of hourly loads The estimates roll forward every hour to that a continuous two day outlook is provided to all market participants The Operator provides the demandsupply curves to the market so everyone has the same information As units are committed and load forecast is adjusted the estimate of realtime prices changes providing signals for units to use in deciding to commit units As expected price rises more units are committed and price goes down At a given point in time such as hours ahead of realtime the Operator locks units in as committed If there are inadequate units committed it pays to add capacity call contracts If not enough is voluntarily bid the Operator orders units on under emergency rules contained in interconnectionintegration agreements with the generators The cost of the call contracts or of units ordered on is included in the cost of imbalance energy in realtime for the hours for which those costs were incurred This procedure is a continuous bid type of approach which provides signals and information to the market It or some other procedure like it is needed to address the Operators concerns that it will be able to operate the system and to deal with the overly conservative tendencies of a notforprofit ISO Steve Alan Comnes PM To james d nron cc Subject CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Here are some initial reactions and questions to the CAISO market stabilization plan which is attached Give me or Sue Mara your comments and then we can turn it into message points for media advocacy folks In addition to reviewing the plan I listened in to part of a stakeholder call that occured Friday am PST DRAFT MESSAGE POINTS With limited exceptions the plan does nothing to increase supply or decrease demand It primarily addresses costs and market stability INTERESTING QUOTES Over the edge into cost based regulation Duke Power Although the plan provides for cost control and for improving market stability whatever that means the ISO staffer Byron Wortz who presented the study admitted it Will do nothing to increase supply this summer A staffer Lorenzo stated paraphrased all out of state suppliers are cost of service based and do not need to recieve market based rates ON SPECIFICS The Ugly Resourcespecific cost based bid caps RSBC or bid caps cost of service regulation that disincent supply The ISO will hold instate resources hostagecuts any exports when reserves fall below a stated critera Imports can only participate as price takers Thus if the highestcost instate resource is below the opportunity cost of power needed imports will not come in this will decrease supply Staffer stated ISO hopes to sign longer term deals if necessary to secure outofstate power but acknowledged the proposal needs more work The Bad The ISO is considering pay as bid which is complex and does not increase supply However on the call they said they are leaing to a single price auction However with bid caps the market will still be distorted The Good The ISO wll implement an hourly dayahead and hourahead market essentially filling a void created by the PXs demise Enron has strongly advocated market seperation in the past but do we want to consider supporting a day ahead market Market separation rules MSR ISO is leaning towards option in which SCs submit bundled schedules but that market seperation would be suspended after congestion process is conducted ie final schedules may be imbalanced What do we think of this

DenneCorpEnron on PM From Ann M Schmidt PM To Karen NRON cc Subject Poll Articles NEWS Davis Puts His Spin on Energy Crisis He polls voters sends faxes defending charges of critics Patrick Hoge Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright While Gov Gray Davis is searching for answers to Californias energy crisis he also has been polling voters about potential solutions and trying to convince opinion leaders that he is taking decisive action Interviews with Davis pollster lawmakers and those on the receiving end of the publicity campaign offer a glimpse into the tight link between policy and politics as the governor negotiates a way out of the power crunch Recently as independent polls showed that in Californians believe the crisis is the states No problem Davis backed a bill that could lead to electricity rate increases after saying for months that he opposed them Last week the governors office sent a statement titled Meeting the Energy Challenge to nearly opinion leaders and decision makers touting Davis record and refuting the claims of critics that he has been too slow to act Fortuna Union High School District Superintendent Dennis Hanson whose Humboldt County office received one of the faxes was offended by what he saw as an attempt to manipulate him Making it political provides no solutions said an angry Hanson whose district is preparing for a utility bill that is potentially higher this school year The unwillingness of anybody to take responsibility boggles my mind Davis aides insist that the governor isnt preoccupied with the views of voters despite his political operation polling Californians on the energy issue since last summer Some critics suggest that Davis fear of a public backlash has exacerbated his usual cautiousness and contributed to the energy crisis Thats ridiculous said Davis pollster Paul Maslin We do a lot less polling than anybody understands For significant periods of this entire issue there has not been polling going on Its a far cry from the perception from recent White Houses where everything must be polled The surveys of Californians which are paid for by Davis political campaign help frame issues and determine factors such as the publics willingness to conserve Maslin said The responses are not used to guide intricate policy decisions he said At the same time however Maslin explained that his polling shows residents clearly dont want electricity service left to the vagaries of the free market they want some kind of government command of the system and theyre willing to trade some rate increases for greater certainty If you had to boil it down they want greater control here somehow Maslin said I think the governor and the Legislature would be well served to listen to that right now In fact recent proposals by the governor and the Legislature such as the states billion purchase of longterm power or a state takeover of the utility transmission system show they are addressing such concerns Political analysts say Davis polling reflects a pervasive reliance by politicians at all levels of government on public opinion a focus that is not helpful when confronting a highly technical matter like energy policy Indeed Davis is not alone Democratic Assembly leaders recently used their own poll numbers to convince colleagues to spend million in taxpayer money to buy electricity Polls are crude instruments that pose simplistic questions to people who are often uneducated about the issues said Professor Barbara OConnor director of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State University Sacramento I think its the absence of leadership when politicians base their behavior on what people think of them OConnor said The state GOP might agree The party bucked the desires of Republican legislative leaders and aired radio commercials last week criticizing Davis leadership on the crisis The ads began running yesterday in the Bay Area At least one Republican had asked the party to discontinue the ads So far Maslin said Californians are not blaming Davis for the power problems because they see it as caused by deregulation legislation passed in when Republican Gov Pete Wilson was in office The way they view the current governor and the Legislature is Fix it he said Were not blaming you because we understand it didnt happen on your watch but get us out of this mess As the states chief executive Davis has been criticized by industry executives analysts lawmakers and regulators for his wariness In contrast the statement Davis officials faxed last week to police and fire chiefs heads of school districts municipal officials and the like praised his bold decisive leadership Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio described the fax as a tool for public education Its just information Its not political at all Maviglio said This is part of a continuing effort the governors office has done to inform the community about the governors actions and policies It was first used during the education proposals last year Outraged utility executives meanwhile said the governors fax wrongly blamed them for not being more proactive Im appalled by reading such a statement said Harold Ray executive vice president of Southern California Edison Co Ray was particularly irked by a passage about longterm contracts between the states major utilities and power providers The governors fax claimed that since Davis appointed Loretta Lynch president of the states Public Utilities Commission last March the PUC has approved every request from the utilities for authority to sign longterm contracts in a timely fashion Ray claims that signing contracts directly with generators instead of through a staterun exchange could have saved his company about billion On Aug the commission ostensibly gave the utilities authority to sign such contracts but Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co executives say the regulators refused to approve contracts or to provide guidelines for them The commissions energy division is supervised by Lynch She told The Chronicle that the utilities should simply have acted without guidance from commission staff Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza chair of the Rules Committee said he believes that the PUC has contributed to energy market dysfunction in recent years Cardoza however praised Davis for now aggressively pursuing new generating plants in California and said any spin control will likely be irrelevant in the end because results will be what matters I dont think any amount of damage control is going to fix things if we dont get control of this said Cardoza If were able to solve the problem we get kudos If we dont we get dinged PHOTO Caption Gov

Press Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved NEWS Californians Cast a Cold Eye At Power Crisis Polls Find Shortages join education as top concern Katherine Seligman Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright Yes the energy crisis is serious but most Californians see it as a plot by power companies seeking to jack up utility bills according to the latest energy poll by the Field Institute The poll released today found Californians growing more dubious about the roots of the socalled crisis More than half of those surveyed percent said the shortage amounts to an attempt to raise rates rather than an emergency born purely from lack of generating sources or from increased demand Real or fabricated the public is overwhelmingly concerned about the crisis and is staying tuned to news of blackouts and energy grids both the Field Poll and one from the Public Policy Institute of California show almost everyone is following the news In fact the energy shortage has joined education as a top concern for Californians according to the Public Policy Institute poll also released today That poll reveals that almost percent of Californians say energy is a big problem and only about half of those polled think economic good times are ahead a drop from percent in August And state residents are mad at just about everyone for the energy situation and the looming shortages The public is in a pretty foul mood said Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll They blame just about everybody The public is pretty cynical about how we got to this situation When asked whos to blame for the situation about threequarters of those in the Field Poll pointed the finger at failure to build new power plants the states private utility companies and the state Public Utilities Commission More than percent blamed the federal Energy Regulatory Commission the state Legislature activist groups that blocked new plant construction and an increase in industrial energy use Gov Gray Davis however came out on top of the electrical heap with only percent blaming him for the current situation Fifty three percent blamed his predecessor Pete Wilson Most respondents said they take at least somewhat seriously the potential for utility company bankruptcy and with it the threat of blackouts When it comes to solving the problem most want the state government to step in and become a middleman buying electricity for the utility companies the Field Poll found Davis has argued that the state can get better prices because of its good credit rating The electricity would then be sold to the power companies In order to fix the problem most Californians percent think the state should go back to regulating the energy industry Only percent of those in the Field Poll said they think the crisis can be solved without reregulation In the Public Policy Institutes poll only percent advocated reregulation with percent favoring the construction of more power plants and percent leaning toward more conservation Although they are deeply concerned about the energy shortage most Californians responded in the Field Poll that they dont want air quality standards relaxed to produce more electricity Only percent thought that solution was satisfactory But when asked if air quality standards should be relaxed in some areas to get older plants functioning and to speed approval of new plants Californians were more divided Almost half percent approved of that strategy Fortysix percent opposed it The energy problems dont bode well for the state according to those surveyed by the Public Policy Institute Eightytwo percent said they thought the issue will damage the states economy in the next few years with more than half saying it will hurt the economy a great deal Californians are deeply worried about the implications of this crisis for the state economy and their own pocketbooks said the institutes survey director Mark Baldassare Right now they are still holding out hope but their optimism as well as the political fortunes of state leaders may suffer if they fail to see some action soon The private nonpartisan research institute conducted its survey

AM Steve Hopper AM To Ricky Lynn nron John nron Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Peter E nron Ray RANSREDES Doug RANSREDES cc Subject Dave Barrys thoughts on CAs electrical storage Feb PM The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite By DAVE BARRY When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California our reaction as concerned Americans is Ha ha No seriously we are alarmed Because history teaches us that whatever happens to California smog road rage tofu coffee that is mainly air cell phones the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive Shirley MacLaine people taking inline skating seriously grandmothers sporting new and flagrantly inappropriate bosoms eventually happens to the rest of the nation Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage and see if we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and change the subject Our first question is What exactly is electricity When we look in our Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia we see that electricity is defined as a class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge and from the interaction of charges What does this mean in laypersons terms It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big fat dope Because we know from our juniorhighschool science training that electricity is actually a fastmoving herd of electrons which are tiny onecelled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside a doubleA battery where they die within minutes Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited This was proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during a thunderstorm and was almost killed Encouraged by this success Franklin went on to conduct many more electrical experiments including rolling a hoop in a thunderstorm playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing somersaults in a thunderstorm Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm leaving the authorities with no choice but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France Nevertheless Franklin had proved an important scientific point which is that electricity originates inside clouds There it forms into lightning which is attracted to the earth by golfers After entering the ground the electricity hardens into coal which when dug up by power companies and burned in big ovens called generators turns back into electricity which is sent in the form of volts also known as watts or rpm for short through special wires with birds sitting on them to consumers homes where it is transformed by TV sets into commercials for beer which passes through the consumers and back into the ground thus completing what is known as a circuit But enough technical talk The problem is that California is running out of electricity The situation is so bad that in some hospitals they dont have enough electricity to power those electricshock paddles that get peoples hearts started again instead the doctors and nurses have to hold hands scuff their feet across the carpet in unison then shout CLEAR as they touch the patients chest Who is responsible for Californias electricity shortage You could blame the power companies or you could blame environmental wackos or you could blame the entertainment industry which uses more than billion watts of electricity per day just to blowdry the hair of the cast of Dawsons Creek or you could blame why not the Firestone tire company But you would be wrong Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity shortage is college students I base this statement on widespread observation of my son who is a college student and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium If my son is in a room then every electrical device within yards of that room every light computer television stereo video game microwave oven etc will be running My son doesnt even have to turn the devices on they activate themselves spontaneously in response to his presence Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in California which according to my research is EDITOR Please insert number of college students in California and you see my point which is EDITOR Please insert my point The question is What can the rest of us do to help our fellow countrypersons in California The answer is that we can send them our spare electricity Just imagine what would happen if all the households in this great and generous nation got out their extension cords and connected them together forming a giant electrical chain of helping across the fruited plain to the Golden State Millions of people would be turned into generous smoking lumps of carbon thats what So maybe we should go with Plan B This involves building a really really really big kite KnightRidder Tribune

fuel declarations but price declarations Section Resolution The rules do not mention any cap for price declarations Goal Daily fuel declaration The month fuel declaration was replaced by a daily price

the power market on June the Executive Branch issued Decree which completes the deregulation process of the power industry initiated in and amends Electricity Law On June the Minister of Infrastructure issued Resolution setting forth the guidelines for the future regulation of the Decree The Secretariat of Energys resolution that will regulate the Decree will be effective as from September All agents of the electric sector will be invited to comment the terms of regulatory decree although such comments will be used for informational purposes and will not bind the Secretariat of Energy to make any changes whatsoever to its original document Although Decree No is effective as from today there are doubts in the industry as to whether it will be abolished in the future by Congress The reason for this uncertainty is that such Decree was issued within the framework of the Competitivity Law by which Congress delegated to the Executive Branch its powers to legislate specifically on changes required to transform the economy Although this Decree and the changes it fosters indirectly affect the economy since the law it amends is not purely economical it may be questioned There is no term within which Congress may exercise this right Please find a summary of the relevant changes below Generators Remuneration Forward Market freely negotiated Spot Market only payment of hourly spot price at each node Hourly Spot Price determined by price offers based on demand and transportation constraints Daily Declarations The day before the daily dispatch each Generator shall declare its price offers for each peak shoulder and valley hour at its node declare its maximum operating limits and minimum available capacity offer all of its available capacity Calculation of Hourly Spot Price HSP HSP shall be calculated by the OED according to procedure to be determined by the Secretariat of Energy not based on marginal costs as it is today Prices shall be calculated at each node before the initiation of each day At the end of each day prices shall be recalculated based off real operations on the system Spot Market Generators and Marketers shall be paid on an hourly basis according to the volume of energy delivered at the node which shall be valued at the HSP If distributors large users andor marketers enter into supply contracts then to clear transactions on the spot market the OED shall consider that the sellers MarketersGenerators assume their clients payment obligations before the market On spot market transactions Generators shall not

difference in energy prices between two nodes related to the link and the capacity charge of the relevant transmission system In the case of Existing transportation lines under concession these rights

established by the Secretariat of Energy In order for the price under these contracts to be passed through to their end users tariffs the relation between the term of the contracts and the volume purchased must comply with a chart that basically states that the greater the term of the contract the lesser the percentage of contracted energy In any case the total amount of energy contracted can not be in excess of the total demand of users that cant transact on the MEM Forced Dispatch Distributors may request forced dispatch of certain units The Distributor that requests forced dispatch is

BestardENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Jose Bestard PM To Cuiaba LT cc Sergio nron Orlando nron Joe nron Subject Cuiaba Issues July situation Topic I Amendment We spent the morning perfecting Aditivo with Furnas to cover the situation where the commissioning plan did not go as scheduled It was signed early afternoon and sent to Eletrobras The Eletrobras Diretoria had not followed this issue closely and need legal clearance Furnas and the Ministry Perazzo called to give it priority Late at night we received word that the parecer opinion was ready and that it the Anex would signed by Eletrobras next Monday and entered into their Board meeting next Tuesday Petrobras sent us the letter we asked but took out of their version a key word only Only refers that they will not go after us for nonpayment if Furnas does not pay In the letter they also stated that they will commence the loading operation at their own risk Saturday This was requested by Perazzo to save logistical time because it takes three days to get to Cuiaba from the refinery Advised Laine of the situation to check Monday how many trucks were loaded and in transit We contacted Perazzo through Sergio Assad to get his word that there would not be a last minute hitch otherwise we may have to refuse to take the diesel and would create a BIG PR problem for all Topic III Consent Package Opinions Aditivo Consent Furnas came in with the list of issues they wanted to discuss I instead insisted that we treat this meeting as a continuation of the MME meeting and follow the Agenda by looking at the Consent document package actually go over the text that they find objectionable and if it the text had a direct link with any of their issues we would discuss and examine the relative positions What they told me is what they have told me before that some of the issues have nothing to do with the Consent but they want it as a condition to agree to the package Which is fine to me because it will make it clear to the government what we have been saying they want to change the deal In Furnas defense I need to add that they feel they have been handed a bad contract and they want regulatory relief which it has been granted on a casebycase basis in other deals So part of their strategy is to force MME or Aneel to provide some tariff relief I asked them to list out the key issues with the Consent Old a the days additional time Furnas b The guarantee substitution at the time of privatization c the lenders involvement on contract changes we do not want to go to Washington to negotiate Newer d giving up their right to ask Aneel to homologar ratify rather than registrar contract changes big risk for us I believe the have more direct issues We go back to Rio Monday another holiday down the drain and Tuesday to complete the list Topic II Regulatory conflicts Jose

cc Subject Background Information France Electricity Background The Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate d monopoly business to a competitive market A segment of electricity users n ow have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers The emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded wholesale market Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in December member states were obliged to transpose the directive into national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February The directive sets out a threetiered approach to the liberalisation of electricity supply markets Stage one entered into effect on February and calls for the opening of of national markets based on the average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more than GWh per year The degree of opening will increase over six years by lowering the community consumption threshold to GWh in market opening and to GWh in market opening Distributor access i s a matter for each member state The implementation of a new directive expected in will improve the conditions for a liberalized market At present the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe r states The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are Germany Austria Spain and the Netherlands Switzerland although it is no t an EU member state is integral to market developments France although having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive has proven to open up their market more than expected Current Market EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France the largest power producer in the world with TWh generated in and the largest exporter in Europe net exports reached TWh in Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EDF is a vertically integrated company with services and products in generation supply transmission a nd distribution Finally this historical supplier is a State Entity th e French State owns EDFs capital A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TW h hydro Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their production to EDF under a regulated tariff More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession areas The French System Operator RTE was created on July and is a subdivision of EDF although it is unbundled in terms of management and accounting A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the transitional regime which varies according to the voltage used and is base d on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract for thei r maximum transmission capacity Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW A threeyear framework contract eg by way of a Master Agreement with a minimum term of three years is required for eligible customers but eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a threeyear contractual framework Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created balancing responsibility contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which compel s the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a tolerance level or MW Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France the ability to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process t he availability of market prices and optional structures The establishment of balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France and this through the exchange of blocks from one perimeter to another Blocs are only exchangeable on dayahead bases but intraday procedures are expected to be implemented Al l transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number of players for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is a balancing responsible actor in France and closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was t he very first new entrant to trade power buysell in France late Future Developments Frances size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for trading on the Continent It is Europes second largest electricity market with net consumption including industrial onsite consumption totalling over TWh in The increase of physical trading envisaged capacity release by EDF and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to the further development of the market Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producer consumer and providing it with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EDF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met Recently the European Commission has asked EDF to auction MW of virtu al capacity through VPP auctions starting in September representing abou t of the market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity Regulatory Environment The goal of Directive EC concerning the internal market in electricit y is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness in the face of price decreases France has transposed the directive however certain imperfection with regards to nondiscriminatory access and the leve l of liberalisation still exist The French Electricity law was passed on February a year later th an required by the EU establishing a transitional regime for third party acce ss TPA Several application decrees still have to be passed including transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers The current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per ye ar and per site and represents about eligible clients and sites Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible consumption of customers located in their concession areas The French powe r market is effectively open to some competition and about eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive by Feb as the French governme nt declined a quicker opening of the power market The two main authorities which oversee the industry are the CRE Commissi on de Regulation de lElectricit is the official regulatory body and the ministry of industry The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo r nondiscriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation tariffs The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for IPPs and for determining eligibility issues RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK Italy and Spain interconnectors On the remaining borders capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule and congestion fees are levied at the margin which favours longterm contracts and historical players In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to RTE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports an d imports However an intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity is likely to be changed by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision of the Ministry of Industry the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers a maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Although the interpretation of this law is unclear a recent statement by M Tuot Director General of the CRE implies that these restrictions only apply to French authorised producers and thus not to foreignbased energy companies or other nonproducing entities Thus these restrictions do not apply to ECTR L as we are not registered in France In addition French IPPs are free to sell and export their production Eligible customers who are physically connected to the Grid have to contract for transmission visvis RTE Contrat Made Traders such as ECTRL are not required to have such a transmission contract as they do no t consume the power they purchase Only a balancing responsibility

Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EdF owns of power generation and of distribution A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TWh hydro Other small IPPs sell their production to EdF under a regulated tariff There has been significan t development of cogeneration projects since There is now MW of installed capacity thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe r generated from cogeneration units at a preferable is preferable the correct word tariff In the view of the transposition of the EU Electricity Directive into French law this purchase obligation ceased to apply for new large projects over MW from st Jan More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession

limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t o eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Trading is currently defined as the conditio ns of power purchase for resale to eligible customers These Trading restrictions however do not apply to ECTRL as we are not registered in France IPPs are free to sell and export power The French System Operator RTE was created on July and is a subdivision of EdF although it is unbundled in terms of management and accounting A postage stamp tariff was implemented under the transitional regime which varies according to the voltage usedand which is based on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract transmission u p to the maximum capacity that they will use RTE purchases excess capacity available through transmission contracts at fixed prices which represents about half of the market price Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created programme responsible contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which allow the aggregation of imbalance charges for differen t eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Eligible customers who are physically connected to the Grid have to contract for transmission visvis RTE Contrat Made Traders such as ECTRL are not required to have such a transmission contract as they do no t consume the power they purchase Only a programme responsible contract coupled with grid access contracts import export andor transit are required by RTE A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer setting up new conditions for transmission transits and exports under a permanent regime It is likely that this new tariff will implement a injection delive ry calculation factor Imports which are allocated on a prorata basis are free of transmission charges Programme responsible contracts have established the basis of trading in France through the exchange of blocs from one perimeter to another Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is programme responsible in France Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule by RTE and congestion fees are levied at the margin whi ch favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player s In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R TE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports and imports This allocation rule is likely to change by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come The CRE Commission de Regulation de lElectricite is the offical regulato ry body which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues while IPP licenses and eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry Business Opportunity Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France the abilit y to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage between the flexibility of the industrial process market prices and optional structures The establishment of programme responsible contrac ts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France ECTRL closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was the very first new entrant to trade power buysell in Franc e late An intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports and is expected to soon be extended to exchange of blocs in France Liquidity has been dramatically increasing although the market remains dominated by the historical player thanks to RTE capacity auctions for auction has not been implemented on Spanish side yet QUERY do we need this bit in brackets What does it add Cant we just delete it Or i s it a note and someone has to write some better text here It just does no t read correctly in English owing to its place in the sentence at present UK Italy and Spain interconnectors RTE tenders for HV Grid losses industrial s switching and new players coming into the market In addition the Europea n Commission has determined that EdF will auction MW of virtual capacity through VPP and PPA auctions in September representing about of t he market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity A network code is currently under discussion between market players and RTE Future Development It is forecasted that both balancing market and spot exchange market will b e implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options which will be exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producerconsumer thus providing RTE with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services The Some of the spot market volume is expected to be run by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EdF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met ECTRL has actively been lobbying in order to have fa ir and transparent rules implemented for every player in the market and has actively contributed for a spot market to take place However thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly The Gas Market Situation A transitional regime was implemented on August by direct applicati on of the EU Directive thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose consumption is over million cubic meters pa The eligibility threshold will be reduced to million cubic meters in and million cubic mete rs in No gas law has been passed yet forecasted mid and its is expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end A zonaldistancerelated tariff was disclosed published on July by GdFTransportation A permanent entryexit tariff structure is likely to be developed for Charges for imbalances are expensive and access t o storage is restricted GdFTrading however has published conditions for balancing services There is only one trading Hub for France located at the FrenchBelgian bord er BlaregniesTaisniSres Due to the distancerelated nature of the transportation tariff competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a re located not too far less than about Km from the FrenchBelgian border The main imports into France are for high cal gas and GdF has published th e conditions for high callow cal gas swaps As there is not yet a new gas law in France a Projet de Loi was approved on th May transposing the EU Gas Directive into domestic legislation the Regulatory Commission has not been appointed todate and the official regulatory body remains the Ministry of Industry Although current conditions do not facilitate full requirement supply to customers from new entrants it is already possible to optimise gas supply through import of blocs for part or full supply ECTRL was the first new entrant to supply gas at the French border and more recently into France ECTRLs cumulative volume of gas trades so far totals million cubic meters

Preferably before we meet again with PWCRoth In addition to Pierres comments the PIM also states that strike prices at least are subject to Trustee review but a number of areas need to be questioned Capacity Release Phasing PIM confirms the year period of the remdey b ut also says a review can be requested after years Bruno you need to review the remedy doc but I do not see how a year phasing of capacity release complies with the remedy at least in spirit We would suggest there is no impediment to offering the FULL remedy in a single phase If theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to release unsold capacity on a monthly or annual basis through the year period The current proposal is no more than EdF trying to minimise capaci ty release andor extract max value cant blame them for trying but it is not what we want or what remedy requires EdFs only real argument is that phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblit y threshold drops in France However since eligible demand already exceeds total capacity release this would limit development of competition to existing eligibles As a minimum the release programme for all capacity should be clearly defined up front not at the whim of EdF Peter though ts on this and how in context of remedy we can argue for accelerated single phase auction with possible reauctioning of unsold capacity over years Auction Process qualifying criteria likely to be more defined in IM bu t no obvious problems here I am less sure about nature of auction process We obviously need to think it through more but why not just have a simple process based on single sealed bids or an electronic bid process The us e of price clock controlled by the auctioneer may allow a reserve price to be set which is clearly not the intent of the remedy this should be set at zero for all product groups not subjectively to ensure excess demand but only for certain groups Product Specs need to

financial services regulation and ecommerce will be implicated He says Tom argues that we must liberalise energy to realise these objectives As I understand Tom and he can speak for himself if we do

Japan etc I am assuming we do not need it in the USA even today the WTO initiative ie liberalisation of energy siervices would be of little value by the time it was implemented I had apparently mistakenly at least assumed that liberalisation of energy siervices at a minimum meant thirdparty access to transmission networks If not then what the heck are we doing in this fight BUT as you will see from the incoming below when Paul Hennemeyer of my team here in London joined Joe and Bob Fisher in Geneva to do a presentation on liberalisation of energy services in WTO it provoked a letter to which Joe responded saying that the US Energy Services Coalition has NEVER taken a position on thrid party access and it is doubtful they could agree to such a position Joe agreed and said this was just an Enron company position You can probably guess my position on this but I thought I would forward this to you for your information and if warranted follow up as the conversations we have had

concern It is helpful and hopefully will help us in future presentations I know it will help me Regards Joe Raggett Brian AM To cc Arscott Lyn Subject RE Energy Services Joe Having raised the matter covered by the exchange of emails between yourself and Lyn I feel I should clarify my observations of the meeting at the WTO I am confident that the WTO representatives were better informed and enlightened by the presentations given by the ESC I am sure they were also struck as was I by Pauls enthusiastic explanation of the range of innovative energy services offered by Enron What sparked my concern was the reference to access to energy networks Personally I do not and more importantly nor does OGP take a position on TPA in the EU to which you refer in your communication Even more so in the context of the WTO because it has never been discussed I surmise though that other ESC members would have similar reservations My concerns were heightened by questions on the subject raised by one or two of our interlocutors This part of the discussion then broadened somewhat and included information about a court case in Germany to overcome entrenched opposition to TPA by certain network operators I know not whom I believe it would be a pity if the broader aspects of energy services supported generally by the ESC became subsumed by a debate on TPA to either nationally or privately owned networks to which some WTO governments outside Europe and the United States maybe opposed While I detected concerns about this in the questions asked I dont think that the baby was thrown away with the bathwater It is my view however that the ESC should be cautious about raising an issue which some governments may perceive to be outside what they think is a more reasonable agenda and to which rightly or wrongly they have antipathy My concern is that this may then be used to forestall the worthy and perhaps more achievable objectives of the ESC to include the wide range of services advocated in the main by Paul and by the others who presented I most certainly have a positive view on the value of your work and I hope this helps I am not sure at this point whether I will be

would respond that we want to see the EU electricity and natural gas directives fully implemented The EU had asked member countries to fully implement transmission access and it is being accomplished in a phased in approach Some member countries are doing it in a way that makes energy services possible some to a less degree and so far France has not adopted the implementing legislation which is a subject of concern to the EU The opening up of markets to the maximum degree possible is a broad goal of the Energy Services Coalition recognizing that this is a position that has to be negotiated We

James D ES Richard ES cc Joe nron Sarah nron Charles CT Richard CT Subject Joes group accomplishments in SO FAR Per Jims request for the database I dont know if you want to put the values that Kevin is giving into the database Completed the negotiations and FERC filing of the Next Hour Market scheduling proposal When implemented scheduled for June this will provide one stop shopping for next hour business Ties OASIS and TAGGING together into one request Also if a tranmission provider cuts the transmission the PSE only pays for his actual use versus what he originally scheduled This will speed up the ability to schedule the next hour nonfirm This order is an important recognition by FERC that its OATT did not cover hourly which we complained about alot at FERCs hotline last summer Successful in obtaining the release of all ISN system information to marketers in the WSCC region This was an individual effort by Dick that h as been benificial for our traders in the WEST Successfully prevented the WS CC Operating Committee from taking action that would have reversed this effort Assisted in getting the initial control areas in SERC approved last ye ar and preventing ATC changes this year and OC changes that would have negated the Control Area effort Dick served as Co CHAIR of the ISO committee that put the SPP contract in place that eliminated MW mile pricing in SPP and will serve as the basis for SPPs RTO Dick was appointed to the NERC Control Area Task Force which was formed as a result of our the success of the Enron Control Areas in TVA and have s o far been successful in keeping this effort so that it is non punitive Thi s has turned into a very positive process that may result in a new configuration of the NERC relibiability effort Dicks made comments to ENTERGY that helped push Entergy into filing their new scheduling procedure ultimate source and sink with FERC This was initially going to be implemented unilaterally March without a FERC filing and Enron would have been forced into an after the fact complaint situation at FERC where we are not allowed to get damages that we would hav e incurred in the meantime See Comm Masseys concurrence in Aquila v Enter gy about the lack of incentive to file complaints Kevin Presto said that winning the protest at FERC due would be worth MM On TECO revised its proposed generator imbalance charge from minute by minute to hourly accountability notably TECO revised its propos al before FERC issued an order based on the EPSA protest herein We worked wi th EPSA to file an EPSA protest to TECOs proposal We didnt like TECO s proposal but had commercial concerns about filing a protest in our own name since Enron is working with TECO on a project We were able to get EPSA to protest this issue in TECOs initial filing Enron is planning to site generation in Florida but we dont have the value on this win yet FERC issued a NOPR on January proposing to revise the way it assesses annual charges to public utilities Enron along with several other participants Dynegy Koch APX Citizens NP Energy Sonat a nd Williams filed a petition for rulemaking with FERC in August requesting FERC to revise its methodology for assessing annual charges arguing that FERCs current system of assessing annual charges on sales for resale of power discourages trading impedes reliance on competitive market s for power and could create competitive advantages for utilities over new power marketers entering the market We proposed that FERC either assess i ts costs on transmission only or reallocate the amounts that it collects through sales transactions versus transmission transactions Although FERC does not grant our petition and in fact dismisses it as moot the petition served its purpose In the NOPR FERC notes that because most of its time is spent on transmission issues a point that we made in the Petition it is appropria te to assess costs only on the MWh of electric energy transmitted in interstat e commerce by public utilities Under the current assessment system FERC divides its costs between transmission and sales Now FERC is proposing to collect its costs solely through transmission FERC justifies this change because it spends most of its time on transmission issues and because transmission providers can collect the fees through transmission charges assessed to users of the grid FERC proposes to asses its costs to unbundled wholesale transmission unbundled retail transmission and bundled wholesale power sales Bundled native load transactions will apparently avoid assessments of any FERCrelated costs however EPSA and Enron are protesting this issue at FERC Jim Steffes has been working on a calculation of additional value Interconnection Policy Utilizing EPSA efforts including Sarahs meeting with FERC we got the policy statement we urged FERC to put forth in the forum we suggested ie an existing proceeding in the Tennessee Powe r order where FERC said interconnection procedures should follow the pro form a tariff including that a generator doesnt have to request transmission and interconnection at the same time We worked with EPSA to draft the Model interconnection agreement that EPSA filed at FERC in the Entergy interconnection proposal AEPCSW order approved the merger but accepted intervenors testimony showing market power and conditioned merger on an independent calculation of ATC postings which we proposed and independent market monitor soon after the merger occurs with RTO participation by Kevin Presto said the independent ATC calculation is worth MM to Enron Note we are going to propose MAIN instead of SPP which AEP chose Kev in said that AEPs ATC calculation can trump all interfaces in ECAR so this h as a positive effect not just on AEP but on all of ECAR MAPP FERC further order on refunds MAPP refused to refund moni es that it was unable to collect from a nonjurisdictional member transmission owner NPPD EPMI filed a protest to MAPPs refund report arguing that MAPP was ordered to make full refunds and it violated that order FERC agreed with Enron and rejected MAPPs refund report FERC said MAPP must refun d the full amount to transmission customers whether or not it was able to collec t that money from NPPD Results in another of refunds for EPMI Sarah is working on the PGE sale

Approved Excellent and congratulations Ray Alvarez PM To Steven J nron Richard nron Linda NRON James D nron cc Harry nron Robert NeustaedterENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Tariffs Approved The rate case that the governmental affairs group filed in January on behalf of Transredes has come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates will go into effect towards the end of this month The rates are not much lower than what we filed for and represent a very significant increase over the previous rates The tariff methodology and revised regulations put into effect by the Supreme Decree were followed to the letter by the regulator despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down The deliverables here were to obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would make the company financeable rescue it from dire financial straits and file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the tariff methodology This second deliverable has now been completed Transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the uncertainty about rates it is my understanding that the financial market loved the ruling and that Transredes sold million worth of bonds in about minutes This ruling should also significantly increase Transredess market value relative to Enrons efforts to sell its interest in the company Forwarded by Ray AlvarezNAEnron on AM Doug Farmer PM To Peter E WeidlerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Jan van den RANSREDES John RANSREDES Cyro RANSREDES Pedro RANSREDES Fernando RANSREDES Subject Tariffs Approved Gentlemen I am delighted to report that SIRESE approved substantial increases in TRs tariffs consistent with the Law and Regulation The details are Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved Increase TRCLHB Proposed TRCLHB Increase Gas Export including surcharges excluding RG Liquids Domestic Liquids Export CLHBs tariffs were also approved as follows As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB comparable with our liquids domestic We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach their conclusions on Monday but our inteligence suggests the following Export gas volumes increased to TR capacity and GSA Cuiaba assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes RG Compresion project deleted Interest rate reduced to or ie the rate in our bond issue Liquids expansion in the South reduced Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between concesions OCC in service date slipped from to DebtEquity assumption changed from to Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows Volumes Covered by rule we can blete but can expect little back here Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the short term ie RG Compression not worth fighting for since we dont even have the support of BG Interest Rate Well get this back when we do a tariff revision and actual rates are used When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we have concrete grounds ie commision costs etc are omited Liquids Expansion in the South Here we intend to do a detailed analysis of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquidsgas production will be shut in If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected producers PB BG Vintage and Chaco We will then write to those producerscopy SIRESE VMEH etc stating that on their recommendation the project scope was reduced by SIRESE We will give them an estimate of the lost liquidsgas production in both volume and cash terms resultant from this decision We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal Continuity of Service Capex We need to see the detail here We will take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared to compromise our safety and environmental standards We need to see exactly what has been removed but my thought is that if that means we are unable to provide some services eg LPG transportation or the continued operation of some liquids laterals we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the decision Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the SIRESE budget process OPEX need to see the detail on Monday OCC will not appeal we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC strategy DebtEquity ratio Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance with the LawRegulation the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is However we have very strong grounds to appeal since a we are currently miles away from let alone b we can only borrow for CAPEX as per bond issue and the policy of allmost bankslending institutions with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from We intend to fight this one very hard using all the externalindependant help we can get As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut This has not happened SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases Having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much smaller and hence managable increases Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume assumptions ie the worst case Regards Doug

Gus nron Angela nron Sharonda StephensCorpEnron Eric NRON Amber CT Merle CT Kerryann CT Makiko nron Subject Budget UpdateHiring Committee Formation In a recent organizational memo I mentioned what a great time this is to b e at Enron I believe that more strongly than ever given the new markets we are entering the enhanced focus of the company on markets and regions arou nd the world that best fit with our core competencies and the phenomenal grow th of the company perhaps best evidenced by the earnings report of the first quarter But there are challenges as well California and its regional a nd global implications and the general market conditions that have brought ou r stock price well off its recent highs With respect to each of these and other challenges there are invariably opportunities for example the enhanced opportunity for the FERC to finish the job of opening wholesale electricity markets in the context of California and in the context of a lower stock price a recognition that accelerated growth in earnings will bring the stock price to new highs in the not too distant future One way that earnings can grow beyond Wall Street expectations is by bringing a bit more discipline to how all of us spend money at Enron We in Government Affairs can point to many efforts and processes that have been designed to instill that spending and resource allocation discipline in the last few years We have always done our part but there is always more that can be done To increase earnings and correspondingly the stock price I recently met with various Government Affairs group heads to discuss ways Government Affairs can do things better and more cost effectively We looked at group travel costs outside services and other budget items Attached for your review and use is a copy of a new Travel Policy and new Cell Phone Policy which I believe will ensure consistency across the group and deliver cost savings Such travel policies already exist in various regions such as Enr on Europe Regional Business Unit travel policies will continue to be applied where applicable Further as a result of our review of the budget we have identified saving s across the North American group in excess of million dollars USD Th is is in addition to almost million dollars USD by which the Enron Europe Government Affairs budget has been reduced as well as significant reductio ns that have occurred in the South American group Finally I have also decide d to create a global government affairs hiring committee which will evaluate the need for any proposed hires new and existing positions The purpose of the committee will be to assess whether the need is valid and assuming it is determine the most effective way to fill the position By encompassing a crosssection of the Government Affairs group globally it is my hope that we will arrive at better hiring decisions The hiring committee will consist of Aleck Dadson Toronto Sue Nord Houston Jim Steffes Houston Paul Dawson London Doug Wood London Nick ODay Tokyo Sergio Assad S ao Paulo Linda Robertson Washington and myself The committee will meet on an as needed basis I believe that these changes will allow us all the opportunity to provide more cost effective and efficient service to the business units we support I encourage each of you to review the new policies and provide feedback Thank you

nron cc james d nron Subject Re CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Alan DayAhead HourAhead Markets Market separation rules aside we should resist any mandatory DayAhead Market The results for dayahead clearing markets have been bid gaming to influence price in the dayahead market In PJM and NYISO parties submit false load and generation schedules in set price most often this is a low ball load estimatethen later the true load is scheduled I think there is less of a problem with the hourahead market since the opportunity to submit a false bid to set price and then replace it later is very limited if not nonexistent Unbalance Schedules The general direction we are going for Eastern ISOs is to allow unbalance schedules in the realtime market Tim indicated a few weeks ago that he still wants this feature Normally there would be no imbalance penalties however when reserve margins are so slim that the systems security is in jeopardy penalties would be triggered The result is that parties can choose to use the realtime market or they can choose bilateral schedules or a combination They are not compelled to do either As long as reserves are adequate then why should we care Unit Commitment Although not on your list I think the primary problems that the DayAhead Market is trying to solve is unit commitment While this may be the intended purpose it hasnt worked very well Centralized unit commitment would address the problem but then the operator decisions have a large impact on prices without having any consequences We need a proposal for making sure that resources will be on line and that the operator knows they will be in place A possible approach may be as follows as suggested by Mike Roan The Operator publishes its expected realtime price for the next hours based on information supplied by generators regarding their availability and bid price one part and the ISOs estimate of hourly loads The estimates roll forward every hour to that a continuous two day outlook is provided to all market participants The Operator provides the demandsupply curves to the market so everyone has the same information As units are committed and load forecast is adjusted the estimate of realtime prices changes providing signals for units to use in deciding to commit units As expected price rises more units are committed and price goes down At a given point in time such as hours ahead of realtime the Operator locks units in as committed If there are inadequate units committed it pays to add capacity call contracts If not enough is voluntarily bid the Operator orders units on under emergency rules contained in interconnectionintegration agreements with the generators The cost of the call contracts or of units ordered on is included in the cost of imbalance energy in realtime for the hours for which those costs were incurred This procedure is a continuous bid type of approach which provides signals and information to the market It or some other procedure like it is needed to address the Operators concerns that it will be able to operate the system and to deal with the overly conservative tendencies of a notforprofit ISO Steve Alan Comnes PM To james d nron cc Subject CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Here are some initial reactions and questions to the CAISO market stabilization plan which is attached Give me or Sue Mara your comments and then we can turn it into message points for media advocacy folks In addition to reviewing the plan I listened in to part of a stakeholder call that occured Friday am PST DRAFT MESSAGE POINTS With limited exceptions the plan does nothing to increase supply or decrease demand It primarily addresses costs and market stability INTERESTING QUOTES Over the edge into cost based regulation Duke Power Although the plan provides for cost control and for improving market stability whatever that means the ISO staffer Byron Wortz who presented the study admitted it Will do nothing to increase supply this summer A staffer Lorenzo stated paraphrased all out of state suppliers are cost of service based and do not need to recieve market based rates ON SPECIFICS The Ugly Resourcespecific cost based bid caps RSBC or bid caps cost of service regulation that disincent supply The ISO will hold instate resources hostagecuts any exports when reserves fall below a stated critera Imports can only participate as price takers Thus if the highestcost instate resource is below the opportunity cost of power needed imports will not come in this will decrease supply Staffer stated ISO hopes to sign longer term deals if necessary to secure outofstate power but acknowledged the proposal needs more work The Bad The ISO is considering pay as bid which is complex and does not increase supply However on the call they said they are leaing to a single price auction However with bid caps the market will still be distorted The Good The ISO wll implement an hourly dayahead and hourahead market essentially filling a void created by the PXs demise Enron has strongly advocated market seperation in the past but do we want to consider supporting a day ahead market Market separation rules MSR ISO is leaning towards option in which SCs submit bundled schedules but that market seperation would be suspended after congestion process is conducted ie final schedules may be imbalanced What do we think of this

into the tight link between policy and politics as the governor negotiates a way out of the power crunch Recently as independent polls showed that in Californians believe the crisis is the states No problem Davis backed a bill that could lead to electricity rate increases after saying for months that he opposed them Last week the governors office sent a statement titled Meeting the Energy Challenge to nearly opinion leaders and decision makers touting Davis record and refuting the claims of critics that he has been too slow to act Fortuna Union High School District Superintendent Dennis Hanson whose Humboldt County office received one of the faxes was offended by what he saw as an attempt to manipulate him Making it political provides no solutions said an angry Hanson whose district is preparing for a utility bill that is potentially higher this school year The unwillingness of anybody to take responsibility boggles my mind Davis aides insist that the governor isnt preoccupied with the views of voters despite his political operation polling Californians on the energy issue since last summer Some critics suggest that Davis fear of a public backlash has exacerbated his usual cautiousness and contributed to the energy crisis Thats ridiculous said Davis pollster Paul Maslin We do a lot less polling than anybody understands For significant periods of this entire issue there has not been polling going on Its a far cry from the perception from recent White Houses where everything must be polled The surveys of Californians which are paid for by Davis political campaign help frame issues and determine factors such as the publics willingness to conserve Maslin said The responses are not used to guide intricate policy decisions he said At the same time however Maslin explained that his polling shows residents clearly dont want electricity service left to the vagaries of the free market they want some kind of government command of the system and theyre willing to trade some rate increases for greater certainty If you had to boil it down they want greater control here somehow Maslin said I think the governor and the Legislature would be well served to listen to that right now In fact recent proposals by the governor and the Legislature such as the states billion purchase of longterm power or a state takeover of the utility transmission system show they are addressing such concerns Political analysts say Davis polling reflects a pervasive reliance by politicians at all levels of government on public opinion a focus that is not helpful when confronting a highly technical matter like energy policy Indeed Davis is not alone Democratic Assembly leaders recently used their own poll numbers to convince colleagues to spend million in taxpayer money to buy electricity Polls are crude instruments that pose simplistic questions to people who are often uneducated about the issues said Professor Barbara OConnor director of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State University Sacramento I think its the absence of leadership when politicians base their behavior on what people think of them OConnor said The state GOP might agree The party bucked the desires of Republican legislative leaders and aired radio commercials last week criticizing Davis leadership on the crisis The ads began running yesterday in the Bay Area At least one Republican had asked the party to discontinue the ads So far Maslin said Californians are not blaming Davis for the power problems because they see it as caused by deregulation legislation passed in when Republican Gov Pete Wilson was in office The way they view the current governor and the Legislature is Fix it he said Were not blaming you because we understand it didnt happen on your watch but get us out of this mess As the states chief executive Davis has been criticized by industry executives analysts lawmakers and regulators for his wariness In contrast the statement Davis officials faxed last week to police and fire chiefs heads of school districts municipal officials and the like praised his bold decisive leadership Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio described the fax as a tool for public education Its just information Its not political at all Maviglio said This is part of a continuing effort the governors office has done to inform the community about the governors actions and policies It was first used during the education proposals last year Outraged utility executives meanwhile said the governors fax wrongly blamed them for not being more proactive Im appalled by reading such a statement said Harold Ray executive vice president of Southern California Edison Co Ray was particularly irked by a passage about longterm contracts between the states major utilities and power providers The governors fax claimed that since Davis appointed Loretta Lynch president of the states Public Utilities Commission last March the PUC has approved every request from the utilities for authority to sign longterm contracts in a timely fashion Ray claims that signing contracts directly with generators instead of through a staterun exchange could have saved his company about billion On Aug the commission ostensibly gave the utilities authority to sign such contracts but Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co executives say the regulators refused to approve contracts or to provide guidelines for them The commissions energy division is supervised by Lynch She told The Chronicle that the utilities should simply have acted without guidance from commission staff Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza chair of the Rules Committee said he believes that the PUC has contributed to energy market dysfunction in recent years Cardoza however praised Davis for now aggressively pursuing new generating plants in California and said any spin control will likely be irrelevant in the end because results will be what matters I dont think any amount of damage control is going to fix things if we dont get control of this said Cardoza If were able to solve the problem we get kudos If we dont we get dinged PHOTO Caption Gov

Press Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved NEWS Californians Cast a Cold Eye At Power Crisis Polls Find Shortages join education as top concern Katherine Seligman Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright Yes the energy crisis is serious but most Californians see it as a plot by power companies seeking to jack up utility bills according to the latest energy poll by the Field Institute The poll released today found Californians growing more dubious about the roots of the socalled crisis More than half of those surveyed percent said the shortage amounts to an attempt to raise rates rather than an emergency born purely from lack of generating sources or from increased demand Real or fabricated the public is overwhelmingly concerned about the crisis and is staying tuned to news of blackouts and energy grids both the Field Poll and one from the Public Policy Institute of California show almost everyone is following the news In fact the energy shortage has joined education as a top concern for Californians according to the Public Policy Institute poll also released today That poll reveals that almost percent of Californians say energy is a big problem and only about half of those polled think economic good times are ahead a drop from percent in August And state residents are mad at just about everyone for the energy situation and the looming shortages The public is in a pretty foul mood said Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll They blame just about everybody The public is pretty cynical about how we got to this situation When asked whos to blame for the situation about threequarters of those in the Field Poll pointed the finger at failure to build new power plants the states private utility companies and the state Public Utilities Commission More than percent blamed the federal Energy Regulatory Commission the state Legislature activist groups that blocked new plant construction and an increase in industrial energy use Gov Gray Davis however came out on top of the electrical heap with only percent blaming him for the current situation Fifty three percent blamed his predecessor Pete Wilson Most respondents said they take at least somewhat seriously the potential for utility company bankruptcy and with it the threat of blackouts When it comes to solving the problem most want the state government to step in and become a middleman buying electricity for the utility companies the Field Poll found Davis has argued that the state can get better prices because of its good credit rating The electricity would then be sold to the power companies In order to fix the problem most Californians percent think the state should go back to regulating the energy industry Only percent of those in the Field Poll said they think the crisis can be solved without reregulation In the Public Policy Institutes poll only percent advocated reregulation with percent favoring the construction of more power plants and percent leaning toward more conservation Although they are deeply concerned about the energy shortage most Californians responded in the Field Poll that they dont want air quality standards relaxed to produce more electricity Only percent thought that solution was satisfactory But when asked if air quality standards should be relaxed in some areas to get older plants functioning and to speed approval of new plants Californians were more divided Almost half percent approved of that strategy Fortysix percent opposed it The energy problems dont bode well for the state according to those surveyed by the Public Policy Institute Eightytwo percent said they thought the issue will damage the states economy in the next few years with more than half saying it will hurt the economy a great deal Californians are deeply worried about the implications of this crisis for the state economy and their own pocketbooks said the institutes survey director Mark Baldassare Right now they are still holding out hope but their optimism as well as the political fortunes of state leaders may suffer if they fail to see some action soon The private nonpartisan research institute conducted its survey

AM Steve Hopper AM To Ricky Lynn nron John nron Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Peter E nron Ray RANSREDES Doug RANSREDES cc Subject Dave Barrys thoughts on CAs electrical storage Feb PM The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite By DAVE BARRY When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California our reaction as concerned Americans is Ha ha No seriously we are alarmed Because history teaches us that whatever happens to California smog road rage tofu coffee that is mainly air cell phones the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive Shirley MacLaine people taking inline skating seriously grandmothers sporting new and flagrantly inappropriate bosoms eventually happens to the rest of the nation Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage and see if we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and change the subject Our first question is What exactly is electricity When we look in our Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia we see that electricity is defined as a class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge and from the interaction of charges What does this mean in laypersons terms It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big fat dope Because we know from our juniorhighschool science training that electricity is actually a fastmoving herd of electrons which are tiny onecelled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside a doubleA battery where they die within minutes Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited This was proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during a thunderstorm and was almost killed Encouraged by this success Franklin went on to conduct many more electrical experiments including rolling a hoop in a thunderstorm playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing somersaults in a thunderstorm Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm leaving the authorities with no choice but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France Nevertheless Franklin had proved an important scientific point which is that electricity originates inside clouds There it forms into lightning which is attracted to the earth by golfers After entering the ground the electricity hardens into coal which when dug up by power companies and burned in big ovens called generators turns back into electricity which is sent in the form of volts also known as watts or rpm for short through special wires with birds sitting on them to consumers homes where it is transformed by TV sets into commercials for beer which passes through the consumers and back into the ground thus completing what is known as a circuit But enough technical talk The problem is that California is running out of electricity The situation is so bad that in some hospitals they dont have enough electricity to power those electricshock paddles that get peoples hearts started again instead the doctors and nurses have to hold hands scuff their feet across the carpet in unison then shout CLEAR as they touch the patients chest Who is responsible for Californias electricity shortage You could blame the power companies or you could blame environmental wackos or you could blame the entertainment industry which uses more than billion watts of electricity per day just to blowdry the hair of the cast of Dawsons Creek or you could blame why not the Firestone tire company But you would be wrong Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity shortage is college students I base this statement on widespread observation of my son who is a college student and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium If my son is in a room then every electrical device within yards of that room every light computer television stereo video game microwave oven etc will be running My son doesnt even have to turn the devices on they activate themselves spontaneously in response to his presence Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in California which according to my research is EDITOR Please insert number of college students in California and you see my point which is EDITOR Please insert my point The question is What can the rest of us do to help our fellow countrypersons in California The answer is that we can send them our spare electricity Just imagine what would happen if all the households in this great and generous nation got out their extension cords and connected them together forming a giant electrical chain of helping across the fruited plain to the Golden State Millions of people would be turned into generous smoking lumps of carbon thats what So maybe we should go with Plan B This involves building a really really really big kite KnightRidder Tribune

fuel declarations but price declarations Section Resolution The rules do not mention any cap for price declarations Goal Daily fuel declaration The month fuel declaration was replaced by a daily price

the power market on June the Executive Branch issued Decree which completes the deregulation process of the power industry initiated in and amends Electricity Law On June the Minister of Infrastructure issued Resolution setting forth the guidelines for the future regulation of the Decree The Secretariat of Energys resolution that will regulate the Decree will be effective as from September All agents of the electric sector will be invited to comment the terms of regulatory decree although such comments will be used for informational purposes and will not bind the Secretariat of Energy to make any changes whatsoever to its original document Although Decree No is effective as from today there are doubts in the industry as to whether it will be abolished in the future by Congress The reason for this uncertainty is that such Decree was issued within the framework of the Competitivity Law by which Congress delegated to the Executive Branch its powers to legislate specifically on changes required to transform the economy Although this Decree and the changes it fosters indirectly affect the economy since the law it amends is not purely economical it may be questioned There is no term within which Congress may exercise this right Please find a summary of the relevant changes below Generators Remuneration Forward Market freely negotiated Spot Market only payment of hourly spot price at each node Hourly Spot Price determined by price offers based on demand and transportation constraints Daily Declarations The day before the daily dispatch each Generator shall declare its price offers for each peak shoulder and valley hour at its node declare its maximum operating limits and minimum available capacity offer all of its available capacity Calculation of Hourly Spot Price HSP HSP shall be calculated by the OED according to procedure to be determined by the Secretariat of Energy not based on marginal costs as it is today Prices shall be calculated at each node before the initiation of each day At the end of each day prices shall be recalculated based off real operations on the system Spot Market Generators and Marketers shall be paid on an hourly basis according to the volume of energy delivered at the node which shall be valued at the HSP If distributors large users andor marketers enter into supply contracts then to clear transactions on the spot market the OED shall consider that the sellers MarketersGenerators assume their clients payment obligations before the market On spot market transactions Generators shall not receive payments for any other concept Forward Market Generators and Marketers may enter into contracts with distributors marketers and large users at freely negotiated prices and terms Marketers Are now considered agents of the electric sector May enter into forward contracts andor carry our purchase and sale transactions on the spot market at the node HSP Must declare their offer and demand at each node of the system Their obligations shall be similar to those of Generators and Distributors when they transact at the MEM Congestion Rights Right to receive profits resulting from the difference in energy prices between two nodes related to the link and the capacity charge of the relevant transmission system In the case of Existing transportation lines under concession these rights

established by the Secretariat of Energy In order for the price under these contracts to be passed through to their end users tariffs the relation between the term of the contracts and the volume purchased must comply with a chart that basically states that the greater the term of the contract the lesser the percentage of contracted energy In any case the total amount of energy contracted can not be in excess of the total demand of users that cant transact on the MEM Forced Dispatch Distributors may request forced dispatch of certain units The Distributor that requests forced dispatch is

Furnas to cover the situation where the commissioning plan did not go as scheduled It was signed early afternoon and sent to Eletrobras The Eletrobras Diretoria had not followed this issue closely and need legal clearance Furnas and the Ministry Perazzo called to give it priority Late at night we received word that the parecer opinion was ready and that it the Anex would signed by Eletrobras next Monday and entered into their Board meeting next Tuesday Petrobras sent us the letter we asked but took out of their version a key word only Only refers that they will not go after us for nonpayment if Furnas does not pay In the letter they also stated that they will commence the loading operation at their own risk Saturday This was requested by Perazzo to save logistical time because it takes three days to get to Cuiaba from the refinery Advised Laine of the situation to check Monday how many trucks were loaded and in transit We contacted Perazzo through Sergio Assad to get his word that there would not be a last minute hitch otherwise we may have to refuse to take the diesel and would create a BIG PR problem for all Topic III Consent Package Opinions Aditivo Consent Furnas came in with the list of issues they wanted to discuss I instead insisted that we treat this meeting as a continuation of the MME meeting and follow the Agenda by looking at the Consent document package actually go over the text that they find objectionable and if it the text had a direct link with any of their issues we would discuss and examine the relative positions What they told me is what they have told me before that some of the issues have nothing to do with the Consent but they want it as a condition to agree to the package Which is fine to me because it will make it clear to the government what we have been saying they want to change the deal In Furnas defense I need to add that they feel they have been handed a bad contract and they want regulatory relief which it has been granted on a casebycase basis in other deals So part of their strategy is to force MME or Aneel to provide some tariff relief I asked them to list out the key issues with the Consent Old a the days additional time Furnas b The guarantee substitution at the time of privatization c the lenders involvement on contract changes we do not want to go to Washington to negotiate Newer d giving up their right to ask Aneel to homologar ratify rather than registrar contract changes big risk for us I believe the have more direct issues We go back to Rio Monday another holiday down the drain and Tuesday to complete the list Topic II Regulatory conflicts Jose

cc Subject Background Information France Electricity Background The Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate d monopoly business to a competitive market A segment of electricity users n ow have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers The emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded wholesale market Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in December member states were obliged to transpose the directive into national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February The directive sets out a threetiered approach to the liberalisation of electricity supply markets Stage one entered into effect on February and calls for the opening of of national markets based on the average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more than GWh per year The degree of opening will increase over six years by lowering the community consumption threshold to GWh in market opening and to GWh in market opening Distributor access i s a matter for each member state The implementation of a new directive expected in will improve the conditions for a liberalized market At present the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe r states The EU countries farthest along the

have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers The emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded wholesale market Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in December member states were obliged to transpose the directive into national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February The directive sets out a threetiered approach to the liberalisation of electricity supply markets Stage one entered into effect on February and calls for the opening of of national markets based on the average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more than GWh per year The degree of opening will increase over six years by lowering the community consumption threshold to GWh in market opening and to GWh in market opening Distributor access i s a matter for each member state The implementation of a new directive expected in will improve the conditions for a liberalized market At present the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe r states The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are Germany Austria Spain and the Netherlands Switzerland although it is no t an EU member state is integral to market developments France although having chosen to comply with the

nuclear production The historical supplier who is at the same time the largest exporter of power in Europe net exports reached TWh in is a direct emanation from the French State who owns EdF capital Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EdF owns of power generation and of distribution A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TWh hydro Other small IPPs sell their production to EdF under a regulated tariff There has been significan t development of cogeneration projects since There is now MW of installed capacity thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe r generated from cogeneration units at a preferable is preferable the correct word tariff In the view of the transposition of the EU Electricity Directive into French law this purchase obligation ceased to apply for new large projects over MW from st Jan More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession area Regulatory Environment The French Electricity law was passed on February implementing regulated third party access TPA in France under a transitional regime T he law was approved one year late failing to meet the required EU deadline Dozens Dozens I would replace this with Several of application decrees still have to be passed including tariffs to eligible industrials The French power market is open to competition however About eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier Current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per year and per site representing about eligible clients and sites The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive in Feb as the French government

contractual framework New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision from the Ministry of Industry which is the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t o eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Trading is currently defined as the conditio ns of power purchase for resale to eligible customers These Trading restrictions however do not apply to ECTRL as we are not registered in France IPPs are free to sell and export power The French System

varies according to the voltage usedand which is based on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract transmission u p to the maximum capacity that they will use RTE purchases excess capacity available through transmission contracts at fixed prices which represents about half of the market price Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created programme responsible

Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is programme responsible in France Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule by RTE and congestion fees are levied at the margin whi ch favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player s In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R TE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports and imports This allocation rule is likely to change by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come The CRE Commission de Regulation de lElectricite is the offical regulato ry body which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues while IPP licenses and eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry Business Opportunity Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France the abilit y to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage between the flexibility of the industrial process market prices and optional structures The establishment of programme responsible contrac ts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France ECTRL closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was the very first new entrant to trade power buysell in Franc e late An intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports and is expected to soon be extended to exchange of blocs in France Liquidity has been dramatically increasing although the market remains dominated by the historical player thanks to RTE capacity auctions for auction has not been implemented on Spanish side yet QUERY do we need this bit in brackets What does it add Cant we just delete it Or i s it a note and someone has to write some better text here It just does no t read correctly in English owing to its place in the sentence at present UK Italy and Spain interconnectors RTE tenders for HV Grid losses industrial s switching and new players coming into the market In addition the Europea n Commission has determined that EdF will auction MW of virtual capacity through VPP and PPA auctions in September representing about of t he market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity A network code is currently under discussion between market players and RTE Future Development It is forecasted that both balancing market and spot exchange market will b e implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options which will be exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producerconsumer thus providing RTE with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services The Some of the spot market volume is expected to be run by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EdF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met ECTRL has actively been lobbying in order to have fa ir and transparent rules implemented for every player in the market and has actively contributed for a spot market to take place However thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly The Gas Market Situation A transitional regime was implemented on August by direct applicati on of the EU Directive thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose consumption is over million cubic meters pa The eligibility threshold will be reduced to million cubic meters in and million cubic mete rs in No gas law has been passed yet forecasted mid and its is expected that the

state Does not appear to be any need to deal with credit support or other regulatory qualifiers such as balancing agreements as yet Mark agree Bruno could you please take care of sending this registration letter agr ee with Pierre who should act as principal contact Establish once and for all the role of Trustee and CRE in the process of approving capacity release phasing auction process for each phase and product specifications AND understand how the consultation process will work once we have the IM Hence need to discuss with MTF then Trustee and CRE asap ie in June if possible Preferably before we meet again with PWCRoth In addition to Pierres comments the PIM also states that strike prices at least are subject to Trustee review but a number of areas need to be questioned Capacity Release Phasing PIM confirms the year period of the remdey b ut also says a review can be requested after years Bruno you need to review the remedy doc but I do not see how a year phasing of capacity release complies with the remedy at least in spirit We would suggest there is no impediment to offering the FULL remedy in a single phase If theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to release unsold capacity on a monthly or annual basis through the year period The current proposal is no more than EdF trying to minimise capaci ty release andor extract max value cant blame them for trying but it is not what we want or what remedy requires EdFs only real argument is that phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblit y threshold drops in France However since eligible demand already exceeds total capacity release this would limit development of competition to existing eligibles As a minimum the release programme for all capacity should be clearly defined up front not at the whim of EdF Peter though ts on this and how in context of remedy we can argue for accelerated single phase auction with possible reauctioning of unsold capacity over years Auction Process qualifying criteria likely to be more defined in IM bu t no obvious problems here I am less sure about nature of auction process We obviously need to think it through more but why not just have a simple process based on single sealed bids or an electronic bid process The us e of price clock controlled by the auctioneer may allow a reserve price to be set which is clearly not the intent of the remedy this should be set at zero for all product groups not subjectively to ensure excess demand but only for certain groups Product Specs need to understand what if anything can be changed here Strikes seem to be subject to Trustee approval but we need to understand what else can be influenced eg within day flex Since we have already covered

Commission i n February to give access to some of its generation capacity as a condition f or EU approval of its purchase of a percent stake in German utility EnBW In the next two years EdF will auction a total of megawatts which include MW of peak capacity sold at a price of euros per megawatt hour MWh and MW of baseload at a price of eight eurosMWh In addition MW of cogeneration production capacity will be made available Production from cogeneration plants is bought by EdF from smalle r producers under longterm contracts With such contracts electricity suppliers and traders will be able to hav e electricity without the technical and operational risks of running a power plant said EdF in a statement The price for cogeneration capacity will be made public a few weeks before the auction as it depends on gas price movements EdF said The auction will take place in several tranches the first one starting in September when MW of peak capacity will be auctioned MW of baselo ad and MW of

nron cc james d nron Subject Re CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Alan DayAhead HourAhead Markets Market separation rules aside we should resist any mandatory DayAhead Market The results for dayahead clearing markets have been bid gaming to influence price in the dayahead market In PJM and NYISO parties submit false load and generation schedules in set price most often this is a low ball load estimatethen later the true load is scheduled I think there is less of a problem with the hourahead market since the opportunity to submit a false bid to set price and then replace it later is very limited if not nonexistent Unbalance Schedules The general direction we are going for Eastern ISOs is to allow unbalance schedules in the realtime market Tim indicated a few weeks ago that he still wants this feature Normally there would be no imbalance penalties however when reserve margins are so slim that the systems security is in jeopardy penalties would be triggered The result is that parties can choose to use the realtime market or they can choose bilateral schedules or a combination They are not compelled to do either As long as reserves are adequate then why should we care Unit Commitment Although not on your list I think the primary problems that the DayAhead Market is trying to solve is unit commitment While this may be the intended purpose it hasnt worked very well Centralized unit commitment would address the problem but then the operator decisions have a large impact on prices without having any consequences We need a proposal for making sure that resources will be on line and that the operator knows they will be in place A possible approach may be as follows as suggested by Mike Roan The Operator publishes its expected realtime price for the next hours based on information supplied by generators regarding their availability and bid price one part and the ISOs estimate of hourly loads The estimates roll forward every hour to that a continuous two day outlook is provided to all market participants The Operator provides the demandsupply curves to the market so everyone has the same information As units are committed and load forecast is adjusted the estimate of realtime prices changes providing signals for units to use in deciding to commit units As expected price rises more units are committed and price goes down At a given point in time such as hours ahead of realtime the Operator locks units in as committed If there are inadequate units committed it pays to add capacity call contracts If not enough is voluntarily bid the Operator orders units on under emergency rules contained in interconnectionintegration agreements with the generators The cost of the call contracts or of units ordered on is included in the cost of imbalance energy in realtime for the hours for which those costs were incurred This procedure is a continuous bid type of approach which provides signals and information to the market It or some other procedure like it is needed to address the Operators concerns that it will be able to operate the system and to deal with the overly conservative tendencies of a notforprofit ISO Steve Alan Comnes PM To james d nron cc Subject CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Here are some initial reactions and questions to the CAISO market stabilization plan which is attached Give me or Sue Mara your comments and then we can turn it into message points for media advocacy folks In addition to reviewing the plan I listened in to part of a stakeholder call that occured Friday am PST DRAFT MESSAGE POINTS With limited exceptions the plan does nothing to increase supply or decrease demand It primarily addresses costs and market stability INTERESTING QUOTES Over the edge into cost based regulation Duke Power Although the plan provides for cost control and for improving market stability whatever that means the ISO staffer Byron Wortz who presented the study admitted it Will do nothing to increase supply this summer A staffer Lorenzo stated paraphrased all out of state suppliers are cost of service based and do not need to recieve market based rates ON SPECIFICS The Ugly Resourcespecific cost based bid caps RSBC or bid caps cost of service regulation that disincent supply The ISO will hold instate resources hostagecuts any exports when reserves fall below a stated critera Imports can only participate as price takers Thus if the highestcost instate resource is below the opportunity cost of power needed imports will not come in this will decrease supply Staffer stated ISO hopes to sign longer term deals if necessary to secure outofstate power but acknowledged the proposal needs more work The Bad The ISO is considering pay as bid which is complex and does not increase supply However on the call they said they are leaing to a single price auction However with bid caps the market will still be distorted The Good The ISO wll implement an hourly dayahead and hourahead market essentially filling a void created by the PXs demise Enron has strongly advocated market seperation in the past but do we want to consider supporting a day ahead market Market separation rules MSR ISO is leaning towards option in which SCs submit bundled schedules but that market seperation would be suspended after congestion process is conducted ie final schedules may be imbalanced What do we think of this

electricity users n ow have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers The emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded wholesale market Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in December member states were obliged to transpose the directive into national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February The directive sets out a threetiered approach to the liberalisation of electricity supply markets Stage one entered into effect on February and calls for the opening of of national markets based on the average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more than GWh per year The degree of opening will increase over six years by lowering the community consumption threshold to GWh in market opening and to GWh in market opening Distributor access i s a matter for each member state The implementation of a new directive expected in will improve the conditions for a liberalized market At present the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe r states The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are Germany Austria Spain and the Netherlands Switzerland although it is no t an EU member state is integral to market developments France although having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive has proven to open up their market more than expected Current Market EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France the largest power producer in the world with TWh generated in and the largest exporter in Europe net exports reached TWh in Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EDF is a vertically integrated company with services and products in generation supply transmission a nd distribution Finally this historical supplier is a State Entity th e French State owns EDFs capital A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TW h hydro Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their production to EDF under a regulated tariff More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession areas The French System Operator RTE was created on July and is a subdivision of EDF although it is unbundled in terms of management and accounting A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the transitional regime which varies according to the voltage used and is base d on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to

contract eg by way of a Master Agreement with a minimum term of three years is required for eligible customers but eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a threeyear contractual framework Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created balancing responsibility contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which compel s the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a tolerance level or MW Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France the ability to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process t he availability of market prices and optional structures The establishment of balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France and this through the exchange of blocks from one perimeter to another Blocs are only

contributed to an increasing number of players for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is

Frances size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for trading on the Continent It is Europes second largest electricity market with net consumption including industrial onsite consumption totalling over TWh in The increase of physical trading envisaged capacity release by EDF and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to the further development of the market Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producer consumer and providing it with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EDF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met Recently the European Commission has asked EDF to auction MW of virtu al capacity through VPP auctions starting in September representing abou t of the market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity Regulatory Environment The goal of Directive EC concerning the internal market in electricit y is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness in the face of price decreases France has transposed the directive however certain imperfection with regards to nondiscriminatory access and the leve l of liberalisation still exist The French Electricity law was passed on February a year later th an required by the EU establishing a transitional regime for third party acce ss TPA Several application decrees still have to be passed including transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers The current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per ye ar and per site and represents about eligible clients and sites Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible consumption of customers located in their concession areas The French powe r market is effectively open to some competition and about eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive by Feb as the French governme nt declined a quicker opening of the power market The two main authorities which oversee the industry are the CRE Commissi on de Regulation de lElectricit is the official regulatory body and the ministry of industry The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo r nondiscriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation tariffs The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for IPPs and for determining eligibility issues RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK Italy and Spain interconnectors On the remaining borders capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule and congestion fees are levied at the margin which favours longterm contracts and historical players In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to RTE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports an d imports However an intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity is likely to be changed by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision of the Ministry of Industry the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers a maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Although the interpretation of this law is unclear a recent statement by M Tuot Director General of the CRE implies that these restrictions only apply to French authorised producers and thus not to foreignbased energy companies or other nonproducing entities Thus these restrictions do not apply to ECTR L as we are not registered in France In addition French IPPs are free to sell and export their production Eligible customers who are physically connected to the Grid have to contract for transmission visvis RTE Contrat Made Traders such as ECTRL are not required to have such a transmission contract as they do no t consume the power they purchase Only a balancing responsibility contract coupled with grid access contracts import export andor transit are required by RTE A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer setting up new conditions for transmission transits and exports under a permanent regime Imports which are allocated on a prorata basis are free of transmission charges A network code is currently under discussion between market players and RTE Market

development of the market Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producer consumer and providing it with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EDF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met Recently the European Commission has asked EDF to auction MW of virtu al capacity through VPP auctions starting in September representing abou t of the market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity Regulatory Environment OLE Object Picture Metafile The goal of Directive EC concerning the internal market in electricit y is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness in the face of price decreases France has transposed the directive however certain imperfection with regards to nondiscriminatory access and the leve l of liberalisation still exist The French Electricity law was passed on February a year later th an required by the EU establishing a transitional regime for third party acce ss TPA Several application decrees still have to be passed including transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers The current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per ye ar and per site and represents about eligible clients and sites Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible consumption of customers located in their concession areas The French powe r market is effectively open to some competition and about eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive by Feb as the French governme nt declined a quicker opening of the power market The two main authorities which oversee the industry are the CRE Commissi on de Regulation de lElectricit is the official regulatory body and the ministry of industry The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo r nondiscriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation tariffs The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for IPPs and for determining eligibility issues RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK Italy and Spain interconnectors On the remaining borders capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule and congestion fees are levied at the margin which favours longterm contracts and historical players In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to RTE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports an d imports However an intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity is likely to be changed by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision of the Ministry of Industry the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers a maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Although the interpretation of this law is unclear a recent statement by M Tuot Director General of the CRE implies that these restrictions only apply to French authorised producers and thus not to foreignbased energy companies or other nonproducing entities Thus these restrictions do not apply to ECTR L as we are not registered in France In addition French IPPs are free to sell and export their production Eligible customers who are physically connected to the Grid have to contract for transmission visvis RTE Contrat Made Traders such as ECTRL are not required to have such a transmission contract as they do no t consume the power they purchase Only a balancing responsibility contract coupled with grid access contracts import export andor transit are required by RTE A new Decree is

May Background France is the second largest country in Europe with million inhabitants EdF who was the monopolistic producer is the largest power producer in th e world with TWh generated in thanks to nuclear production The historical supplier who is at the same time the largest exporter of power in Europe net exports reached TWh in is a direct emanation from the French State who owns EdF capital Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EdF owns of power generation and of distribution A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TWh hydro Other small IPPs sell their production to EdF under a regulated tariff There has been significan t development of cogeneration projects since There is now MW of installed capacity thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe r generated from cogeneration units at a preferable is preferable the correct word tariff In the view of the transposition of the EU Electricity Directive into French law this purchase obligation ceased to apply for new large projects over MW from st Jan More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession area Regulatory Environment The French Electricity law was passed on February implementing regulated third party access TPA in France under a transitional regime T he law was approved one year late failing to meet the required EU deadline Dozens Dozens I would replace this with Several of application decrees still have to be passed including tariffs to eligible industrials The French power market is open to competition however About eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier Current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per year and per site representing about eligible clients and sites The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive in Feb as the French government declined a quicker opening of the power market Eligibility of distribution companies is limited to the eligible consumptio n of customers located in their concession area A threeyear framework contract eg by way of a Master Agreement with a minimum term of three years is required for eligible customers but eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a three year contractual framework New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision from the Ministry of Industry which is the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t o eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Trading is currently defined as the conditio ns of power purchase for resale to eligible customers These Trading restrictions however do not apply to ECTRL as we are not registered in France IPPs are free to sell and export power The French System Operator RTE was created on July and is a subdivision of EdF although it is unbundled in terms of management and accounting A postage stamp tariff was implemented under the transitional regime which varies according to the voltage usedand which is based on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract transmission u p to the maximum capacity that they will use RTE purchases excess capacity available through transmission contracts at fixed prices which represents about half of the market price Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created programme responsible contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which allow the aggregation of imbalance charges for differen t eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Eligible customers who are physically connected to the Grid have to contract for transmission visvis RTE Contrat Made Traders such as ECTRL are not required to have such a transmission contract as they do no t consume the power they purchase Only a programme responsible contract coupled with grid access contracts import export andor transit are required by RTE A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer setting up new conditions for transmission transits and exports under a permanent regime It is likely that this new tariff will implement a injection delive ry calculation factor Imports which are allocated on a prorata basis are free of transmission charges Programme responsible contracts have established the basis of trading in France through the exchange of blocs from one perimeter to another Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is programme responsible in France Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule by RTE and congestion fees are levied at the margin whi ch favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player s In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R TE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports and imports This allocation rule is likely to change by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come The CRE Commission de Regulation de lElectricite is the offical regulato ry body which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues while IPP licenses and eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry Business Opportunity Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France the abilit y to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage between the flexibility of the industrial process market prices and optional structures The establishment of programme responsible contrac ts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France ECTRL closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was the very first new entrant to trade power buysell in Franc e late An intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports and is expected to soon be extended to exchange of blocs in France Liquidity has been dramatically increasing although the market remains dominated by the historical player thanks to RTE capacity auctions for auction has not been implemented on Spanish side yet QUERY do we need this bit in brackets What does it add Cant we just delete it Or i s it a note and someone has to write some better text here It just does no t read correctly in English owing to its place in the sentence at present UK Italy and Spain interconnectors RTE tenders for HV Grid losses industrial s switching and new players coming into the market In addition the Europea n Commission has determined that EdF will auction MW of virtual capacity through VPP and PPA auctions in September representing about of t he market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity A network code is currently under discussion between market players and RTE Future Development It is forecasted that both balancing market and spot exchange market will b e implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options which will be exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producerconsumer thus providing RTE with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services The Some of the spot market volume is expected to be run by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EdF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met ECTRL has actively been lobbying in order to have fa ir and transparent rules implemented for every player in the market and has actively contributed for a spot market to take place However thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly The Gas Market Situation A transitional regime was implemented on August by direct applicati on of the EU Directive thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose consumption is over million cubic meters pa The eligibility threshold will be reduced to million cubic meters in and million cubic mete rs in No gas law has been passed yet forecasted mid and its is expected that the

registration letter agr ee with Pierre who should act as principal contact Establish once and for all the role of Trustee and CRE in the process of approving capacity release phasing auction process for each phase and product specifications AND understand how the consultation process will work once we have the IM Hence need to discuss with MTF then Trustee and CRE asap ie in June if possible Preferably before we meet again with PWCRoth In addition to Pierres comments the PIM also states that strike prices at least are subject to Trustee review but a number of areas need to be questioned Capacity Release Phasing PIM confirms the year period of the remdey b ut also says a review can be requested after years Bruno you need to review the remedy doc but I do not see how a year phasing of capacity release complies with the remedy at least in spirit We would suggest there is no impediment to offering the FULL remedy in a single phase If theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to release unsold capacity on a monthly or annual basis through the year period The current proposal is no more than EdF trying to minimise capaci ty release andor extract max value cant blame them for trying but it is not what we want or what remedy requires EdFs only real argument is that phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblit y threshold drops in France However since eligible demand already exceeds total capacity release this would limit development of competition to existing eligibles As a minimum the release programme for all capacity should be clearly defined up front not at the whim of EdF Peter though ts on this and how in context of remedy we can argue for accelerated single phase auction with possible reauctioning of unsold capacity over years Auction Process qualifying criteria likely to be more defined in IM bu t no obvious problems here I am less sure about nature of auction process We obviously need to think it through more but why not just have a simple process based on single sealed bids or an electronic bid process The us e of price clock controlled by the auctioneer may allow a reserve price to be set which is clearly not the intent of the remedy this should be set at zero for all product groups not subjectively to ensure excess demand but only for certain groups Product Specs need to understand what if anything can be changed here Strikes seem to be subject to Trustee approval but we need to understand what else can be influenced eg within day flex Since we have already covered

auction a total of megawatts which include MW of peak capacity sold at a price of euros per megawatt hour MWh and MW of baseload at a price of eight eurosMWh In addition MW of cogeneration production capacity will be made available Production from cogeneration plants is bought by EdF from smalle r producers under longterm contracts With such contracts electricity suppliers and traders will be able to hav e electricity without the technical and operational risks of running a power plant said EdF in a statement The price for cogeneration capacity will be made public a few weeks before the auction as it depends on gas price movements EdF said The auction will take place in several tranches the first one starting in September when MW of peak capacity will be auctioned MW of baselo ad and MW of

step in the power deregulation process an will allow us to reach some of the goals set for the regulatory group for this year Goal Eliminate or Increase fuel declaration caps there will not be more fuel declarations but price declarations Section Resolution The rules do not mention any cap for price declarations Goal Daily fuel declaration The month fuel declaration was replaced by a daily price declaration Section Resolution Goal Reduce or eliminate the obligation to physically back up agreements with end users or LDCs According to the interpretation of AGEERA Gencos Association we would have been gotten also this objective and marketers may already buy or sell spot as long as the contract with the customer does not have supply guarantee Section Resolution It is not clear in the rule wich is the condition for marketers to buy or sell spot Now the Secretariat of Energy must issue its own Resolution to amend the technical Procedures in line with these rules From the text of Resolution sections c and considerations there would be a good probability to reach other two goals through the Secretariat of Energy rule Reduce minimum term for Output Demand Marketing Agreements to

the power market on June the Executive Branch issued Decree which completes the deregulation process of the power industry initiated in and amends Electricity Law On June the Minister of Infrastructure issued Resolution setting forth the guidelines for the future regulation of the Decree The Secretariat of Energys resolution that will regulate the Decree will be effective as from September All agents of the electric sector will be invited to comment the terms of regulatory decree although such comments will be used for informational purposes and will not bind the Secretariat of Energy to make any changes whatsoever to its original document Although Decree No is effective as from today there are doubts in the industry as to whether it will be abolished in the future by Congress The reason for this uncertainty is that such Decree was issued within the framework of the Competitivity Law by which Congress delegated to the Executive Branch its powers to legislate specifically on changes required to transform the economy Although this Decree and the changes it fosters indirectly affect the economy since the law it amends is not purely economical it may be questioned There is no term within which Congress may exercise this right Please find a summary of the relevant changes below Generators Remuneration Forward Market freely negotiated Spot Market only payment of hourly spot price at each node Hourly Spot Price determined by price offers based on demand and transportation constraints Daily Declarations The day before the daily dispatch each Generator shall declare its price offers for each peak shoulder and valley hour at its node declare its maximum operating limits and minimum available capacity offer all of its available capacity Calculation of Hourly Spot Price HSP HSP shall be calculated by the OED according to procedure to be determined by the Secretariat of Energy not based on marginal costs as it is today Prices shall be calculated at each node before the initiation of each day At the end of each day prices shall be recalculated based off real operations on the system Spot Market Generators and Marketers shall be paid on an hourly basis according to the volume of energy delivered at the node which shall be valued at the HSP If distributors large users andor marketers enter into supply contracts then to clear transactions on the spot market the OED shall consider that the sellers MarketersGenerators assume their clients payment obligations before the market On spot market transactions Generators shall not receive payments for any other concept Forward Market Generators and Marketers may enter into contracts with distributors marketers and large users at freely negotiated prices and terms Marketers Are now considered agents of the electric sector May enter into forward contracts andor carry our purchase and sale transactions on the spot market at the node HSP Must declare their offer and demand at each node of the system Their obligations shall be similar to those of Generators and Distributors when they transact at the MEM Congestion Rights Right to receive profits resulting from the difference in energy prices between two nodes related to the link and the capacity charge of the relevant transmission system In the case of Existing transportation lines under concession these rights belong to the State which will sell them under a public offering called by the Secretariat of Energy Existing transportation lines carried out by an independent transporter shall belong to such transporter New transportation lines shall belong to the owner of the same Expansions Sole Risk Investment Expansions Open to anyone who is interested will require technical and environmental certification of the ENRE and license from the Secretariat of Energy System Reliability Expansions Shall be built by awardee of public tender Distributors Have to satisfy all demand of users within their area that have the choice of independently contracting their supply in the MEM Distributors may offer contracting options with or without supply guaranty these contracts shall be considered special contracts When they contract their demand with Generators andor Marketers the general terms of the contracts as well as the procedure for selecting suppliers will be subject to guidelines established by the Secretariat of Energy In order for the price under these contracts to be passed through to their end users tariffs the relation between the term of the contracts and the volume purchased must comply with a chart that basically states that the greater the term of the contract the lesser the percentage of contracted energy In any case the total amount of energy contracted can not be in excess of the total demand of users that cant transact on the MEM Forced Dispatch Distributors may request forced dispatch of certain units The Distributor that requests forced dispatch is responsible for payment of the same Secretariat of Energy to control if forced dispatch costs are reasonable Such price shall not be transferred to end users and shall not be taken into account to

BestardENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Jose Bestard PM To Cuiaba LT cc Sergio nron Orlando nron Joe nron Subject Cuiaba Issues July situation Topic I Amendment We spent the morning perfecting Aditivo with Furnas to cover the situation where the commissioning plan did not go as scheduled It was signed early afternoon and sent to Eletrobras The Eletrobras Diretoria had not followed this issue closely and need legal clearance Furnas and the Ministry Perazzo called to give it priority Late at night we received word that the parecer opinion was ready and that it the Anex would signed by Eletrobras next Monday and entered into their Board meeting next Tuesday Petrobras sent us the letter we asked but took out of their version a key word only Only refers that they will not go after us for nonpayment if Furnas does not pay In the letter they also stated that they will commence the loading operation at their own risk Saturday This was requested by Perazzo to save logistical time because it takes three days to get to Cuiaba from the refinery Advised Laine of the situation to check Monday how many trucks were loaded and in transit We contacted Perazzo through Sergio Assad to get his word that there would not be a last minute hitch otherwise we may have to refuse to take the diesel and would create a BIG PR problem for all Topic III Consent Package Opinions Aditivo Consent Furnas came in with the list of issues they wanted to discuss I instead insisted that we treat this meeting as a continuation of the MME meeting and follow the Agenda by looking at the Consent document package actually go over the text that they find objectionable and if it the text had a direct link with any of their issues we would discuss and examine the relative positions What they told me is what they have told me before that some of the issues have nothing to do with the Consent but they want it as a condition to agree to the package Which is fine to me because it will make it clear to the government what we have been saying they want to change the deal In Furnas defense I need to add that they feel they have been handed a bad contract and they want regulatory relief which it has been granted on a casebycase basis in other deals So part of their strategy is to force MME or Aneel to provide some tariff relief I asked them to list out the key issues with the Consent Old a the days additional time Furnas b The guarantee substitution at the time of privatization c the lenders involvement on contract changes we do not want to go to Washington to negotiate Newer d giving up their right to ask Aneel to homologar ratify rather than registrar contract changes big risk for us I believe the have more direct issues We go back to Rio Monday another holiday down the drain and Tuesday to complete the list Topic II Regulatory conflicts Jose

Approved Excellent and congratulations Ray Alvarez PM To Steven J nron Richard nron Linda NRON James D nron cc Harry nron Robert NeustaedterENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Tariffs Approved The rate case that the governmental affairs group filed in January on behalf of Transredes has come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates will go into effect towards the end of this month The rates are not much lower than what we filed for and represent a very significant increase over the previous rates The tariff methodology and revised regulations put into effect by the Supreme Decree were followed to the letter by the regulator despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down The deliverables here were to obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would make the company financeable rescue it from dire financial straits and file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the tariff methodology This second deliverable has now been completed Transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the uncertainty about rates it is my understanding that the financial market loved the ruling and that Transredes sold million worth of bonds in about minutes This ruling should also significantly increase Transredess market value relative to Enrons efforts to sell its interest in the company Forwarded by Ray AlvarezNAEnron on AM Doug Farmer PM To Peter E WeidlerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Jan van den RANSREDES John RANSREDES Cyro RANSREDES Pedro RANSREDES Fernando RANSREDES Subject Tariffs Approved Gentlemen I am delighted to report that SIRESE approved substantial increases in TRs tariffs consistent with the Law and Regulation The details are Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved Increase TRCLHB Proposed TRCLHB Increase Gas Export including surcharges excluding RG Liquids Domestic Liquids Export CLHBs tariffs were also approved as follows As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB comparable with our liquids domestic We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach their conclusions on Monday but our inteligence suggests the following Export gas volumes increased to TR capacity and GSA Cuiaba assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes RG Compresion project deleted Interest rate reduced to or ie the rate in our bond issue Liquids expansion in the South reduced Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between concesions OCC in service date slipped from to DebtEquity assumption changed from to Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows Volumes Covered by rule we can blete but can expect little back here Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the short term ie RG Compression not worth fighting for since we dont even have the support of BG Interest Rate Well get this back when we do a tariff revision and actual rates are used When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we have concrete grounds ie commision costs etc are omited Liquids Expansion in the South Here we intend to do a detailed analysis of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquidsgas production will be shut in If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected producers PB BG Vintage and Chaco We will then write to those producerscopy SIRESE VMEH etc stating that on their recommendation the project scope was reduced by SIRESE We will give them an estimate of the lost liquidsgas production in both volume and cash terms resultant from this decision We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal Continuity of Service Capex We need to see the detail here We will take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared to compromise our safety and environmental standards We need to see exactly what has been removed but my thought is that if that means we are unable to provide some services eg LPG transportation or the continued operation of some liquids laterals we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the decision Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the SIRESE budget process OPEX need to see the detail on Monday OCC will not appeal we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC strategy DebtEquity ratio Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance with the LawRegulation the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is However we have very strong grounds to appeal since a we are currently miles away from let alone b we can only borrow for CAPEX as per bond issue and the policy of allmost bankslending institutions with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from We intend to fight this one very hard using all the externalindependant help we can get As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut This has not happened SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases Having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much smaller and hence managable increases Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume assumptions ie the worst case Regards Doug

Gus nron Angela nron Sharonda StephensCorpEnron Eric NRON Amber CT Merle CT Kerryann CT Makiko nron Subject Budget UpdateHiring Committee Formation In a recent organizational memo I mentioned what a great time this is to b e at Enron I believe that more strongly than ever given the new markets we are entering the enhanced focus of the company on markets and regions arou nd the world that best fit with our core competencies and the phenomenal grow th of the company perhaps best evidenced by the earnings report of the first quarter But there are challenges as well California and its regional a nd global implications and the general market conditions that have brought ou r stock price well off its recent highs With respect to each of these and other challenges there are invariably opportunities for example the enhanced opportunity for the FERC to finish the job of opening wholesale electricity markets in the context of California and in the context of a lower stock price a recognition that accelerated growth in earnings will bring the stock price to new highs in the not too distant future One way that earnings can grow beyond Wall Street expectations is by bringing a bit more discipline to how all of us spend money at Enron We in Government Affairs can point to many efforts and processes that have been designed to instill that spending and resource allocation discipline in the last few years We have always done our part but there is always more that can be done To increase earnings and correspondingly the stock price I recently met with various Government Affairs group heads to discuss ways Government Affairs can do things better and more cost effectively We looked at group travel costs outside services and other budget items Attached for your review and use is a copy of a new Travel Policy and new Cell Phone Policy which I believe will ensure consistency across the group and deliver cost savings Such travel policies already exist in various regions such as Enr on Europe Regional Business Unit travel policies will continue to be applied where applicable Further as a result of our review of the budget we have identified saving s across the North American group in excess of million dollars USD Th is is in addition to almost million dollars USD by which the Enron Europe Government Affairs budget has been reduced as well as significant reductio ns that have occurred in the South American group Finally I have also decide d to create a global government affairs hiring committee which will evaluate the need for any proposed hires new and existing positions The purpose of the committee will be to assess whether the need is valid and assuming it is determine the most effective way to fill the position By encompassing a crosssection of the Government Affairs group globally it is my hope that we will arrive at better hiring decisions The hiring committee will consist of Aleck Dadson Toronto Sue Nord Houston Jim Steffes Houston Paul Dawson London Doug Wood London Nick ODay Tokyo Sergio Assad S ao Paulo Linda Robertson Washington and myself The committee will meet on an as needed basis I believe that these changes will allow us all the opportunity to provide more cost effective and efficient service to the business units we support I encourage each of you to review the new policies and provide feedback Thank you

question of what does Joes last comment mean presumably it is that on these issues of WTO I am not competent to advise you on them Leaving that aside I further suspect that he sees me as the bette noir of the WTO ESC effort Finally you might talk to Tom Briggs I think Joe has stood Toms position on its head Joe has argued that we need to be in the ESC because other things we care about like financial services regulation and ecommerce will be implicated He says Tom argues that we must liberalise energy to realise these objectives As I understand Tom and he can speak for himself if we do not get energy services liberalised and the exclusion of thirdparty access is tantamount to not getting energy services liberalised then the makeweight arguments about ecommerce and financial services

Schroeder To Steven J nron Richard nron cc Subject RE Energy Services Tom Briggs was good enough to forward to me a piece of correspondence that Joe Hillings apparently shared with him My lack of enthusiasm for our WTO initiative I know has hardly been masked but frankly what is contained in the incoming letter below I find quite disconcerting I have argued that in our key markets eg Europe Japan etc I am assuming we do not need it in the USA even today the WTO initiative ie liberalisation of energy siervices would be of little value by the time it was implemented I had apparently mistakenly at least assumed that liberalisation of energy siervices at a minimum meant thirdparty access to transmission networks If not then what the heck are we doing in this fight BUT as you will see from the incoming below when Paul Hennemeyer of my team here in London joined Joe and Bob Fisher in Geneva to do a presentation on liberalisation of energy services in WTO it provoked a letter to which Joe responded saying that the US Energy Services Coalition has NEVER taken a position on thrid party access and it is doubtful they could agree to such a position Joe agreed and said this was just an Enron company position You can probably guess my position on this but I thought I would forward this to you for your information and if warranted follow up as the conversations we have had

fax email Brian Thank you for your thoughtful and complete statement of the issue The ESC has not taken any position on the regulatory details of market access nor advocated any such as Third Party Access although Enron certainly has taken a public position at the EU and other venues preferring TPA but willing to be practical about the issue I greatly appreciate your cutting through to the concern It is helpful and hopefully will help us in future presentations I know it will help me Regards Joe Raggett Brian AM To cc Arscott Lyn Subject RE Energy Services Joe Having raised the matter covered by the exchange of emails between yourself and Lyn I feel I should clarify my observations of the meeting at the WTO I am confident that the WTO representatives were better informed and enlightened by the presentations given by the ESC I am sure they were also struck as was I by Pauls enthusiastic explanation of the range of innovative energy services offered by Enron What sparked my concern was the reference to access to energy networks Personally I do not and more importantly nor does OGP take a position on TPA in the EU to which you refer in your communication Even more so in the context of the WTO because it has never been discussed I surmise though that other ESC members would have similar reservations My concerns were heightened by questions on the subject raised by one or two of our interlocutors This part of the discussion then broadened somewhat and included information about a court case in Germany to overcome entrenched opposition to TPA by certain network operators I know not whom I believe it would be a pity if the broader aspects of energy services supported generally by the ESC became subsumed by a debate on TPA to either nationally or privately owned networks to which some WTO governments outside Europe and the United States maybe opposed While I detected concerns about this in the questions asked I dont think that the baby was thrown away with the bathwater It is my view however that the ESC should be cautious about raising an issue which some governments may perceive to be outside what they think is a more reasonable agenda and to which rightly or wrongly they have antipathy My concern is that this may then be used to forestall the worthy and perhaps more achievable objectives of the ESC to include the wide range of services advocated in the main by Paul and by the others who presented I most certainly have a positive view on the value of your work and I hope this helps I am not sure at this point whether I will be

grateful if you could select the restaurant Should another time be more convenient with you please let me know From your response regarding the comment in Geneva I am not feeling that I addressed the specifics of your concern so at the risk of prolonging the pain Ill make another stab at a response If the concern centers on liberalization of transmission access for electricity and natural gas I would respond that we want to see the EU electricity and natural gas directives fully implemented The EU had asked member countries to fully implement transmission access and it is being accomplished in a phased in approach Some member countries are doing it in a way that makes energy services possible some to a less degree and so far France has not adopted the implementing legislation which is a subject of concern to the EU The opening up of markets to the maximum degree possible is a broad goal of the Energy Services Coalition recognizing that this is a position that has to be negotiated We have not recommended any specific regulatory system or regime If I am still missing your concern please bear with me and bring me in closer to any concern that you may have Regards and best wishes Joe

cc Subject Background Information France Electricity Background The Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate d monopoly business to a competitive market A segment of electricity users n ow have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers The emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded wholesale market Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in December member states were obliged to transpose the directive into national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February The directive sets out a threetiered approach to the liberalisation of electricity supply markets Stage one entered into effect on February and calls for the opening of of national markets based on the average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more than GWh per year The degree of opening will increase over six years by lowering the community consumption threshold to GWh in market opening and to GWh in market opening Distributor access i s a matter for each member state The implementation of a new directive expected in will improve the conditions for a liberalized market At present the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe r states The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are Germany Austria Spain and the Netherlands Switzerland although it is no t an EU member state is integral to market developments France although having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive has proven to open up their market more than expected Current Market EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France the largest power producer in the world with TWh generated in and the largest exporter in Europe net exports reached TWh in Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EDF is a vertically integrated company with services and products in generation supply transmission a nd distribution Finally this historical supplier is a State Entity th e French State owns EDFs capital A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TW h hydro Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their production to EDF under a regulated tariff More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession areas The French System Operator RTE was created on July and is a subdivision of EDF although it is unbundled in terms of management and accounting A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the transitional regime which varies according to the voltage used and is base d on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract for thei r maximum transmission capacity Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW A threeyear framework contract eg by way of a Master Agreement with a minimum term of three years is required for eligible customers but eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a threeyear contractual framework Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created balancing responsibility contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which compel s the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a tolerance level or MW Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France the ability to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process t he availability of market prices and optional structures The establishment of balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France and this through the exchange of blocks from one perimeter to another Blocs are only exchangeable on dayahead bases but intraday procedures are expected to be implemented Al l transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number of players for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is a balancing responsible actor in France and closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was t he very first new entrant to trade power buysell in France late Future Developments Frances size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for trading on the Continent It is Europes second largest electricity market with net consumption including industrial onsite consumption totalling over TWh in The increase of physical trading envisaged capacity release by EDF and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to the further development of the market Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producer consumer and providing it with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EDF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met Recently the European Commission has asked EDF to auction MW of virtu al capacity through VPP auctions starting in September representing abou t of the market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity Regulatory Environment The goal of Directive EC concerning the internal market in electricit y is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness in the face of price decreases France has transposed the directive however certain imperfection with regards to nondiscriminatory access and the leve l of liberalisation still exist The French Electricity law was passed on February a year later th an required by the EU establishing a transitional regime for third party acce ss TPA Several application decrees still have to be passed including transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers The current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per ye ar and per site and represents about eligible clients and sites Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible consumption of customers located in their concession areas The French powe r market is effectively open to some competition and about eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive by Feb as the French governme nt declined a quicker opening of the power market The two main authorities which oversee the industry are the CRE Commissi on de Regulation de lElectricit is the official regulatory body and the ministry of industry The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo r nondiscriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation tariffs The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for IPPs and for determining eligibility issues RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK Italy and Spain interconnectors On the remaining borders capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule and congestion fees are levied at the margin which favours longterm contracts and historical players In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to RTE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports an d imports However an intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity is likely to be changed by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision of the Ministry of Industry the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers a maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Although the interpretation of this law is unclear a recent statement by M Tuot Director General of the CRE implies that these restrictions only apply to French authorised producers and thus not to foreignbased energy companies or other nonproducing entities Thus these restrictions do not

Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EdF owns of power generation and of distribution A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TWh hydro Other small IPPs sell their production to EdF under a regulated tariff There has been significan t development of cogeneration projects since There is now MW of installed capacity thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe r generated from cogeneration units at a preferable is preferable the correct word tariff In the view of the transposition of the EU Electricity Directive into French law this purchase obligation ceased to apply for new large projects over MW from st Jan More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession area Regulatory Environment The French Electricity law was passed on February implementing regulated third party access TPA in France under a transitional regime T he law was approved one year late failing to meet the required EU deadline Dozens Dozens I would replace this with Several of application decrees still have to be passed including tariffs to eligible industrials The French power market is open to competition however About eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier Current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per year and per site representing about eligible clients and sites The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive in Feb as the French government declined a quicker opening of the power market Eligibility of distribution companies is limited to the eligible consumptio n of customers located in their concession area A threeyear framework contract eg by way of a Master Agreement with a minimum term of three years is required for eligible customers but eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a three year contractual framework New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision from the Ministry of Industry which is the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t o eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Trading is currently defined as the conditio ns of power purchase for resale to eligible customers These Trading restrictions however do not apply to ECTRL as we are not registered in France IPPs are free to sell and export power The French System Operator RTE was created on July and is a subdivision of EdF although it is unbundled in terms of management and accounting A postage stamp tariff was implemented under the transitional regime which varies according to the voltage usedand which is based on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract transmission u p to the maximum capacity that they will use RTE purchases excess capacity available through transmission contracts at fixed prices which represents about half of the market price Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created programme responsible contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which allow the aggregation of imbalance charges for differen t eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Eligible customers who are physically connected to the Grid have to contract for transmission visvis RTE Contrat Made Traders such as ECTRL are not required to have such a transmission contract as they do no t consume the power they purchase Only a programme responsible contract coupled with grid access contracts import export andor transit are required by RTE A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer setting up new conditions for transmission transits and exports under a permanent regime It is likely that this new tariff will implement a injection delive ry calculation factor Imports which are allocated on a prorata basis are free of transmission charges Programme responsible contracts have established the basis of trading in France through the exchange of blocs from one perimeter to another Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is programme responsible in France Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule by RTE and congestion fees are levied at the margin whi ch favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player s In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R TE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports and imports This allocation rule is likely to change by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come The CRE Commission de Regulation de lElectricite is the offical regulato ry body which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues while IPP licenses and eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry Business Opportunity Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France the abilit y to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage between the flexibility of the industrial process market prices and optional structures The establishment of programme responsible contrac ts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France ECTRL closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was the very first new entrant to trade power buysell in Franc e late An intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports and is expected to soon be extended to exchange of blocs in France Liquidity has been dramatically increasing although the market remains dominated by the historical player thanks to RTE capacity auctions for auction has not been implemented on Spanish side yet QUERY do we need this bit in brackets What does it add Cant we just delete it Or i s it a note and someone has to write some better text here It just does no t read correctly in English owing to its place in the sentence at present UK Italy and Spain interconnectors RTE tenders for HV Grid losses industrial s switching and new players coming into the market In addition the Europea n Commission has determined that EdF will auction MW of virtual capacity through VPP and PPA auctions in September representing about of t he market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity A network code is currently under discussion between market players and RTE Future Development It is forecasted that both balancing market and spot exchange market will b e implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options which will be exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producerconsumer thus providing RTE with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services The Some of the spot market volume is expected to be run by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EdF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met ECTRL has actively been lobbying in order to have fa ir and transparent rules implemented for every player in the market and has actively contributed for a spot market to take place However thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly The Gas Market Situation A transitional regime was implemented on August by direct applicati on of the EU Directive thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose consumption is over million cubic meters pa The eligibility threshold will be reduced to million cubic meters in and million cubic mete rs in No gas law has been passed yet forecasted mid and its is expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end A zonaldistancerelated tariff was disclosed published on July by GdFTransportation A permanent entryexit tariff structure is likely to be developed for Charges for imbalances are expensive and access t o storage is restricted GdFTrading however has published conditions for balancing services There is only one trading Hub for France located at the FrenchBelgian bord er BlaregniesTaisniSres Due to the distancerelated nature of the transportation tariff competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a re located not too far less than about Km from the FrenchBelgian border The main imports into France are for high cal gas and GdF has published th e conditions for high callow cal gas swaps As there is not yet a new gas law in France a Projet de Loi was approved on th May transposing the EU Gas Directive into domestic legislation the Regulatory Commission has not been appointed todate and the official regulatory body remains the Ministry of Industry Although current conditions do not facilitate full requirement supply to customers from new entrants it is already possible to optimise gas supply through import of blocs for part or full supply ECTRL was the first new entrant to supply gas at the French border and more recently into France ECTRLs cumulative volume of gas trades so far totals million cubic meters

registration letter agr ee with Pierre who should act as principal contact Establish once and for all the role of Trustee and CRE in the process of approving capacity release phasing auction process for each phase and product specifications AND understand how the consultation process will work once we have the IM Hence need to discuss with MTF then Trustee and CRE asap ie in June if possible Preferably before we meet again with PWCRoth In addition to Pierres comments the PIM also states that strike prices at least are subject to Trustee review but a number of areas need to be questioned Capacity Release Phasing PIM confirms the year period of the remdey b ut also says a review can be requested after years Bruno you need to review the remedy doc but I do not see how a year phasing of capacity release complies with the remedy at least in spirit We would suggest there is no impediment to offering the FULL remedy in a single phase If theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to release unsold capacity on a monthly or annual basis through the year period The current proposal is no more than EdF trying to minimise capaci ty release andor extract max value cant blame them for trying but it is not what we want or what remedy requires EdFs only real argument is that phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblit y threshold drops in France However since eligible demand already exceeds total capacity release this would limit development of competition to existing eligibles As a minimum the release programme for all capacity should be clearly defined up front not at the whim of EdF Peter though ts on this and how in context of remedy we can argue for accelerated single phase auction with possible reauctioning of unsold capacity over years Auction Process qualifying criteria likely to be more defined in IM bu t no obvious problems here I am less sure about nature of auction process We obviously need to think it through more but why not just have a simple process based on single sealed bids or an electronic bid process The us e of price clock controlled by the auctioneer may allow a reserve price to be set which is clearly not the intent of the remedy this should be set at zero for all product groups not subjectively to ensure excess demand but only for certain groups Product Specs need to understand what if anything can be changed here Strikes seem to be subject to Trustee approval but we need to understand what else can be influenced eg within day flex Since we have already covered

auction a total of megawatts which include MW of peak capacity sold at a price of euros per megawatt hour MWh and MW of baseload at a price of eight eurosMWh In addition MW of cogeneration production capacity will be made available Production from cogeneration plants is bought by EdF from smalle r producers under longterm contracts With such contracts electricity suppliers and traders will be able to hav e electricity without the technical and operational risks of running a power plant said EdF in a statement The price for cogeneration capacity will be made public a few weeks before the auction as it depends on gas price movements EdF said The auction will take place in several tranches the first one starting in September when MW of peak capacity will be auctioned MW of baselo ad and MW of cogeneration The whole MW should be sold by October EdF which has a percent share of the French generation market has a total installed capacity of MW Original Message From Dindarova Nailia Sent May

September All agents of the electric sector will be invited to comment the terms of regulatory decree although such comments will be used for informational purposes and will not bind the Secretariat of Energy to make any changes whatsoever to its original document Although Decree No is effective as from today there are doubts in the industry as to whether it will be abolished in the future by Congress The reason for this uncertainty is that such Decree was issued within the framework of the Competitivity Law by which Congress delegated to the Executive Branch its powers to legislate specifically on changes required to transform the economy Although this Decree and the changes it fosters indirectly affect the economy since the law it amends is not purely economical it may be

government what we have been saying they want to change the deal In Furnas defense I need to add that they feel they have been handed a bad contract and they want regulatory relief which it has been granted on a casebycase basis in other deals So part of their strategy is to force MME or Aneel to provide some tariff relief I asked them to list out the key issues with the Consent Old a the days additional time Furnas b The guarantee substitution at the time of privatization c the lenders involvement on contract changes we do not want to go to Washington to negotiate Newer d giving up their right to ask Aneel to homologar ratify rather than registrar contract changes big risk for us I believe the have more direct issues We go back to Rio Monday another holiday down the drain and Tuesday

is giving into the database Completed the negotiations and FERC filing of the Next Hour Market scheduling proposal When implemented scheduled for June this will provide one stop shopping for next hour business Ties OASIS and TAGGING together into one request Also if a tranmission provider cuts the transmission the PSE only pays for his actual use versus what he originally scheduled This will speed up the ability to schedule the next hour nonfirm This order is an important recognition by FERC that its OATT did not cover hourly which we complained about alot at FERCs hotline last summer Successful in obtaining the release of all ISN system information to marketers in the WSCC region This was an individual effort by Dick that h as been benificial for our traders in the WEST Successfully prevented the WS CC Operating Committee from taking action that would have reversed this effort Assisted in getting the initial control areas in SERC approved last ye ar and preventing ATC changes this year and OC changes that would have negated the Control Area effort Dick served as Co CHAIR of the ISO committee that put the SPP contract in place that eliminated MW mile pricing in SPP and will serve as the basis for SPPs RTO Dick was appointed to the NERC Control Area Task Force which was formed as a result of our the success of the Enron Control Areas in TVA and have s o far been successful in keeping this effort so that it is non punitive Thi s has turned into a very positive process that may result in a new configuration of the NERC relibiability effort Dicks made comments to ENTERGY that helped push Entergy into filing their new scheduling procedure ultimate source and sink with FERC This was initially going to be implemented unilaterally March without a FERC filing and Enron would have been forced into an after the fact complaint situation at FERC where we are not allowed to get damages that we would hav e incurred in the meantime See Comm Masseys concurrence in Aquila v Enter gy about the lack of incentive to file complaints Kevin Presto said that winning the protest at FERC due would be worth MM On TECO revised its proposed generator imbalance charge from minute by minute to hourly accountability notably TECO revised its propos al before FERC issued an order based on the EPSA protest herein We worked wi th EPSA to file an EPSA protest to TECOs proposal We didnt like TECO s proposal but had commercial concerns about filing a protest in our own name since Enron is working with TECO on a project We were able to get EPSA to protest this issue in TECOs initial filing Enron is planning to site generation in Florida but we dont have the value on this win yet FERC issued a NOPR on January proposing to revise the way it assesses annual charges to public utilities Enron along with several other participants Dynegy Koch APX Citizens NP Energy Sonat a nd Williams filed a petition for rulemaking with FERC in August requesting FERC to revise its methodology for assessing annual charges arguing that FERCs current system of assessing annual charges on sales for resale of power discourages trading impedes reliance on competitive market s for power and could create competitive advantages for utilities over new power marketers entering the market We proposed that FERC either assess i ts costs on transmission only or reallocate the amounts that it collects through sales transactions versus transmission transactions Although FERC does not grant our petition and in fact dismisses it as moot the petition served its purpose In the NOPR FERC notes that because most of its time is spent on transmission issues a point that we made in the Petition it is appropria te to assess costs only on the MWh of electric energy transmitted in interstat e commerce by public utilities Under the current assessment system FERC divides its costs between transmission and sales Now FERC is proposing to collect its costs solely through transmission FERC justifies this change because it spends most of its time on transmission issues and because transmission providers can collect the fees through transmission charges assessed to users of the grid FERC proposes to asses its costs to unbundled wholesale transmission unbundled retail transmission and bundled wholesale power sales Bundled native load transactions will apparently avoid assessments of any FERCrelated costs however EPSA and Enron are protesting this issue at FERC Jim Steffes has been working on a calculation of additional value Interconnection Policy Utilizing EPSA efforts including Sarahs meeting with FERC we got the policy statement we urged FERC to put forth in the forum we suggested ie an existing proceeding in the Tennessee Powe r order where FERC said interconnection procedures should follow the pro form a tariff including that a generator doesnt have to request transmission and interconnection at the same time We worked with EPSA to draft the Model interconnection agreement that EPSA filed at FERC in the Entergy interconnection proposal AEPCSW order approved the merger but accepted intervenors testimony showing market power and conditioned merger on an independent calculation of ATC postings which we proposed and independent market monitor soon after the merger occurs with RTO participation by Kevin Presto said the independent ATC calculation is worth MM to Enron Note we are going to propose MAIN instead of SPP which AEP chose Kev in said that AEPs ATC calculation can trump all interfaces in ECAR so this h as a positive effect not just on AEP but on all of ECAR MAPP FERC further order on refunds MAPP refused to refund moni es that it was unable to collect from a nonjurisdictional member transmission owner NPPD EPMI filed a protest to MAPPs refund report arguing that MAPP was ordered to make full refunds and it violated that order FERC agreed with Enron and rejected MAPPs refund report FERC said MAPP must refun d the full amount to transmission customers whether or not it was able to collec t that money from NPPD Results in another of refunds for EPMI Sarah is working on the PGE sale

AM Steve Hopper AM To Ricky Lynn nron John nron Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Peter E nron Ray RANSREDES Doug RANSREDES cc Subject Dave Barrys thoughts on CAs electrical storage Feb PM The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite By DAVE BARRY When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California our reaction as concerned Americans is Ha ha No seriously we are alarmed Because history teaches us that whatever happens to California smog road rage tofu coffee that is mainly air cell phones the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive Shirley MacLaine people taking inline skating seriously grandmothers sporting new and flagrantly inappropriate bosoms eventually happens to the rest of the nation Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage and see if we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and change the subject Our first question is What exactly is electricity When we look in our Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia we see that electricity is defined as a class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge and from the interaction of charges What does this mean in laypersons terms It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big fat dope Because we know from our juniorhighschool science training that electricity is actually a fastmoving herd of electrons which are tiny onecelled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside a doubleA battery where they die within minutes Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited This was proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during a thunderstorm and was almost killed Encouraged by this success Franklin went on to conduct many more electrical experiments including rolling a hoop in a thunderstorm playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing somersaults in a thunderstorm Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm leaving the authorities with no choice but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France Nevertheless Franklin had proved an important scientific point which is that electricity originates inside clouds There it forms into lightning which is attracted to the earth by golfers After entering the ground the electricity hardens into coal which when dug up by power companies and burned in big ovens called generators turns back into electricity which is sent in the form of volts also known as watts or rpm for short through special wires with birds sitting on them to consumers homes where it is transformed by TV sets into commercials for beer which passes through the consumers and back into the ground thus completing what is known as a circuit But enough technical talk The problem is that California is running out of electricity The situation is so bad that in some hospitals they dont have enough electricity to power those electricshock paddles that get peoples hearts started again instead the doctors and nurses have to hold hands scuff their feet across the carpet in unison then shout CLEAR as they touch the patients chest Who is responsible for Californias electricity shortage You could blame the power companies or you could blame environmental wackos or you could blame the entertainment industry which uses more than billion watts of electricity per day just to blowdry the hair of the cast of Dawsons Creek or you could blame why not the Firestone tire company But you would be wrong Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity shortage is college students I base this statement on widespread observation of my son who is a college student and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium If my son is in a room then every electrical device within yards of that room every light computer television stereo video game microwave oven etc will be running My son doesnt even have to turn the devices on they activate themselves spontaneously in response to his presence Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in California which according to my research is EDITOR Please insert number of college students in California and you see my point which is EDITOR Please insert my point The question is What can the rest of us do to help our fellow countrypersons in California The answer is that we can send them our spare electricity Just imagine what would happen if all the households in this great and generous nation got out their extension cords and connected them together forming a giant electrical chain of helping across the fruited plain to the Golden State Millions of people would be turned into generous smoking lumps of carbon thats what So maybe we should go with Plan B This involves building a really really really big kite KnightRidder Tribune

DenneCorpEnron on PM From Ann M Schmidt PM To Karen NRON cc Subject Poll Articles NEWS Davis Puts His Spin on Energy Crisis He polls voters sends faxes defending charges of critics Patrick Hoge Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright While Gov Gray Davis is searching for answers to Californias energy crisis he also has been polling voters about potential solutions and trying to convince opinion leaders that he is taking decisive action Interviews with Davis pollster lawmakers and those on the receiving end of the publicity campaign offer a glimpse into the tight link between policy and politics as the governor negotiates a way out of the power crunch Recently as independent polls showed that in Californians believe the crisis is the states No problem Davis backed a bill that could lead to electricity rate increases after saying for months that he opposed them Last week the governors office sent a statement titled Meeting the Energy Challenge to nearly opinion leaders and decision makers touting Davis record and refuting the claims of critics that he has been too slow to act Fortuna Union High School District Superintendent Dennis Hanson whose Humboldt County office received one of the faxes was offended by what he saw as an attempt to manipulate him Making it political provides no solutions said an angry Hanson whose district is preparing for a utility bill that is potentially higher this school year The unwillingness of anybody to take responsibility boggles my mind Davis aides insist that the governor isnt preoccupied with the views of voters despite his political operation polling Californians on the energy issue since last summer Some critics suggest that Davis fear of a public backlash has exacerbated his usual cautiousness and contributed to the energy crisis Thats ridiculous said Davis pollster Paul Maslin We do a lot less polling than anybody understands For significant periods of this entire issue there has not been polling going on Its a far cry from the perception from recent White Houses where everything must be polled The surveys of Californians which are paid for by Davis political campaign help frame issues and determine factors such as the publics willingness to conserve Maslin said The responses are not used to guide intricate policy decisions he said At the same time however Maslin explained that his polling shows residents clearly dont want electricity service left to the vagaries of the free market they want some kind of government command of the system and theyre willing to trade some rate increases for greater certainty If you had to boil it down they want greater control here somehow Maslin said I think the governor and the Legislature would be well served to listen to that right now In fact recent proposals by the governor and the Legislature such as the states billion purchase of longterm power or a state takeover of the utility transmission system show they are addressing such concerns Political analysts say Davis polling reflects a pervasive reliance by politicians at all levels of government on public opinion a focus that is not helpful when confronting a highly technical matter like energy policy Indeed Davis is not alone Democratic Assembly leaders recently used their own poll numbers to convince colleagues to spend million in taxpayer money to buy electricity Polls are crude instruments that pose simplistic questions to people who are often uneducated about the issues said Professor Barbara OConnor director of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State University Sacramento I think its the absence of leadership when politicians base their behavior on what people think of them OConnor said The state GOP might agree The party bucked the desires of Republican legislative leaders and aired radio commercials last week criticizing Davis leadership on the crisis The ads began running yesterday in the Bay Area At least one Republican had asked the party to discontinue the ads So far Maslin said Californians are not blaming Davis for the power problems because they see it as caused by deregulation legislation passed in when Republican Gov Pete Wilson was in office The way they view the current governor and the Legislature is Fix it he said Were not blaming you because we understand it didnt happen on your watch but get us out of this mess As the states chief executive Davis has been criticized by industry executives analysts lawmakers and regulators for his wariness In contrast the statement Davis officials faxed last week to police and fire chiefs heads of school districts municipal officials and the like praised his bold decisive leadership Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio described the fax as a tool for public education Its just information Its not political at all Maviglio said This is part of a continuing effort the governors office has done to inform the community about the governors actions and policies It was first used during the education proposals last year Outraged utility executives meanwhile said the governors fax wrongly blamed them for not being more proactive Im appalled by reading such a statement said Harold Ray executive vice president of Southern California Edison Co Ray was particularly irked by a passage about longterm contracts between the states major utilities and power providers The governors fax claimed that since Davis appointed Loretta Lynch president of the states Public Utilities Commission last March the PUC has approved every request from the utilities for authority to sign longterm contracts in a timely fashion Ray claims that signing contracts directly with generators instead of through a staterun exchange could have saved his company about billion On Aug the commission ostensibly gave the utilities authority to sign such contracts but Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co executives say the regulators refused to approve contracts or to provide guidelines for them The commissions energy division is supervised by Lynch She told The Chronicle that the utilities should simply have acted without guidance from commission staff Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza chair of the Rules Committee said he believes that the PUC has contributed to energy market dysfunction in recent years Cardoza however praised Davis for now aggressively pursuing new generating plants in California and said any spin control will likely be irrelevant in the end because results will be what matters I dont think any amount of damage control is going to fix things if we dont get control of this said Cardoza If were able to solve the problem we get kudos If we dont we get dinged PHOTO Caption Gov

Press Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved NEWS Californians Cast a Cold Eye At Power Crisis Polls Find Shortages join education as top concern Katherine Seligman Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright Yes the energy crisis is serious but most Californians see it as a plot by power companies seeking to jack up utility bills according to the latest energy poll by the Field Institute The poll released today found Californians growing more dubious about the roots of the socalled crisis More than half of those surveyed percent said the shortage amounts to an attempt to raise rates rather than an emergency born purely from lack of generating sources or from increased demand Real or fabricated the public is overwhelmingly concerned about the crisis and is staying tuned to news of blackouts and energy grids both the Field Poll and one from the Public Policy Institute of California show almost everyone is following the news In fact the energy shortage has joined education as a top concern for Californians according to the Public Policy Institute poll also released today That poll reveals that almost percent of Californians say energy is a big problem and only about half of those polled think economic good times are ahead a drop from percent in August And state residents are mad at just about everyone for the energy situation and the looming shortages The public is in a pretty foul mood said Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll They blame just about everybody The public is pretty cynical about how we got to this situation When asked whos to blame for the situation about threequarters of those in the Field Poll pointed the finger at failure to build new power plants the states private utility companies and the state Public Utilities Commission More than percent blamed the federal Energy Regulatory Commission the state Legislature activist groups that blocked new plant construction and an increase in industrial energy use Gov Gray Davis however came out on top of the electrical heap with only percent blaming him for the current situation Fifty three percent blamed his predecessor Pete Wilson Most respondents said they take at least somewhat seriously the potential for utility company bankruptcy and with it the threat of blackouts When it comes to solving the problem most want the state government to step in and become a middleman buying electricity for the utility companies the Field Poll found Davis has argued that the state can get better prices because of its good credit rating The electricity would then be sold to the power companies In order to fix the problem most Californians percent think the state should go back to regulating the energy industry Only percent of those in the Field Poll said they think the crisis can be solved without reregulation In the Public Policy Institutes poll only percent advocated reregulation with percent favoring the construction of more power plants and percent leaning toward more conservation Although they are deeply concerned about the energy shortage most Californians responded in the Field Poll that they dont want air quality standards relaxed to produce more electricity Only percent thought that solution was satisfactory But when asked if air quality standards should be relaxed in some areas to get older plants functioning and to speed approval of new plants Californians were more divided Almost half percent approved of that strategy Fortysix percent opposed it The energy problems dont bode well for the state according to those surveyed by the Public Policy Institute Eightytwo percent said they thought the issue will damage the states economy in the next few years with more than half saying it will hurt the economy a great deal Californians are deeply worried about the implications of this crisis for the state economy and their own pocketbooks said the institutes survey director Mark Baldassare Right now they are still holding out hope but their optimism as well as the political fortunes of state leaders may suffer if they fail to see some action soon The private nonpartisan research institute conducted its survey

nron cc james d nron Subject Re CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Alan DayAhead HourAhead Markets Market separation rules aside we should resist any mandatory DayAhead Market The results for dayahead clearing markets have been bid gaming to influence price in the dayahead market In PJM and NYISO parties submit false load and generation schedules in set price most often this is a low ball load estimatethen later the true load is scheduled I think there is less of a problem with the hourahead market since the opportunity to submit a false bid to set price and then replace it later is very limited if not nonexistent Unbalance Schedules The general direction we are going for Eastern ISOs is to allow unbalance schedules in the realtime market Tim indicated a few weeks ago that he still wants this feature Normally there would be no imbalance penalties however when reserve margins are so slim that the systems security is in jeopardy penalties would be triggered The result is that parties can choose to use the realtime market or they can choose bilateral schedules or a combination They are not compelled to do either As long as reserves are adequate then why should we care Unit Commitment Although not on your list I think the primary problems that the DayAhead Market is trying to solve is unit commitment While this may be the intended purpose it hasnt worked very well Centralized unit commitment would address the problem but then the operator decisions have a large impact on prices without having any consequences We need a proposal for making sure that resources will be on line and that the operator knows they will be in place A possible approach may be as follows as suggested by Mike Roan The Operator publishes its expected realtime price for the next hours based on information supplied by generators regarding their availability and bid price one part and the ISOs estimate of hourly loads The estimates roll forward every hour to that a continuous two day outlook is provided to all market participants The Operator provides the demandsupply curves to the market so everyone has the same information As units are committed and load forecast is adjusted the estimate of realtime prices changes providing signals for units to use in deciding to commit units As expected price rises more units are committed and price goes down At a given point in time such as hours ahead of realtime the Operator locks units in as committed If there are inadequate units committed it pays to add capacity call contracts If not enough is voluntarily bid the Operator orders units on under emergency rules contained in interconnectionintegration agreements with the generators The cost of the call contracts or of units ordered on is included in the cost of imbalance energy in realtime for the hours for which those costs were incurred This procedure is a continuous bid type of approach which provides signals and information to the market It or some other procedure like it is needed to address the Operators concerns that it will be able to operate the system and to deal with the overly conservative tendencies of a notforprofit ISO Steve Alan Comnes PM To james d nron cc Subject CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Here are some initial reactions and questions to the CAISO market stabilization plan which is attached Give me or Sue Mara your comments and then we can turn it into message points for media advocacy folks In addition to reviewing the plan I listened in to part of a stakeholder call that occured Friday am PST DRAFT MESSAGE POINTS With limited exceptions the plan does nothing to increase supply or decrease demand It primarily addresses costs and market stability INTERESTING QUOTES Over the edge into cost based regulation Duke Power Although the plan provides for cost control and for improving market stability whatever that means the ISO staffer Byron Wortz who presented the study admitted it Will do nothing to increase supply this summer A staffer Lorenzo stated paraphrased all out of state suppliers are cost of service based and do not need to recieve market based rates ON SPECIFICS The Ugly Resourcespecific cost based bid caps RSBC or bid caps cost of service regulation that disincent supply The ISO will hold instate resources hostagecuts any exports when reserves fall below a stated critera Imports can only participate as price takers Thus if the highestcost instate resource is below the opportunity cost of power needed imports will not come in this will decrease supply Staffer stated ISO hopes to sign longer term deals if necessary to secure outofstate power but acknowledged the proposal needs more work The Bad The ISO is considering pay as bid which is complex and does not increase supply However on the call they said they are leaing to a single price auction However with bid caps the market will still be distorted The Good The ISO wll implement an hourly dayahead and hourahead market essentially filling a void created by the PXs demise Enron has strongly advocated market seperation in the past but do we want to consider supporting a day ahead market Market separation rules MSR ISO is leaning towards option in which SCs submit bundled schedules but that market seperation would be suspended after congestion process is conducted ie final schedules may be imbalanced What do we think of this

great time this is to b e at Enron I believe that more strongly than ever given the new markets we are entering the enhanced focus of the company on markets and regions arou nd the world that best fit with our core competencies and the phenomenal grow th of the company perhaps best evidenced by the earnings report of the first quarter But there are challenges as well California and its regional a nd global implications and the general market conditions that have brought ou r stock price well off its recent highs With respect to each of these and other challenges there are invariably opportunities for example the enhanced opportunity for the FERC to finish the job of opening wholesale electricity markets in the context of California and in the context of a lower stock price a recognition that accelerated growth in earnings will bring the stock price to new highs in the not too distant future One way that earnings can grow beyond Wall Street expectations is by bringing a bit more discipline to how all of us spend money at Enron We in Government Affairs can point to many efforts and processes that have been designed to instill that spending and resource allocation discipline in the last few years We have always done our part but there is always more that can be done To increase earnings and correspondingly the stock price I recently met with various Government Affairs group heads to discuss ways Government Affairs can do things better and more cost effectively We looked at group travel costs outside services and other budget items Attached for your review and use is a copy of a new Travel Policy and new Cell Phone Policy which I believe will ensure consistency across the group and deliver cost savings Such travel policies already exist in various regions such as Enr on Europe Regional Business Unit travel policies will continue to be applied where applicable Further as a result of our review of the budget we have identified saving s across the North American group in excess of million dollars USD Th is is in addition to almost million dollars USD by which the Enron Europe Government Affairs budget has been reduced as well as significant reductio ns that have occurred in the South American group Finally I have also decide d to create a global government affairs hiring committee which will evaluate the need for any proposed hires new and existing positions The purpose of the committee will be to assess whether the need is valid and assuming it is determine the most effective way to fill the position By encompassing a crosssection of the Government Affairs group globally it is my hope that we will arrive at better hiring decisions The hiring committee will consist of Aleck Dadson Toronto Sue Nord Houston Jim Steffes Houston Paul Dawson London Doug Wood London Nick ODay Tokyo Sergio Assad S ao Paulo Linda Robertson Washington and myself The committee will meet on an as needed basis I believe that these changes will allow us all the opportunity to provide more cost effective and efficient service to the business units we support I encourage each of you to review the new policies and provide feedback Thank you

should feel quite proud of this achievment Thanks Linda Robertson PM To Ray NRON cc Harry NRON James D NRON Richard NRON Robert NeustaedterENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Steven J NRON Subject Re Tariffs Approved Excellent and congratulations Ray Alvarez PM To Steven J nron Richard nron Linda NRON James D nron cc Harry nron Robert NeustaedterENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Tariffs Approved The rate case that the governmental affairs group filed in January on behalf of Transredes has come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates will go into effect towards the end of this month The rates are not much lower than what we filed for and represent a very significant increase over the previous rates The tariff methodology and revised regulations put into effect by the Supreme Decree were followed to the letter by the regulator despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down The deliverables here were to obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would make the company financeable rescue it from dire financial straits and file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the tariff methodology This second deliverable has now been completed Transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the uncertainty about rates it is my understanding that the financial market loved the ruling and that Transredes sold million worth of bonds in about minutes This ruling should also significantly increase Transredess market value relative to Enrons efforts to sell its interest in the company Forwarded by Ray AlvarezNAEnron on AM Doug Farmer PM To Peter E WeidlerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Jan van den RANSREDES John RANSREDES Cyro RANSREDES Pedro RANSREDES Fernando RANSREDES Subject Tariffs Approved Gentlemen I am delighted to report that SIRESE approved substantial increases in TRs tariffs consistent with the Law and Regulation The details are Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved Increase TRCLHB Proposed TRCLHB Increase Gas Export including surcharges excluding RG Liquids Domestic Liquids Export CLHBs tariffs were also approved as follows As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB comparable with our liquids domestic We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach their conclusions on Monday but our inteligence suggests the following Export gas volumes increased to TR capacity and GSA Cuiaba assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes RG Compresion project deleted Interest rate reduced to or ie the rate in our bond issue Liquids expansion in the South reduced Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between concesions OCC in service date slipped from to DebtEquity assumption changed from to Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows Volumes Covered by rule we can blete but can expect little back here Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the short term ie RG Compression not worth fighting for since we dont even have the support of BG Interest Rate Well get this back when we do a tariff revision and actual rates are used When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we have concrete grounds ie commision costs etc are omited Liquids Expansion in the South Here we intend to do a detailed analysis of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquidsgas production will be shut in If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected producers PB BG Vintage and Chaco We will then write to those producerscopy SIRESE VMEH etc stating that on their recommendation the project scope was reduced by SIRESE We will give them an estimate of the lost liquidsgas production in both volume and cash terms resultant from this decision We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal Continuity of Service Capex We need to see the detail here We will take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared to compromise our safety and environmental standards We need to see exactly what has been removed but my thought is that if that means we are unable to provide some services eg LPG transportation or the continued operation of some liquids laterals we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the decision Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the SIRESE budget process OPEX need to see the detail on Monday OCC will not appeal we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC strategy DebtEquity ratio Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance with the LawRegulation the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is However we have very strong grounds to appeal since a we are currently miles away from let alone b we can only borrow for CAPEX as per bond issue and the policy of allmost bankslending institutions with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from We intend to fight this one very hard using all the externalindependant help we can get As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut This has not happened SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases Having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much smaller and hence managable increases Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume assumptions ie the worst case Regards Doug

D Walton Steve Palmer Mark A PR Comnes Alan Badeer Robert Williams III Bill Mallory Chris Denne Karen Belden Tim Yoder Christian Sanders Richard B Subject As the CAISO Turns CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWRs longterm contracts Everyone This is hot news showing that the CAISOCDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought I am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and FERCs attention According to two sources the CAISO is helping to bail Gov Davis out of his highpriced CDWR longterm power contracts by purchasing CDWRs excess energy as an Out Of Market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the CAISOs Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff The costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISOs surreptitious transactions This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy RealTime auction first CAISO Tariff Dispatch Protocol section d Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy bids can the CAISO buy Out Of Market OOM energy If the CAISO were following the Tariff CDWRs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energywhich is often as low as Therefore under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as Therefore the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it While there is no evidence that Gov Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first this behavior clearly benefits Davis Absent the CAISOs purchases of CDWRs excess energy CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers The media has been been making hay out of Daviss strategy of buying high and selling low Therefore Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts Of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the CAISO The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who frequently seeing minute Ex Post prices of expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to These SCs are in for a big surprise According to one source at Sierra Pacific the CAISO charged him as much as MWh for imbalance energy Where is the price mitigation here Who benefits under this scam Davis and CDWR Who loses under this scam Instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy Sources Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and the Friday Burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito There is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market OOM calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post BEEP market As one of our faithful observers told me The ISO will be billing some DRWCERS longterm contracts to SCs as OOM energy This has been confirmed by the ISO This means there is no realtime price transparency We may see an hourly expost price of say but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual RealTime settlement price There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesnt post that information The implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait days before theyhave any idea of the price This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERCs goals of creating open transparent markets Here is the

Mgmt Subject Revelation Steve Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds mwh is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO His response was this that the CAISO is charging regardless of the INC and DEC prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS In effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS Kit

DenneCorpEnron on PM From Ann M Schmidt PM To Karen NRON cc Subject Poll Articles NEWS Davis Puts His Spin on Energy Crisis He polls voters sends faxes defending charges of critics Patrick Hoge Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright While Gov Gray Davis is searching for answers to Californias energy crisis he also has been polling voters about potential solutions and trying to convince opinion leaders that he is taking decisive action Interviews with Davis pollster lawmakers and those on the receiving end of the publicity campaign offer a glimpse into the tight link between policy and politics as the governor negotiates a way out of the power crunch Recently as independent polls showed that in Californians believe the crisis is the states No problem Davis backed a bill that could lead to electricity rate increases after saying for months that he opposed them Last week the governors office sent a statement titled Meeting the Energy Challenge to nearly opinion leaders and decision makers touting Davis record and refuting the claims of critics that he has been too slow to act Fortuna Union High School District Superintendent Dennis Hanson whose Humboldt County office received one of the faxes was offended by what he saw as an attempt to manipulate him Making it political provides no solutions said an angry Hanson whose district is preparing for a utility bill that is potentially higher this school year The unwillingness of anybody to take responsibility boggles my mind Davis aides insist that the governor isnt preoccupied with the views of voters despite his political operation polling Californians on the energy issue since last summer Some critics suggest that Davis fear of a public backlash has exacerbated his usual cautiousness and contributed to the energy crisis Thats ridiculous said Davis pollster Paul Maslin We do a lot less polling than anybody understands For significant periods of this entire issue there has not been polling going on Its a far cry from the perception from recent White Houses where everything must be polled The surveys of Californians which are paid for by Davis political campaign help frame issues and determine factors such as the publics willingness to conserve Maslin said The responses are not used to guide intricate policy decisions he said At the same time however Maslin explained that his polling shows residents clearly dont want electricity service left to the vagaries of the free market they want some kind of government command of the system and theyre willing to trade some rate increases for greater certainty If you had to boil it down they want greater control here somehow Maslin said I think the governor and the Legislature would be well served to listen to that right now In fact recent proposals by the governor and the Legislature such as the states billion purchase of longterm power or a state takeover of the utility transmission system show they are addressing such concerns Political analysts say Davis polling reflects a pervasive reliance by politicians at all levels of government on public opinion a focus that is not helpful when confronting a highly technical matter like energy policy Indeed Davis is not alone Democratic Assembly leaders recently used their own poll numbers to convince colleagues to spend million in taxpayer money to buy electricity Polls are crude instruments that pose simplistic questions to people who are often uneducated about the issues said Professor Barbara OConnor director of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State University Sacramento I think its the absence of leadership when politicians base their behavior on what people think of them OConnor said The state GOP might agree The party bucked the desires of Republican legislative leaders and aired radio commercials last week criticizing Davis leadership on the crisis The ads began running yesterday in the Bay Area At least one Republican had asked the party to discontinue the ads So far Maslin said Californians are not blaming Davis for the power problems because they see it as caused by deregulation legislation passed in when Republican Gov Pete Wilson was in office The way they view the current governor and the Legislature is Fix it he said Were not blaming you because we understand it didnt happen on your watch but get us out of this mess As the states chief executive Davis has been criticized by industry executives analysts lawmakers and regulators for his wariness In contrast the statement Davis officials faxed last week to police and fire chiefs heads of school districts municipal officials and the like praised his bold decisive leadership Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio described the fax as a tool for public education Its just information Its not political at all Maviglio said This is part of a continuing effort the governors office has done to inform the community about the governors actions and policies It was first used during the education proposals last year Outraged utility executives meanwhile said the governors fax wrongly blamed them for not being more proactive Im appalled by reading such a statement said Harold Ray executive vice president of Southern California Edison Co Ray was particularly irked by a passage about longterm contracts between the states major utilities and power providers The governors fax claimed that since Davis appointed Loretta Lynch president of the states Public Utilities Commission last March the PUC has approved every request from the utilities for authority to sign longterm contracts in a timely fashion Ray claims that signing contracts directly with generators instead of through a staterun exchange could have saved his company about billion On Aug the commission ostensibly gave the utilities authority to sign such contracts but Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co executives say the regulators refused to approve contracts or to provide guidelines for them The commissions energy division is supervised by Lynch She told The Chronicle that the utilities should simply have acted without guidance from commission staff Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza chair of the Rules Committee said he believes that the PUC has contributed to energy market dysfunction in recent years Cardoza however praised Davis for now aggressively pursuing new generating plants in California and said any spin control will likely be irrelevant in the end because results will be what matters I dont think any amount of damage control is going to fix things if we dont get control of this said Cardoza If were able to solve the problem we get kudos If we dont we get dinged PHOTO Caption Gov

Press Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved NEWS Californians Cast a Cold Eye At Power Crisis Polls Find Shortages join education as top concern Katherine Seligman Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright Yes the energy crisis is serious but most Californians see it as a plot by power companies seeking to jack up utility bills according to the latest energy poll by the Field Institute The poll released today found Californians growing more dubious about the roots of the socalled crisis More than half of those surveyed percent said the shortage amounts to an attempt to raise rates rather than an emergency born purely from lack of generating sources or from increased demand Real or fabricated the public is overwhelmingly concerned about the crisis and is staying tuned to news of blackouts and energy grids both the Field Poll and one from the Public Policy Institute of California show almost everyone is following the news In fact the energy shortage has joined education as a top concern for Californians according to the Public Policy Institute poll also released today That poll reveals that almost percent of Californians say energy is a big problem and only about half of those polled think economic good times are ahead a drop from percent in August And state residents are mad at just about everyone for the energy situation and the looming shortages The public is in a pretty foul mood said Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll They blame just about everybody The public is pretty cynical about how we got to this situation When asked whos to blame for the situation about threequarters of those in the Field Poll pointed the finger at failure to build new power plants the states private utility companies and the state Public Utilities Commission More than percent blamed the federal Energy Regulatory Commission the state Legislature activist groups that blocked new plant construction and an increase in industrial energy use Gov Gray Davis however came out on top of the electrical heap with only percent blaming him for the current situation Fifty three percent blamed his predecessor Pete Wilson Most respondents said they take at least somewhat seriously the potential for utility company bankruptcy and with it the threat of blackouts When it comes to solving the problem most want the state government to step in and become a middleman buying electricity for the utility companies the Field Poll found Davis has argued that the state can get better prices because of its good credit rating The electricity would then be sold to the power companies In order to fix the problem most Californians percent think the state should go back to regulating the energy industry Only percent of those in the Field Poll said they think the crisis can be solved without reregulation In the Public Policy Institutes poll only percent advocated reregulation with percent favoring the construction of more power plants and percent leaning toward more conservation Although they are deeply concerned about the energy shortage most Californians responded in the Field Poll that they dont want air quality standards relaxed to produce more electricity Only percent thought that solution was satisfactory But when asked if air quality standards should be relaxed in some areas to get older plants functioning and to speed approval of new plants Californians were more divided Almost half percent approved of that strategy Fortysix percent opposed it The energy problems dont bode well for the state according to those surveyed by the Public Policy Institute Eightytwo percent said they thought the issue will damage the states economy in the next few years with more than half saying it will hurt the economy a great deal Californians are deeply worried about the implications of this crisis for the state economy and their own pocketbooks said the institutes survey director Mark Baldassare Right now they are still holding out hope but their optimism as well as the political fortunes of state leaders may suffer if they fail to see some action soon The private nonpartisan research institute conducted its survey

Gus nron Angela nron Sharonda StephensCorpEnron Eric NRON Amber CT Merle CT Kerryann CT Makiko nron Subject Budget UpdateHiring Committee Formation In a recent organizational memo I mentioned what a great time this is to b e at Enron I believe that more strongly than ever given the new markets we are entering the enhanced focus of the company on markets and regions arou nd the world that best fit with our core competencies and the phenomenal grow th of the company perhaps best evidenced by the earnings report of the first quarter But there are challenges as well California and its regional a nd global implications and the general market conditions that have brought ou r stock price well off its recent highs With respect to each of these and other challenges there are invariably opportunities for example the enhanced opportunity for the FERC to finish the job of opening wholesale electricity markets in the context of California and in the context of a lower stock price a recognition that accelerated growth in earnings will bring the stock price to new highs in the not too distant future One way that earnings can grow beyond Wall Street expectations is by bringing a bit more discipline to how all of us spend money at Enron We in Government Affairs can point to many efforts and processes that have been designed to instill that spending and resource allocation discipline in the last few years We have always done our part but there is always more that can be done To increase earnings and correspondingly the stock price I recently met with various Government Affairs group heads to discuss ways Government Affairs can do things better and more cost effectively We looked at group travel costs outside services and other budget items Attached for your review and use is a copy of a new Travel Policy and new Cell Phone Policy which I believe will ensure consistency across the group and deliver cost savings Such travel policies already exist in various regions such as Enr on Europe Regional Business Unit travel policies will continue to be applied where applicable Further as a result of our review of the budget we have identified saving s across the North American group in excess of million dollars USD Th is is in addition to almost million dollars USD by which the Enron Europe Government Affairs budget has been reduced as well as significant reductio ns that have occurred in the South American group Finally I have also decide d to create a global government affairs hiring committee which will evaluate the need for any proposed hires new and existing positions The purpose of the committee will be to assess whether the need is valid and assuming it is determine the most effective way to fill the position By encompassing a crosssection of the Government Affairs group globally it is my hope that we will arrive at better hiring decisions The hiring committee will consist of Aleck Dadson Toronto Sue Nord Houston Jim Steffes Houston Paul Dawson London Doug Wood London Nick ODay Tokyo Sergio Assad S ao Paulo Linda Robertson Washington and myself The committee will meet on an as needed basis I believe that these changes will allow us all the opportunity to provide more cost effective and efficient service to the business units we support I encourage each of you to review the new policies and provide feedback Thank you

ToYeung Charles Cc Steffes James D Inger soll Richard SubjectRe Stakeholder Committee Notes To add to Charles memo The Trustees were all present to listen the debate at the stakeholders c ommittee That was very positive The agenda order was changed to allow ample time to discuss the issues Time and time again it was stated that NERC was running out of time to m ake the required transition If not alternatives would be pursued example EISB Time and time it was stated that the Goulding task force Recommendations should be taken as a package as a necessary first step These include Committee Representation The Task Force recommends that the NERC Board direct the standing committees to modify the standing committees represent ation and voting to reflect the Task Forces attached Initial Sectors and Criteria Model This Model is based on the Task Forces preference for rep resentation by sector and incorporates the Task Forces general recognit ion that an RTO sector should be included The Task Force recognizes that s ome work remains to be done to refine the definitions of each sector and th e criteria for belonging but believes that the Initial Sectors and Criteri a Model is an appropriate next step and should be taken immediately Assumi ng that it may take some months to put in place the details of the new Mode l including the new weighted voting procedures the Task Force recommends that two ISORTO representatives be added immediately to each of the existi ng standing committees to provide formal representation and a voting role f or ISOsRTOs until the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model has been implemen ted Committee Participation and Voting The Task Force recommends open part icipation in each sector subject to certain criteria and qualifications T he Task Force has evaluated the qualification criteria and voting procedure s used in several Regions ERCOT and MAAC and has incorporated features o f those procedures into the recommended participation and voting procedures Specifically the Task Force recommends weighted voting by and within eac h sector similar to what is done in MAAC Due Process The new Organization Standards Process which will be pres ented to the Board in October addresses most due process issues and concer ns The Task Force recommends implementing this new process immediately OneStop Shop The Task Force favors having a single organization for d eveloping Reliability Standards Market Interface Practices and Commercial Practices The Task Force believes that NERC has an opportunity to reinven t itself to become this organization and should take definitive steps in t hat direction at its October Board and Stakeholders Committee meetings Funding The Task Force recommends that steps be taken immediately to d ecouple the funding of NERC from the Regional Reliability Councils The Fun ding Task Group recommendations adopted by the Board in February sho uld be pursued MIC Role in Standards Approval The Task Force recommends as an immedi ate step to address concerns with the current NERC Standards Approval Proce ss and to provide a bridge until the new Organization Standards process is implemented requiring the MIC to vote on all newproposed NERC Operatin g Policies and Planning Standards and report results to the Board includin g consideration of any minority positions Lots of discussion about EISB and how

transpired at the NERC meeting in Vanco uver this Monday The customers met for almost hours before the start of the SHC meeting Reps from Enron Mirant Dynegy DENA APPA and ELCON were present All agreed that a unified voice is needed to show strong direction from the customer side This may mean putting aside some internal positions Cust omers need to show support of the Goulding Task Force recommendations which offers a package deal to move NERC forward as a single standards setting o rganization for both reliability and commercial issues The Goulding Task F orce recommendations do fall short of asking for NERC action Agenda Item Scope of NERC over Commercial Issues To ensure unity in appearance customers agreed to maintain discussions in front of the Independents at a higher policy level Many details are need ed to get individual entities on board however such details should not i mpede on the ability for customers to show strong support on principles i eonestopshop balance of

NERC does not have the authourity to require corporate independence Suggestions made to perform better and more audits Dave Penn brought up the memo fro m Roy Thilly Need to ask the Board to bring this issue to FERC for resolu tion Good arguments made by customers on need for independence in a new c ompetitive market structure FRCC Wiley made arguments that the NERC sho uld not revamp policies to police the few bad apples Should deal directly and specifically with the problem A straw poll was taken of the persons in the room over recommending actions NERC should require corporate indepdence and ask FERC to address it NERC should focus in on the problem Security Coordinators and take speci fic actions to safeguard independent judgement audits The vote was There were strong comments that this vote was not inte nded to be an industry representative vote only to show how split the indu stry is over this issue The meeting adjourned for lunch and the Independents left after the meeting reconvened The SHC agreed to ask the BOT the following Establish a goalvision to become the one stop shop for development of wholesale electric industry standards Add words that we need to go forward from where we are Take immediate action to adopt the initial recommendations contained in new Board agenda item Actively solicit cooperation collaboration and support from Canadian an d US government

AM Steve Hopper AM To Ricky Lynn nron John nron Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Peter E nron Ray RANSREDES Doug RANSREDES cc Subject Dave Barrys thoughts on CAs electrical storage Feb PM The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite By DAVE BARRY When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California our reaction as concerned Americans is Ha ha No seriously we are alarmed Because history teaches us that whatever happens to California smog road rage tofu coffee that is mainly air cell phones the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive Shirley MacLaine people taking inline skating seriously grandmothers sporting new and flagrantly inappropriate bosoms eventually happens to the rest of the nation Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage and see if we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and change the subject Our first question is What exactly is electricity When we look in our Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia we see that electricity is defined as a class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge and from the interaction of charges What does this mean in laypersons terms It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big fat dope Because we know from our juniorhighschool science training that electricity is actually a fastmoving herd of electrons which are tiny onecelled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside a doubleA battery where they die within minutes Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited This was proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during a thunderstorm and was almost killed Encouraged by this success Franklin went on to conduct many more electrical experiments including rolling a hoop in a thunderstorm playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing somersaults in a thunderstorm Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm leaving the authorities with no choice but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France Nevertheless Franklin had proved an important scientific point which is that electricity originates inside clouds There it forms into lightning which is attracted to the earth by golfers After entering the ground the electricity hardens into coal which when dug up by power companies and burned in big ovens called generators turns back into electricity which is sent in the form of volts also known as watts or rpm for short through special wires with birds sitting on them to consumers homes where it is transformed by TV sets into commercials for beer which passes through the consumers and back into the ground thus completing what is known as a circuit But enough technical talk The problem is that California is running out of electricity The situation is so bad that in some hospitals they dont have enough electricity to power those electricshock paddles that get peoples hearts started again instead the doctors and nurses have to hold hands scuff their feet across the carpet in unison then shout CLEAR as they touch the patients chest Who is responsible for Californias electricity shortage You could blame the power companies or you could blame environmental wackos or you could blame the entertainment industry which uses more than billion watts of electricity per day just to blowdry the hair of the cast of Dawsons Creek or you could blame why not the Firestone tire company But you would be wrong Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity shortage is college students I base this statement on widespread observation of my son who is a college student and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium If my son is in a room then every electrical device within yards of that room every light computer television stereo video game microwave oven etc will be running My son doesnt even have to turn the devices on they activate themselves spontaneously in response to his presence Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in California which according to my research is EDITOR Please insert number of college students in California and you see my point which is EDITOR Please insert my point The question is What can the rest of us do to help our fellow countrypersons in California The answer is that we can send them our spare electricity Just imagine what would happen if all the households in this great and generous nation got out their extension cords and connected them together forming a giant electrical chain of helping across the fruited plain to the Golden State Millions of people would be turned into generous smoking lumps of carbon thats what So maybe we should go with Plan B This involves building a really really really big kite KnightRidder Tribune

PM From Ann M Schmidt PM To Karen NRON cc Subject Poll Articles NEWS Davis Puts His Spin on Energy Crisis He polls voters sends faxes defending charges of critics Patrick Hoge Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright While Gov Gray Davis is searching for answers to Californias energy crisis he also has been polling voters about potential solutions and trying to convince opinion leaders that he is taking decisive action Interviews with Davis pollster lawmakers and those on the receiving end of the publicity campaign offer a glimpse into the tight link between policy and politics as the governor negotiates a way out of the power crunch Recently as independent polls showed that in Californians believe the crisis is the states No problem Davis backed a bill that could lead to electricity rate increases after saying for months that he opposed them Last week the governors office sent a statement titled Meeting the Energy Challenge to nearly opinion leaders and decision makers touting Davis record and refuting the claims of critics that he has been too slow to act Fortuna Union High School District Superintendent Dennis Hanson whose Humboldt County office received one of the faxes was offended by what he saw as an attempt to manipulate him Making it political provides no solutions said an angry Hanson whose district is preparing for a utility bill that is potentially higher this school year The unwillingness of anybody to take responsibility boggles my mind Davis aides insist that the governor isnt preoccupied with the views of voters despite his political operation polling Californians on the energy issue since last summer Some critics suggest that Davis fear of a public backlash has exacerbated his usual cautiousness and contributed to the energy crisis Thats ridiculous said Davis pollster Paul Maslin We do a lot less polling than anybody understands For significant periods of this entire issue there has not been polling going on Its a far cry from the perception from recent White Houses where everything must be polled The surveys of Californians which are paid for by Davis political campaign help frame issues and determine factors such as the publics willingness to conserve Maslin said The responses are not used to guide intricate policy decisions he said At the same time however Maslin explained that his polling shows residents clearly dont want electricity service left to the vagaries of the free market they want some kind of government command of the system and theyre willing to trade some rate increases for greater certainty If you had to boil it down they want greater control here somehow Maslin said I think the governor and the Legislature would be well served to listen to that right now In fact recent proposals by the governor and the Legislature such as the states billion purchase of longterm power or a state takeover of the utility transmission system show they are addressing such concerns Political analysts say Davis polling reflects a pervasive reliance by politicians at all levels of government on public opinion a focus that is not helpful when confronting a highly technical matter like energy policy Indeed Davis is not alone Democratic Assembly leaders recently used their own poll numbers to convince colleagues to spend million in taxpayer money to buy electricity Polls are crude instruments that pose simplistic questions to people who are often uneducated about the issues said Professor Barbara OConnor director of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State University Sacramento I think its the absence of leadership when politicians base their behavior on what people think of them OConnor said The state GOP might agree The party bucked the desires of Republican legislative leaders and aired radio commercials last week criticizing Davis leadership on the crisis The ads began running yesterday in the Bay Area At least one Republican had asked the party to discontinue the ads So far Maslin said Californians are not blaming Davis for the power problems because they see it as caused by deregulation legislation passed in when Republican Gov Pete Wilson was in office The way they view the current governor and the Legislature is Fix it he said Were not blaming you because we understand it didnt happen on your watch but get us out of this mess As the states chief executive Davis has been criticized by industry executives analysts lawmakers and regulators for his wariness In contrast the statement Davis officials faxed last week to police and fire chiefs heads of school districts municipal officials and the like praised his bold decisive leadership Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio described the fax as a tool for public education Its just information Its not political at all Maviglio said This is part of a continuing effort the governors office has done to inform the community about the governors actions and policies It was first used during the education proposals last year Outraged utility executives meanwhile said the governors fax wrongly blamed them for not being more proactive Im appalled by reading such a statement said Harold Ray executive vice president of Southern California Edison Co Ray was particularly irked by a passage about longterm contracts between the states major utilities and power providers The governors fax claimed that since Davis appointed Loretta Lynch president of the states Public Utilities Commission last March the PUC has approved every request from the utilities for authority to sign longterm contracts in a timely fashion Ray claims that signing contracts directly with generators instead of through a staterun exchange could have saved his company about billion On Aug the commission ostensibly gave the utilities authority to sign such contracts but Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co executives say the regulators refused to approve contracts or to provide guidelines for them The commissions energy division is supervised by Lynch She told The Chronicle that the utilities should simply have acted without guidance from commission staff Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza chair of the Rules Committee said he believes that the PUC has contributed to energy market dysfunction in recent years Cardoza however praised Davis for now aggressively pursuing new generating plants in California and said any spin control will likely be irrelevant in the end because results will be what matters I dont think any amount of damage control is going to fix things if we dont get control of this said Cardoza If were able to solve the problem we get kudos If we dont we get dinged PHOTO Caption Gov Gray Davis unveiled legislation to increase the states

NEWS Californians Cast a Cold Eye At Power Crisis Polls Find Shortages join education as top concern Katherine Seligman Chronicle Staff Writer The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A Copyright Yes the energy crisis is serious but most Californians see it as a plot by power companies seeking to jack up utility bills according to the latest energy poll by the Field Institute The poll released today found Californians growing more dubious about the roots of the socalled crisis More than half of those surveyed percent said the shortage amounts to an attempt to raise rates rather than an emergency born purely from lack of generating sources or from increased demand Real or fabricated the public is overwhelmingly concerned about the crisis and is staying tuned to news of blackouts and energy grids both the Field Poll and one from the Public Policy Institute of California show almost everyone is following the news In fact the energy shortage has joined education as a top concern for Californians according to the Public Policy Institute poll also released today That poll reveals that almost percent of Californians say energy is a big problem and only about half of those polled think economic good times are ahead a drop from percent in August And state residents are mad at just about everyone for the energy situation and the looming shortages The public is in a pretty foul mood said Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll They blame just about everybody The public is pretty cynical about how we got to this situation When asked whos to blame for the situation about threequarters of those in the Field Poll pointed the finger at failure to build new power plants the states private utility companies and the state Public Utilities Commission More than percent blamed the federal Energy Regulatory Commission the state Legislature activist groups that blocked new plant construction and an increase in industrial energy use Gov Gray Davis however came out on top of the electrical heap with only percent blaming him for the current situation Fifty three percent blamed his predecessor Pete Wilson Most respondents said they take at least somewhat seriously the potential for utility company bankruptcy and with it the threat of blackouts When it comes to solving the problem most want the state government to step in and become a middleman buying electricity for the utility companies the Field Poll found Davis has argued that the state can get better prices because of its good credit rating The electricity would then be sold to the power companies In order to fix the problem most Californians percent think the state should go back to regulating the energy industry Only percent of those in the Field Poll said they think the crisis can be solved without reregulation In the Public Policy Institutes poll only percent advocated reregulation with percent favoring the construction of more power plants and percent leaning toward more conservation Although they are deeply concerned about the energy shortage most Californians responded in the Field Poll that they dont want air quality standards relaxed to produce more electricity Only percent thought that solution was satisfactory But when asked if air quality standards should be relaxed in some areas to get older plants functioning and to speed approval of new plants Californians were more divided Almost half percent approved of that strategy Fortysix percent opposed it The energy problems dont bode well for the state according to those surveyed by the Public Policy Institute Eightytwo percent said they thought the issue will damage the states economy in the next few years with more than half saying it will hurt the economy a great deal Californians are deeply worried about the implications of this crisis for the state economy and their own pocketbooks said the institutes survey director Mark Baldassare Right now they are still holding out hope but their optimism as well as the political fortunes of state leaders may suffer if they fail to see some action soon The private nonpartisan research institute conducted its survey Jan by phoning residents The Field

nron cc james d nron Subject Re CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Alan DayAhead HourAhead Markets Market separation rules aside we should resist any mandatory DayAhead Market The results for dayahead clearing markets have been bid gaming to influence price in the dayahead market In PJM and NYISO parties submit false load and generation schedules in set price most often this is a low ball load estimatethen later the true load is scheduled I think there is less of a problem with the hourahead market since the opportunity to submit a false bid to set price and then replace it later is very limited if not nonexistent Unbalance Schedules The general direction we are going for Eastern ISOs is to allow unbalance schedules in the realtime market Tim indicated a few weeks ago that he still wants this feature Normally there would be no imbalance penalties however when reserve margins are so slim that the systems security is in jeopardy penalties would be triggered The result is that parties can choose to use the realtime market or they can choose bilateral schedules or a combination They are not compelled to do either As long as reserves are adequate then why should we care Unit Commitment Although not on your list I think the primary problems that the DayAhead Market is trying to solve is unit commitment While this may be the intended purpose it hasnt worked very well Centralized unit commitment would address the problem but then the operator decisions have a large impact on prices without having any consequences We need a proposal for making sure that resources will be on line and that the operator knows they will be in place A possible approach may be as follows as suggested by Mike Roan The Operator publishes its expected realtime price for the next hours based on information supplied by generators regarding their availability and bid price one part and the ISOs estimate of hourly loads The estimates roll forward every hour to that a continuous two day outlook is provided to all market participants The Operator provides the demandsupply curves to the market so everyone has the same information As units are committed and load forecast is adjusted the estimate of realtime prices changes providing signals for units to use in deciding to commit units As expected price rises more units are committed and price goes down At a given point in time such as hours ahead of realtime the Operator locks units in as committed If there are inadequate units committed it pays to add capacity call contracts If not enough is voluntarily bid the Operator orders units on under emergency rules contained in interconnectionintegration agreements with the generators The cost of the call contracts or of units ordered on is included in the cost of imbalance energy in realtime for the hours for which those costs were incurred This procedure is a continuous bid type of approach which provides signals and information to the market It or some other procedure like it is needed to address the Operators concerns that it will be able to operate the system and to deal with the overly conservative tendencies of a notforprofit ISO Steve Alan Comnes PM To james d nron cc Subject CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Here are some initial reactions and questions to the CAISO market stabilization plan which is attached Give me or Sue Mara your comments and then we can turn it into message points for media advocacy folks In addition to reviewing the plan I listened in to part of a stakeholder call that occured Friday am PST DRAFT MESSAGE POINTS With limited exceptions the plan does nothing to increase supply or decrease demand It primarily addresses costs and market stability INTERESTING QUOTES Over the edge into cost based regulation Duke Power Although the plan provides for cost control and for improving market stability whatever that means the ISO staffer Byron Wortz who presented the study admitted it Will do nothing to increase supply this summer A staffer Lorenzo stated paraphrased all out of state suppliers are cost of service based and do not need to recieve market based rates ON SPECIFICS The Ugly Resourcespecific cost based bid caps RSBC or bid caps cost of service regulation that disincent supply The ISO will hold instate resources hostagecuts any exports when reserves fall below a stated critera Imports can only participate as price takers Thus if the highestcost instate resource is below the opportunity cost of power needed imports will not come in this will decrease supply Staffer stated ISO hopes to sign longer term deals if necessary to secure outofstate power but acknowledged the proposal needs more work The Bad The ISO is considering pay as bid which is complex and does not increase supply However on the call they said they are leaing to a single price auction However with bid caps the market will still be distorted The Good The ISO wll implement an hourly dayahead and hourahead market essentially filling a void created by the PXs demise Enron has strongly advocated market seperation in the past but do we want to consider supporting a day ahead market Market separation rules MSR ISO is leaning towards option in which SCs submit bundled schedules but that market seperation would be suspended after congestion process is conducted ie final schedules may be imbalanced What do we think of this

Gus nron Angela nron Sharonda StephensCorpEnron Eric NRON Amber CT Merle CT Kerryann CT Makiko nron Subject Budget UpdateHiring Committee Formation In a recent organizational memo I mentioned what a great time this is to b e at Enron I believe that more strongly than ever given the new markets we are entering the enhanced focus of the company on markets and regions arou nd the world that best fit with our core competencies and the phenomenal grow th of the company perhaps best evidenced by the earnings report of the first quarter But there are challenges as well California and its regional a nd global implications and the general market conditions that have brought ou r stock price well off its recent highs With respect to each of these and other challenges there are invariably opportunities for example the enhanced opportunity for the FERC to finish the job of opening wholesale electricity markets in the context of California and in the context of a lower stock price a recognition that accelerated growth in earnings will bring the stock price to new highs in the not too distant future One way that earnings can grow beyond Wall Street expectations is by bringing a bit more discipline to how all of us spend money at Enron We in Government Affairs can point to many efforts and processes that have been designed to instill that spending and resource allocation discipline in the last few years We have always done our part but there is always more that can be done To increase earnings and correspondingly the stock price I recently met with various Government Affairs group heads to discuss ways Government Affairs can do things better and more cost effectively We looked at group travel costs outside services and other budget items Attached for your review and use is a copy of a new Travel Policy and new Cell Phone Policy which I believe will ensure consistency across the group and deliver cost savings Such travel policies already exist in various regions such as Enr on Europe Regional Business Unit travel policies will continue to be applied where applicable Further as a result of our review of the budget we have identified saving s across the North American group in excess of million dollars USD Th is is in addition to almost million dollars USD by which the Enron Europe Government Affairs budget has been reduced as well as significant reductio ns that have occurred in the South American group Finally I have also decide d to create a global government affairs hiring committee which will evaluate the need for any proposed hires new and existing positions The purpose of the committee will be to assess whether the need is valid and assuming it is determine the most effective way to fill the position By encompassing a crosssection of the Government Affairs group globally it is my hope that we will arrive at better hiring decisions The hiring committee will consist of Aleck Dadson Toronto Sue Nord Houston Jim Steffes Houston Paul Dawson London Doug Wood London Nick ODay Tokyo Sergio Assad S ao Paulo Linda Robertson Washington and myself The committee will meet on an as needed basis I believe that these changes will allow us all the opportunity to provide more cost effective and efficient service to the business units we support I encourage each of you to review the new policies and provide feedback Thank you

James D ES Richard ES cc Joe nron Sarah nron Charles CT Richard CT Subject Joes group accomplishments in SO FAR Per Jims request for the database I dont know if you want to put the values that Kevin is giving into the database Completed the negotiations and FERC filing of the Next Hour Market scheduling proposal When implemented scheduled for June this will provide one stop shopping for next hour business Ties OASIS and TAGGING together into one request Also if a tranmission provider cuts the transmission the PSE only pays for his actual use versus what he originally scheduled This will speed up the ability to schedule the next hour nonfirm This order is an important recognition by FERC that its OATT did not cover hourly which we complained about alot at FERCs hotline last summer Successful in obtaining the release of all ISN system information to marketers in the WSCC region This was an individual effort by Dick that h as been benificial for our traders in the WEST Successfully prevented the WS CC Operating Committee from taking action that would have reversed this effort Assisted in getting the initial control areas in SERC approved last ye ar and preventing ATC changes this year and OC changes that would have negated the Control Area effort Dick served as Co CHAIR of the ISO committee that put the SPP contract in place that eliminated MW mile pricing in SPP and will serve as the basis for SPPs RTO Dick was appointed to the NERC Control Area Task Force which was formed as a result of our the success of the Enron Control Areas in TVA and have s o far been successful in keeping this effort so that it is non punitive Thi s has turned into a very positive process that may result in a new configuration of the NERC relibiability effort Dicks made comments to ENTERGY that helped push Entergy into filing their new scheduling procedure ultimate source and sink with FERC This was initially going to be implemented unilaterally March without a FERC filing and Enron would have been forced into an after the fact complaint situation at FERC where we are not allowed to get damages that we would hav e incurred in the meantime See Comm Masseys concurrence in Aquila v Enter gy about the lack of incentive to file complaints Kevin Presto said that winning the protest at FERC due would be worth MM On TECO revised its proposed generator imbalance charge from minute by minute to hourly accountability notably TECO revised its propos al before FERC issued an order based on the EPSA protest herein We worked wi th EPSA to file an EPSA protest to TECOs proposal We didnt like TECO s proposal but had commercial concerns about filing a protest in our own name since Enron is working with TECO on a project We were able to get EPSA to protest this issue in TECOs initial filing Enron is planning to site generation in Florida but we dont have the value on this win yet FERC issued a NOPR on January proposing to revise the way it assesses annual charges to public utilities Enron along with several other participants Dynegy Koch APX Citizens NP Energy Sonat a nd Williams filed a petition for rulemaking with FERC in August requesting FERC to revise its methodology for assessing annual charges arguing that FERCs current system of assessing annual charges on sales for resale of power discourages trading impedes reliance on competitive market s for power and could create competitive advantages for utilities over new power marketers entering the market We proposed that FERC either assess i ts costs on transmission only or reallocate the amounts that it collects through sales transactions versus transmission transactions Although FERC does not grant our petition and in fact dismisses it as moot the petition served its purpose In the NOPR FERC notes that because most of its time is spent on transmission issues a point that we made in the Petition it is appropria te to assess costs only on the MWh of electric energy transmitted in interstat e commerce by public utilities Under the current assessment system FERC divides its costs between transmission and sales Now FERC is proposing to collect its costs solely through transmission FERC justifies this change because it spends most of its time on transmission issues and because transmission providers can collect the fees through transmission charges assessed to users of the grid FERC proposes to asses its costs to unbundled wholesale transmission unbundled retail transmission and bundled wholesale power sales Bundled native load transactions will apparently avoid assessments of any FERCrelated costs however EPSA and Enron are protesting this issue at FERC Jim Steffes has been working on a calculation of additional value Interconnection Policy Utilizing EPSA efforts including Sarahs meeting with FERC we got the policy statement we urged FERC to put forth in the forum we suggested ie an existing proceeding in the Tennessee Powe r order where FERC said interconnection procedures should follow the pro form a tariff including that a generator doesnt have to request transmission and interconnection at the same time We worked with EPSA to draft the Model interconnection agreement that EPSA filed at FERC in the Entergy interconnection proposal AEPCSW order approved the merger but accepted intervenors testimony showing market power and conditioned merger on an independent calculation of ATC postings which we proposed and independent market monitor soon after the merger occurs with RTO participation by Kevin Presto said the independent ATC calculation is worth MM to Enron Note we are going to propose MAIN instead of SPP which AEP chose Kev in said that AEPs ATC calculation can trump all interfaces in ECAR so this h as a positive effect not just on AEP but on all of ECAR MAPP FERC further order on refunds MAPP refused to refund moni es that it was unable to collect from a nonjurisdictional member transmission owner NPPD EPMI filed a protest to MAPPs refund report arguing that MAPP was ordered to make full refunds and it violated that order FERC agreed with Enron and rejected MAPPs refund report FERC said MAPP must refun d the full amount to transmission customers whether or not it was able to collec t that money from NPPD Results in another of refunds for EPMI Sarah is working on the PGE sale

AM To Richard NRON cc Subject Re Energy Services CoaltionVisit To London Friday December I guess because of the way the message was sent to me I cannot include text in return but responding to your question of what does Joes last comment mean presumably it is that on these issues of WTO I am not competent to advise you on them Leaving that aside I further suspect that he sees me as the bette noir of the WTO ESC effort Finally you might talk to Tom Briggs I think Joe has stood Toms position on its head Joe has argued that we need to be in the ESC because other things we care about like financial services regulation and ecommerce will be implicated He says Tom argues that we must liberalise energy to realise these objectives As I understand Tom and he can speak for himself if we do not get energy services liberalised and the exclusion of thirdparty access is tantamount to not getting energy services liberalised then the makeweight arguments about ecommerce and financial services

Schroeder To Steven J nron Richard nron cc Subject RE Energy Services Tom Briggs was good enough to forward to me a piece of correspondence that Joe Hillings apparently shared with him My lack of enthusiasm for our WTO initiative I know has hardly been masked but frankly what is contained in the incoming letter below I find quite disconcerting I have argued that in our key markets eg Europe Japan etc I am assuming we do not need it in the USA even today the WTO initiative ie liberalisation of energy siervices would be of little value by the time it was implemented I had apparently mistakenly at least assumed that liberalisation of energy siervices at a minimum meant thirdparty access to transmission networks If not then what the heck are we doing in this fight BUT as you will see from the incoming below when Paul Hennemeyer of my team here in London joined Joe and Bob Fisher in Geneva to do a presentation on liberalisation of energy services in WTO it provoked a letter to which Joe responded saying that the US Energy Services Coalition has NEVER taken a position on thrid party access and it is doubtful they could agree to such a position Joe agreed and said this was just an Enron company position You can probably guess my position on this but I thought I would forward this to you for your information and if warranted follow up as the conversations we have had

fax email Brian Thank you for your thoughtful and complete statement of the issue The ESC has not taken any position on the regulatory details of market access nor advocated any such as Third Party Access although Enron certainly has taken a public position at the EU and other venues preferring TPA but willing to be practical about the issue I greatly appreciate your cutting through to the concern It is helpful and hopefully will help us in future presentations I know it will help me Regards Joe Raggett Brian AM To cc Arscott Lyn Subject RE Energy Services Joe Having raised the matter covered by the exchange of emails between yourself and Lyn I feel I should clarify my observations of the meeting at the WTO I am confident that the WTO representatives were better informed and enlightened by the presentations given by the ESC I am sure they were also struck as was I by Pauls enthusiastic explanation of the range of innovative energy services offered by Enron What sparked my concern was the reference to access to energy networks Personally I do not and more importantly nor does OGP take a position on TPA in the EU to which you refer in your communication Even more so in the context of the WTO because it has never been discussed I surmise though that other ESC members would have similar reservations My concerns were heightened by questions on the subject raised by one or two of our interlocutors This part of the discussion then broadened somewhat and included information about a court case in Germany to overcome entrenched opposition to TPA by certain network operators I know not whom I believe it would be a pity if the broader aspects of energy services supported generally by the ESC became subsumed by a debate on TPA to either nationally or privately owned networks to which some WTO governments outside Europe and the United States maybe opposed While I detected concerns about this in the questions asked I dont think that the baby was thrown away with the bathwater It is my view however that the ESC should be cautious about raising an issue which some governments may perceive to be outside what they think is a more reasonable agenda and to which rightly or wrongly they have antipathy My concern is that this may then be used to forestall the worthy and perhaps more achievable objectives of the ESC to include the wide range of services advocated in the main by Paul and by the others who presented I most certainly have a positive view on the value of your work and I hope this helps I am not sure at this point whether I will be

specifics of your concern so at the risk of prolonging the pain Ill make another stab at a response If the concern centers on liberalization of transmission access for electricity and natural gas I would respond that we want to see the EU electricity and natural gas directives fully implemented The EU had asked member countries to fully implement transmission access and it is being accomplished in a phased in approach Some member countries are doing it in a way that makes energy services possible some to a less degree and so far France has not adopted the implementing legislation which is a subject of concern to the EU The opening up of markets to the maximum degree possible is a broad goal of the Energy Services Coalition recognizing that this is a position that has to be negotiated We have not recommended any specific regulatory system or regime If I am still missing your concern please bear with me and bring me in closer to any concern that you may have Regards and best wishes Joe

cc Subject Background Information France Electricity Background The Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate d monopoly business to a competitive market A segment of electricity users n ow have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers The emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded wholesale market Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in December member states were obliged to transpose the directive into national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February The directive sets out a threetiered approach to the liberalisation of electricity supply markets Stage one entered into effect on February and calls for the opening of of national markets based on the average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more than GWh per year The degree of opening will increase over six years by lowering the community consumption threshold to GWh in market opening and to GWh in market opening Distributor access i s a matter for each member state The implementation of a new directive expected in will improve the conditions for a liberalized market At present the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe r states The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are Germany Austria Spain and the Netherlands Switzerland although it is no t an EU member state is integral to market developments France although having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive has proven to open up their market more than expected Current Market EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France the largest power producer in the world with TWh generated in and the largest exporter in Europe net exports reached TWh in Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EDF is a vertically integrated company with services and products in generation supply transmission a nd distribution Finally this historical supplier is a State Entity th e French State owns EDFs capital A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TW h hydro Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their production to EDF under a regulated tariff More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession areas The French System Operator RTE was created on July and is a subdivision of EDF although it is unbundled in terms of management and accounting A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the transitional regime which varies according to the voltage used and is base d on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract for thei r maximum transmission capacity Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW A threeyear framework contract eg by way of a Master Agreement with a minimum term of three years is required for eligible customers but eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a threeyear contractual framework Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created balancing responsibility contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which compel s the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a tolerance level or MW Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France the ability to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process t he availability of market prices and optional structures The establishment of balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France and this through the exchange of blocks from one perimeter to another Blocs are only exchangeable on dayahead bases but intraday procedures are expected to be implemented Al l transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number of players for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is a balancing responsible actor in France and closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was t he very first new entrant to trade power buysell in France late Future Developments Frances size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for trading on the Continent It is Europes second largest electricity market with net consumption including industrial onsite consumption totalling over TWh in The increase of physical trading envisaged capacity release by EDF and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to the further development of the market Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producer consumer and providing it with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EDF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met Recently the European Commission has asked EDF to auction MW of virtu al capacity through VPP auctions starting in September representing abou t of the market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity Regulatory Environment The goal of Directive EC concerning the internal market in electricit y is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness in the face of price decreases France has transposed the directive however certain imperfection with regards to nondiscriminatory access and the leve l of liberalisation still exist The French Electricity law was passed on February a year later th an required by the EU establishing a transitional regime for third party acce ss TPA Several application decrees still have to be passed including transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers The current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per ye ar and per site and represents about eligible clients and sites Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible consumption of customers located in their concession areas The French powe r market is effectively open to some competition and about eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive by Feb as the French governme nt declined a quicker opening of the power market The two main authorities which oversee the industry are the CRE Commissi on de Regulation de lElectricit is the official regulatory body and the ministry of industry The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo r nondiscriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation tariffs The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for IPPs and for determining eligibility issues RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK Italy and Spain interconnectors On the remaining borders capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule and congestion fees are levied at the margin which favours longterm contracts and historical players In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to RTE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports an d imports However an intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity is likely to be changed by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision of the Ministry of Industry the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers a maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Although the interpretation of this law is unclear a recent statement by M Tuot Director General of the CRE implies that these restrictions only apply to French authorised producers and thus not to foreignbased energy companies or other nonproducing entities Thus these restrictions do not apply to ECTR L as we are not registered in France In addition French IPPs are free to sell and export their production Eligible customers who are physically connected to the Grid have to contract for

contract coupled with grid access contracts import export andor transit are required by RTE A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer setting up new conditions for transmission transits and

Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EdF owns of power generation and of distribution A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TWh hydro Other small IPPs sell their production to EdF under a regulated tariff There has been significan t development of cogeneration projects since There is now MW of installed capacity thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe r generated from cogeneration units at a preferable is preferable the correct word tariff In the view of the transposition of the EU Electricity Directive into French law this purchase obligation ceased to apply for new large projects over MW from st Jan More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession area Regulatory Environment The French Electricity law was passed on February implementing regulated third party access TPA in France under a transitional regime T he law was approved one year late failing to meet the required EU deadline Dozens Dozens I would replace this with Several of application decrees still have to be passed including tariffs to eligible industrials The French power market is open to competition however About eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier Current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per year and per site representing about eligible clients and sites The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive in Feb as the French government declined a quicker opening of the power market Eligibility of distribution companies is limited to the eligible consumptio n of customers located in their concession area A threeyear framework contract eg by way of a Master Agreement with a minimum term of three years is required for eligible customers but eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a three year contractual framework New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision from the Ministry of Industry which is the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t o eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Trading is currently defined as the conditio ns of power purchase for resale to eligible customers These Trading restrictions however do not apply to ECTRL as we are not registered in France IPPs are free to sell and export power The French System Operator RTE was created on July and is a subdivision of EdF although it is unbundled in terms of management and accounting A postage stamp tariff was implemented under the transitional regime which varies according to the voltage usedand which is based on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract transmission u p to the maximum capacity that they will use RTE purchases excess capacity available through transmission contracts at fixed prices which represents about half of the market price Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created programme responsible contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which allow the aggregation of imbalance charges for differen t eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Eligible customers who are physically connected to the Grid have to contract for transmission visvis RTE Contrat Made Traders such as ECTRL are not required to have such a transmission contract as they do no t consume the power they purchase Only a programme responsible contract coupled with grid access contracts import export andor transit are required by RTE A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer setting up new conditions for transmission transits and exports under a permanent regime It is likely that this new tariff will implement a injection delive ry calculation factor Imports which are allocated on a prorata basis are free of transmission charges Programme responsible contracts have established the basis of trading in France through the exchange of blocs from one perimeter to another Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is programme responsible in France Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule by RTE and congestion fees are levied at the margin whi ch favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player s In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R TE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports and imports This allocation rule is likely to change by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come The CRE Commission de Regulation de lElectricite is the offical regulato ry body which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues while IPP licenses and eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry Business Opportunity Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France the abilit y to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage between the flexibility of the industrial process market prices and optional structures The establishment of programme responsible contrac ts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France ECTRL closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was the very first new entrant to trade power buysell in Franc e late An intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports and is expected to soon be extended to exchange of blocs in France Liquidity has been dramatically increasing although the market remains dominated by the historical player thanks to RTE capacity auctions for auction has not been implemented on Spanish side yet QUERY do we need this bit in brackets What does it add Cant we just delete it Or i s it a note and someone has to write some better text here It just does no t read correctly in English owing to its place in the sentence at present UK Italy and Spain interconnectors RTE tenders for HV Grid losses industrial s switching and new players coming into the market In addition the Europea n Commission has determined that EdF will auction MW of virtual capacity through VPP and PPA auctions in September representing about of t he market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity A network code is currently under discussion between market players and RTE Future Development It is forecasted that both balancing market and spot exchange market will b e implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options which will be exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producerconsumer thus providing RTE with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services The Some of the spot market volume is expected to be run by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EdF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met ECTRL has actively been lobbying in order to have fa ir and transparent rules implemented for every player in the market and has actively contributed for a spot market to take place However thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly The Gas Market Situation A transitional regime was implemented on August by direct applicati on of the EU Directive thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose consumption is over million cubic meters pa The eligibility threshold will be reduced to million cubic meters in and million cubic mete rs in No gas law has been passed yet forecasted mid and its is expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end A zonaldistancerelated tariff was disclosed published on July by GdFTransportation A permanent entryexit tariff structure is likely to be developed for Charges for imbalances are expensive and access t o storage is restricted GdFTrading however has published conditions for balancing services There is only one trading Hub for France located at the FrenchBelgian bord er BlaregniesTaisniSres Due to the distancerelated nature of the transportation tariff competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a re located not too far less than about Km from the FrenchBelgian border The main imports into France are for high cal gas and GdF has published th e conditions for high callow cal gas swaps As there is not yet a new gas law in France a Projet de Loi was approved on th May transposing the EU Gas Directive into domestic legislation the Regulatory Commission has not been appointed todate and the official regulatory body remains the Ministry of Industry Although current conditions do not facilitate full requirement supply to customers from new entrants it is already possible to optimise gas supply through import of blocs for part or full supply ECTRL was the first new entrant to supply gas at the French border and more recently into France ECTRLs cumulative volume of gas trades so far totals million cubic meters

for each phase and product specifications AND understand how the consultation process will work once we have the IM Hence need to discuss with MTF then Trustee and CRE asap ie in June if possible Preferably before we meet again with PWCRoth In addition to Pierres comments the PIM also states that strike prices at least are subject to Trustee review but a number of areas need to be questioned Capacity Release Phasing PIM confirms the year period of the remdey b ut also says a review can be requested after years Bruno you need to review the remedy doc but I do not see how a year phasing of capacity release complies with the remedy at least in spirit We would suggest there is no impediment to offering the FULL remedy in a single phase If theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to release unsold capacity on a monthly or annual basis through the year period The current proposal is no more than EdF trying to minimise capaci ty release andor extract max value cant blame them for trying but it is not what we want or what remedy requires EdFs only real argument is that phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblit y threshold drops in France However since eligible demand already exceeds total capacity release this would limit development of competition to existing eligibles As a minimum the release programme for all capacity should be clearly defined up front not at the whim of EdF Peter though ts on this and how in context of remedy we can argue for accelerated single phase auction with possible reauctioning of unsold capacity over years Auction Process qualifying criteria likely to be more defined in IM bu t no obvious problems here I am less sure about nature of auction process We obviously need to think it through more but why not just have a simple process based on single sealed bids or an electronic bid process The us e of price clock controlled by the auctioneer may allow a reserve price to be set which is clearly not the intent of the remedy this should be set at zero for all product groups not subjectively to ensure excess demand but only for certain groups Product Specs need to understand what if anything can be changed here Strikes seem to be subject to Trustee approval but we need to understand what else can be influenced eg within day flex Since we have already covered

auction a total of megawatts which include MW of peak capacity sold at a price of euros per megawatt hour MWh and MW of baseload at a price of eight eurosMWh In addition MW of cogeneration production capacity will be made available Production from cogeneration plants is bought by EdF from smalle r producers under longterm contracts With such contracts electricity suppliers and traders will be able to hav e electricity without the technical and operational risks of running a power plant said EdF in a statement The price for cogeneration capacity will be made public a few weeks before the auction as it depends on gas price movements EdF said The auction will take place in several tranches the first one starting in September when MW of peak capacity will be auctioned MW of baselo ad and MW of

Infrastructure issued Resolution setting forth the guidelines for the future regulation of the Decree The Secretariat of Energys resolution that will regulate the Decree will be effective as from September All agents of the electric sector will be invited to comment the terms of regulatory decree although such comments will be used for informational purposes and will not bind the Secretariat of Energy to make any changes whatsoever to its original document Although Decree No is effective as from today there are doubts in the industry as to whether it will be abolished in the future by Congress The reason for this uncertainty is that such Decree was issued within the framework of the Competitivity Law by which Congress delegated to the Executive Branch its powers to legislate specifically on changes required to transform the economy Although this Decree and the changes it fosters indirectly affect the economy since the law it amends is not purely economical it may be questioned There is no term within which Congress may exercise this right Please find a summary of the relevant changes below Generators Remuneration Forward Market freely negotiated Spot Market only

Furnas to cover the situation where the commissioning plan did not go as scheduled It was signed early afternoon and sent to Eletrobras The Eletrobras Diretoria had not followed this issue closely and need legal clearance Furnas and the Ministry Perazzo called to give it priority Late at night we received word that the parecer opinion was ready and that it the Anex would signed by Eletrobras next Monday and entered into their Board meeting next Tuesday Petrobras sent us the letter we asked but took out of their version a key word only Only refers that they will not go after us for nonpayment if Furnas does not pay In the letter they also stated that they will commence the loading operation at their own risk Saturday This was requested by Perazzo to save logistical time because it takes three days to get to Cuiaba from the refinery Advised Laine of the situation to check Monday how many trucks were loaded and in transit We contacted Perazzo through Sergio Assad to get his word that there would not be a last minute hitch otherwise we may have to refuse to take the diesel and would create a BIG PR problem for all Topic III Consent Package Opinions Aditivo Consent Furnas came in with the list of issues they wanted to discuss I instead insisted that we treat this meeting as a continuation of the MME meeting and follow the Agenda by looking at the Consent document package actually go over the text that they find objectionable and if it the text had a direct link with any of their issues we would discuss and examine the relative positions What they told me is what they have told me before that some of the issues have nothing to do with the Consent but they want it as a condition to agree to the package Which is fine to me because it will make it clear to the government what we have been saying they want to change the deal In Furnas defense I need to add that they feel they have been handed a bad contract and they want regulatory relief which it has been granted on a casebycase basis in other deals So part of their strategy is to force MME or Aneel to provide some tariff relief I asked them to list out the key issues with the Consent Old a the days additional time Furnas b The guarantee substitution at the time of privatization c the lenders involvement on contract changes we do not want to go to Washington to negotiate Newer d giving up their right to ask Aneel to homologar ratify rather than registrar contract changes big risk for us I believe the have more direct issues We go back to Rio Monday another holiday down the drain and Tuesday

cc Subject Background Information France Electricity Background The Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate d monopoly business to a competitive market A segment of electricity users n ow have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers The emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded wholesale market Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in December member states were obliged to transpose the directive into national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February The directive sets out a threetiered approach to the liberalisation of electricity supply markets Stage one entered into effect on February and calls for the opening of of national markets based on the average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more than GWh per year The degree of opening will increase over six years by lowering the community consumption threshold to GWh in market opening and to GWh in market opening Distributor access i s a matter for each member state The implementation of a new directive expected in will improve the conditions for a liberalized market At present the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe r states The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are Germany Austria Spain and the Netherlands Switzerland although it is no t an EU member state is integral to market developments France although having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive has proven to open up their market more than expected Current Market EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France the largest power producer in the world with TWh generated in and the largest exporter in Europe net exports reached TWh in Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EDF is a vertically integrated company with services and products in generation supply transmission a nd distribution Finally this historical supplier is a State Entity th e French State owns EDFs capital A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TW h hydro Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their production to EDF under a regulated tariff More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession areas The French System Operator RTE was created on July and is a subdivision of EDF although it is unbundled in terms of management and accounting A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the transitional regime which varies according to the voltage used and is base d on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract for thei r maximum transmission capacity Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW A threeyear framework contract eg by way of a Master Agreement with a minimum term of three years is required for eligible customers but eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a threeyear contractual framework Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created balancing responsibility contracts contrats de Responsable dEquilibre which compel s the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a tolerance level or MW Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France the ability to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process t he availability of market prices and optional structures The establishment of balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in France and this through the exchange of blocks from one perimeter to another Blocs are only exchangeable on dayahead bases but intraday procedures are expected to be implemented Al l transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number of players for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly Enron Capital Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is a balancing responsible actor in France and closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was t he very first new entrant to trade power buysell in France late Future Developments Frances size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for trading on the Continent It is Europes second largest electricity market with net consumption including industrial onsite consumption totalling over TWh in The increase of physical trading envisaged capacity release by EDF and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to the further development of the market Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producer consumer and providing it with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EDF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met Recently the European Commission has asked EDF to auction MW of virtu al capacity through VPP auctions starting in September representing abou t of the market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity Regulatory Environment The goal of Directive EC concerning the internal market in electricit y is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness in the face of price decreases France has transposed the directive however certain imperfection with regards to nondiscriminatory access and the leve l of liberalisation still exist The French Electricity law was passed on February a year later th an required by the EU establishing a transitional regime for third party acce ss TPA Several application decrees still have to be passed including transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers The current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per ye ar and per site and represents about eligible clients and sites Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible consumption of customers located in their concession areas The French powe r market is effectively open to some competition and about eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive by Feb as the French governme nt declined a quicker opening of the power market The two main authorities which oversee the industry are the CRE Commissi on de Regulation de lElectricit is the official regulatory body and the ministry of industry The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo r nondiscriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation tariffs The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for IPPs and for determining eligibility issues RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK Italy and Spain interconnectors On the remaining borders capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule and congestion fees are levied at the margin which favours longterm contracts and historical players In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to RTE realtime data on the capacity availableused for exports an d imports However an intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity is likely to be changed by end In addition the CRE is likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision of the Ministry of Industry the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers a maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Although the interpretation of this law is unclear a recent statement by M Tuot Director General of the CRE implies that these restrictions only apply to French authorised producers and thus not to foreignbased energy companies or other nonproducing entities Thus these restrictions do not

nuclear production The historical supplier who is at the same time the largest exporter of power in Europe net exports reached TWh in is a direct emanation from the French State who owns EdF capital Power generation in France is mainly nuclear but also hydro while conventional thermal generation represents EdF owns of power generation and of distribution A few Independent Power Producers IPP are also active in the market such as Snet TWh coalfired and CNR TWh hydro Other small IPPs sell their production to EdF under a regulated tariff There has been significan t development of cogeneration projects since There is now MW of installed capacity thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe r generated from cogeneration units at a preferable is preferable the correct word tariff In the view of the transposition of the EU Electricity Directive into French law this purchase obligation ceased to apply for new large projects over MW from st Jan More than distribution companies are active through a concession regime in their local distribution area Few however are of a significant size less than a dozen have sales of over GWhs or have eligible customers in their concession area Regulatory Environment The French Electricity law was passed on February implementing regulated third party access TPA in France under a transitional regime T he law was approved one year late failing to meet the required EU deadline Dozens Dozens I would replace this with Several of application decrees still have to be passed including tariffs to eligible industrials The French power market is open to competition however About eligible industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical supplier Current threshold for eligibility is GWh net of autoconsumption per year and per site representing about eligible clients and sites The eligibility threshold will be reduced to GWh per site by direct application of the EU Directive in Feb as the French government declined a quicker opening of the power market Eligibility of distribution companies is limited to the eligible consumptio n of customers located in their concession area A threeyear framework contract eg by way of a Master Agreement with a minimum term of three years is required for eligible customers but eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a three year contractual framework New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision from the Ministry of Industry which is the main route for authorisation Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t o eligible customers a volume equivalent to of the installed capacity including long term contracts Trading is currently defined as the conditio ns of power purchase for resale to eligible customers These Trading restrictions however do not apply to ECTRL as we are not registered in France IPPs are free to sell and export power The French System

varies according to the voltage usedand which is based on a matrix SummerWinter PeakOffPeak Users have to contract transmission u p to the maximum capacity that they will use RTE purchases excess capacity available through transmission contracts at fixed prices which represents about half of the market price Imbalances are settled under a published tariff which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a tolerance level and MW Although the criteria for eligibility is per site and eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site RTE has created programme responsible

Trade Resources Limited ECTRL is programme responsible in France Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a firstcomefirst served basis rule by RTE and congestion fees are levied at the margin whi ch favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player s In addition there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R TE realtime data on the capacity

de Regulation de lElectricite is the offical regulato ry body which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues while IPP licenses and eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry Business Opportunity Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France the abilit y to trade power already exists Optimisation can be found through realtime arbitrage between the flexibility of

ECTRL closed the first physical power transaction in France early and was the very first new entrant to trade power buysell in Franc e late An intraday market is now effective for transits imports and exports and is expected to soon be extended to exchange of blocs in France Liquidity has been dramatically increasing although the market remains dominated by the historical player thanks to RTE capacity auctions for auction has not been implemented on Spanish side yet QUERY do we need this bit in brackets What does it add Cant we just delete it Or i s it a note and someone has to write some better text here It just does no t read correctly in English owing to its place in the sentence at present UK Italy and Spain interconnectors RTE tenders for HV Grid losses industrial s switching and new players coming into the market In addition the Europea n Commission has determined that EdF will auction MW of virtual capacity through VPP and PPA auctions in September representing about of t he market for French eligible industrials This will further contribute to increase liquidity A network code is currently under discussion between market players and RTE Future Development It is forecasted that both balancing market and spot exchange market will b e implemented by end Players in the balancing market will propose put a nd call options which will be exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts producerconsumer thus providing RTE with physical balancing capacity The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing services The Some of the spot market volume is expected to be run by ParisBourse However due to the dominant position of EdF the limited number of active IPPs existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of crossborder capacity and attribution of congestion costs we believe that the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France are not yet fully met ECTRL has actively been lobbying in order to have fa ir and transparent rules implemented for every player in the market and has actively contributed for a spot market to take place However thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading imports exports and transit we are confident that the French power market will develop rapidly The Gas Market Situation A transitional regime was implemented on August by direct applicati on of the EU Directive thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose consumption is over million cubic meters pa The eligibility threshold will be reduced to million cubic meters in and million cubic mete rs in No gas law has been passed yet forecasted mid and its is expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end A zonaldistancerelated tariff was disclosed published on July by GdFTransportation A permanent entryexit tariff structure is likely to be developed for Charges for imbalances are expensive and access t o storage is restricted GdFTrading however has published conditions for balancing services There is only one trading Hub for France located at the FrenchBelgian bord er BlaregniesTaisniSres Due to the distancerelated nature of the transportation tariff competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a re located not too far less than about Km from the FrenchBelgian border The main imports into France are for high cal gas and GdF has published th e conditions for high callow cal gas swaps As there is not yet a new gas law in France a Projet de Loi was approved on th May transposing the EU Gas Directive into domestic legislation the Regulatory Commission has not been appointed todate and the official regulatory body remains the Ministry of Industry Although current conditions do not facilitate full requirement supply to customers from new entrants it is already possible to optimise gas supply through import of blocs for part or full supply ECTRL was the first new entrant to supply gas at the French border and more recently into France ECTRLs cumulative volume of gas trades so far totals million cubic meters

state Does not appear to be any need to deal with credit support or other regulatory qualifiers such as balancing agreements as yet Mark agree Bruno could you please take care of sending this registration letter agr ee with Pierre who should act as principal contact Establish once and for all the role of Trustee and CRE in the process of approving capacity release phasing auction process for each phase and product specifications AND understand how the consultation process will work once we have the IM Hence need to discuss with MTF then Trustee and CRE asap ie in June if possible Preferably before we meet again with PWCRoth In addition to Pierres comments the PIM also states that strike prices at least are subject to Trustee review but a number of areas need to be questioned Capacity Release Phasing PIM confirms the year period of the remdey b ut also says a review can be requested after years Bruno you need to review the remedy doc but I do not see how a year phasing of capacity release complies with the remedy at least in spirit We would suggest there is no impediment to offering the FULL remedy in a single phase If theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to release unsold capacity on a monthly or annual basis through the year period The current proposal is no more than EdF trying to minimise capaci ty release andor extract max value cant blame them for trying but it is not what we want or what remedy requires EdFs only real argument is that phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblit y threshold drops in France However since eligible demand already exceeds total capacity release this would limit development of competition to existing eligibles As a minimum the release programme for all capacity should be clearly defined up front not at the whim of EdF Peter though ts on this and how in context of remedy we can argue for accelerated single phase auction with possible reauctioning of unsold capacity over years Auction Process qualifying criteria likely to be more defined in IM bu t no obvious problems here I am less sure about nature of auction process We obviously need to think it through more but why not just have a simple process based on single sealed bids or an electronic bid process The us e of price clock controlled by the auctioneer may allow a reserve price to be set which is clearly not the intent of the remedy this should be set at zero for all product groups not subjectively to ensure excess demand but only for certain groups Product Specs need to understand what if anything can be changed here Strikes seem to be subject to Trustee approval but we need to understand what else can be influenced eg within day flex Since we have already covered

auction a total of megawatts which include MW of peak capacity sold at a price of euros per megawatt hour MWh and MW of baseload at a price of eight eurosMWh In addition MW of cogeneration production capacity will be made available Production from cogeneration plants is bought by EdF from smalle r producers under longterm contracts With such contracts electricity suppliers and traders will be able to hav e electricity without the technical and operational risks of running a power plant said EdF in a statement The price for cogeneration capacity will be made public a few weeks before the auction as it depends on gas price movements EdF said The auction will take place in several tranches the first one starting in September when MW of peak capacity will be auctioned MW of baselo ad and MW of

nron cc james d nron Subject Re CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Alan DayAhead HourAhead Markets Market separation rules aside we should resist any mandatory DayAhead Market The results for dayahead clearing markets have been bid gaming to influence price in the dayahead market In PJM and NYISO parties submit false load and generation schedules in set price most often this is a low ball load estimatethen later the true load is scheduled I think there is less of a problem with the hourahead market since the opportunity to submit a false bid to set price and then replace it later is very limited if not nonexistent Unbalance Schedules The general direction we are going for Eastern ISOs is to allow unbalance schedules in the realtime market Tim indicated a few weeks ago that he still wants this feature Normally there would be no imbalance penalties however when reserve margins are so slim that the systems security is in jeopardy penalties would be triggered The result is that parties can choose to use the realtime market or they can choose bilateral schedules or a combination They are not compelled to do either As long as reserves are adequate then why should we care Unit Commitment Although not on your list I think the primary problems that the DayAhead Market is trying to solve is unit commitment While this may be the intended purpose it hasnt worked very well Centralized unit commitment would address the problem but then the operator decisions have a large impact on prices without having any consequences We need a proposal for making sure that resources will be on line and that the operator knows they will be in place A possible approach may be as follows as suggested by Mike Roan The Operator publishes its expected realtime price for the next hours based on information supplied by generators regarding their availability and bid price one part and the ISOs estimate of hourly loads The estimates roll forward every hour to that a continuous two day outlook is provided to all market participants The Operator provides the demandsupply curves to the market so everyone has the same information As units are committed and load forecast is adjusted the estimate of realtime prices changes providing signals for units to use in deciding to commit units As expected price rises more units are committed and price goes down At a given point in time such as hours ahead of realtime the Operator locks units in as committed If there are inadequate units committed it pays to add capacity call contracts If not enough is voluntarily bid the Operator orders units on under emergency rules contained in interconnectionintegration agreements with the generators The cost of the call contracts or of units ordered on is included in the cost of imbalance energy in realtime for the hours for which those costs were incurred This procedure is a continuous bid type of approach which provides signals and information to the market It or some other procedure like it is needed to address the Operators concerns that it will be able to operate the system and to deal with the overly conservative tendencies of a notforprofit ISO Steve Alan Comnes PM To james d nron cc Subject CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Here are some initial reactions and questions to the CAISO market stabilization plan which is attached Give me or Sue Mara your comments and then we can turn it into message points for media advocacy folks In addition to reviewing the plan I listened in to part of a stakeholder call that occured Friday am PST DRAFT MESSAGE POINTS With limited exceptions the plan does nothing to increase supply or decrease demand It primarily addresses costs and market stability INTERESTING QUOTES Over the edge into cost based regulation Duke Power Although the plan provides for cost control and for improving market stability whatever that means the ISO staffer Byron Wortz who presented the study admitted it Will do nothing to increase supply this summer A staffer Lorenzo stated paraphrased all out of state suppliers are cost of service based and do not need to recieve market based rates ON SPECIFICS The Ugly Resourcespecific cost based bid caps RSBC or bid caps cost of service regulation that disincent supply The ISO will hold instate resources hostagecuts any exports when reserves fall below a stated critera Imports can only participate as price takers Thus if the highestcost instate resource is below the opportunity cost of power needed imports will not come in this will decrease supply Staffer stated ISO hopes to sign longer term deals if necessary to secure outofstate power but acknowledged the proposal needs more work The Bad The ISO is considering pay as bid which is complex and does not increase supply However on the call they said they are leaing to a single price auction However with bid caps the market will still be distorted The Good The ISO wll implement an hourly dayahead and hourahead market essentially filling a void created by the PXs demise Enron has strongly advocated market seperation in the past but do we want to consider supporting a day ahead market Market separation rules MSR ISO is leaning towards option in which SCs submit bundled schedules but that market seperation would be suspended after congestion process is conducted ie final schedules may be imbalanced What do we think of this

and papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to address over the next few months These issues are extremely important to Enron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve most of these issues for many years There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it is ready to act and we need to be ready to respond In an effort to coordinate our efforts we have developed coverage teams to respond to these FERC initiatives The Washington advocacy group will also work closely with all of these teams If someone is interested in a particular issue and was not included on that team please feel free to call the Project Lead to have your name added to the team All assistance is welcome As you will see on the attached chart many of the deadlines for responding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks so the teams need to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly On the attached chart we have listed in the left column each of the FERC initiatives that will be starting or are currently underway A Project Lead has been named for each initiative The Project Lead will be responsible for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in the proceeding The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the next couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward The team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues should be addressed what is the best way for Enron to respond to them and producing draft comments Once draft comments are prepared the comments will be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enrons important issues There is a column of Inside Counsel and Outside Services In some areas we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not Where we do not list outside counsel we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments with significant input from the team members Please remember however that even if outside services are listed the RCR process must still be followed If applicable Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lead named for each proceeding RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October and we hope to have an executive from Enron make a presentation on one of the panels Comments will be submitted to FERC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs This team will also be responsible for these comments Standards of Conduct NOPR Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead Comments are due in approximately days Several issues are raised in this proceeding including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utilitys marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal ICAP Inquiry Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements whether they are needed and what impact such requirements have on the market Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed We will submit expert testimony on this issue California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation Alan Comnes will be the Project Lead Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible Furthermore a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California Californias summer peaking season is over but the Pacific Northwests winter peaking season will be starting soon and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest where it will be needed this winter This team will be responsible for both of these proceedings Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues Steve Walton is the Project Lead FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints Californias Path and the Central East Interface in New York and plans to have the study completed later this year The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it In a relating proceeding the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues The team will also oversee the progress in these proceedings Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements Susan Lindberg is the Project Lead The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market participants to provide more information than is currently required including at least seven additional data points per transaction This will have a significant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information Comments are due on October California Refund Proceeding Ray Alvarez is the Project Lead The Commission has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the California ISO from October through June and has established a hearing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding Bob Frank is the Project Lead The Judge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that refunds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest Briefs will be filed in response to the decision and the Commission will review the Judges order MidwestAlliance RTO Proceeding Mike Roan is the Project Lead Various filings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTOs in the Midwest the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO Enron is advocating consistent with the Commissions recent pronouncements one single RTO in the Midwest The Commission is expected to act on these filings shortly

Monday October AM To Shapiro Richard Subject Tavel advisory France I thought you and Jim might like this The following advice for American travellers going to France was compiled from information provided by the US State Department the CIA the US Chamber of Commerce the Food and Drug Administration the Centres for Disease Control and some very expensive spy satellites that the French dont know about It is intended as a guide for American travellers only General Overview France is a mediumsized foreign country situated in the continent of Europe It is an important member of the world community though not nearly as important as it thinks It is bounded by Germany Spain Switzerland and some smaller nations of no particular importance and with not very good shopping France is a very old country with many treasures such as the Louvre and Eurodisney Among its contributions to western civilization are champagne Camembert cheese and the guillotine Although France likes to think of itself as a modern nation air conditioning is little used and it is next to impossible for Americans to get decent Mexican food One continuing exasperation for American visitors is that local people insist on speaking in French though many will speak English if shouted at Watch your money at all times The People France has a population of million people million of these drink and smoke the other million are small children All French people drive like lunatics are dangerously oversexed and have no concept of standing patiently in a queue The French people are in general gloomy temperamental proud arrogant aloof and undisciplined those are their good points Most French citizens are Roman Catholic though you would hardly guess it from their behaviour Many people are communists Men sometimes have girls names like Marie or Michel and they kiss each other when they meet American travellers are advised to travel in groups and wear baseball caps and colourful trousers for easier recognition Safety In general France is a safe destination although travellers must be aware that from time to time it is invaded by Germany Traditionally the French surrender immediately and apart from a temporary shortage of Scotch whisky and increased difficulty in getting baseball scores and stock market prices life for the American visitor generally goes on much as before A tunnel connecting France to Britain beneath the English channel has been opened in recent years to make it easier for the French government to flee to London during future German invasions History France historical figures are King Louis the Huguenots Joan of Arc Jacques Cousteau and Charles de Gaulle who was President for many years and is now an airport The French were never very imaginative and all their kings were called Louis The French enjoyed their Revolution which set up their republic It was so successful that they did it again and again and again Government The French form of government is democratic but noisy Elections are held more or less continuously and always result in a draw The French love administration so for government purposes the country is divided into regions departments districts municipalities towns communes villages cafes and telephone kiosks Each of these has its own government and elections Parliament consists of two chambers the Upper and Lower though confusingly they are both on the ground floor and whose members are either Gaullists or Communists neither of whom should be trusted by the traveller Parliaments principal occupation is testing atomic bombs in the south Pacific and acting indignant and surprised when other countries complain and then complaining when the Arabs do the same in Paris According to the most current American state department intelligence the President is now someone named Jacques Further information is not available at this time Culture The French pride themselves on their culture though it is not easy to see why All their music sounds the same and they have never made a movie that you would want to watch for anything but the nude scenes Cuisine Lets face it no matter how much garlic you put on it a snail is just a slug with a shell on its back Croissants on the other hand are excellent although it is impossible for most Americans to pronounce this word In general travellers are advised to stick to cheeseburgers Economy France has a large and diversified economy second only to Germanys in Europe which is surprising because the French hardly work at all If they are not spending four hours dawdling over lunch they are on strike and blocking the roads with their trucks and tractors Frances principal exports in order of importance to the economy are wine nuclear weapons perfume guided missiles champagne guns grenade launchers land minestanks attack aircraft miscellaneous armaments and cheese Rick I have been forwarded this message quite to my surpriseconsidering my reputation I should probably not have sent this to you but I will concede to the humour I hope you will have fun Antoine Public Holidays France has more holidays than any other nation in the world Among its national holidays are Saints days National Liberation Days Declaration of Republic Days Return of Charles de Gaulle in triumph as if he won the war singlehanded Days Napolean sent into Exile Days Napolean Called Back from Exile Days and France is Great and the Rest of the World is Rubbish Days Conclusion France enjoys a rich history a picturesque and varied landscape and a temperate climate In short it would be a very nice country if it was not inhabited by French peopleThe best thing that can be said for France is that it is not Germany

Richard nron cc Subject Dave Barrys thoughts on CAs electrical storage Rick thought you might enjoy this alternative theory on the root cause of Cals problem Ray Forwarded by Ray AlvarezTRANSREDES on AM Steve Hopper AM To Ricky Lynn nron John nron Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Peter E nron Ray RANSREDES Doug RANSREDES cc Subject Dave Barrys thoughts on CAs electrical storage Feb PM The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite By DAVE BARRY When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California our reaction as concerned Americans is Ha ha No seriously we are alarmed Because history teaches us that whatever happens to California smog road rage tofu coffee that is mainly air cell phones the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive Shirley MacLaine people taking inline skating seriously grandmothers sporting new and flagrantly inappropriate bosoms eventually happens to the rest of the nation Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage and see if we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and change the subject Our first question is What exactly is electricity When we look in our Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia we see that electricity is defined as a class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge and from the interaction of charges What does this mean in laypersons terms It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big fat dope Because we know from our juniorhighschool science training that electricity is actually a fastmoving herd of electrons which are tiny onecelled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside a doubleA battery where they die within minutes Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited This was proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during a thunderstorm and was almost killed Encouraged by this success Franklin went on to conduct many more electrical experiments including rolling a hoop in a thunderstorm playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing somersaults in a thunderstorm Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm leaving the authorities with no choice but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France Nevertheless Franklin had proved an important scientific point which is that electricity originates inside clouds There it forms into lightning which is attracted to the earth by golfers After entering the ground the electricity hardens into coal which when dug up by power companies and burned in big ovens called generators turns back into electricity which is sent in the form of volts also known as watts or rpm for short through special wires with birds sitting on them to consumers homes where it is transformed by TV sets into commercials for beer which passes through the consumers and back into the ground thus completing what is known as a circuit But enough technical talk The problem is that California is running out of electricity The situation is so bad that in some hospitals they dont have enough electricity to power those electricshock paddles that get peoples hearts started again instead the doctors and nurses have to hold hands scuff their feet across the carpet in unison then shout CLEAR as they touch the patients chest Who is responsible for Californias electricity shortage You could blame the power companies or you could blame environmental wackos or you could blame the entertainment industry which uses more than billion watts of electricity per day just to blowdry the hair of the cast of Dawsons Creek or you could blame why not the Firestone tire company But you would be wrong Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity shortage is college students I base this statement on widespread observation of my son who is a college student and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium If my son is in a room then every electrical device within yards of that room every light computer television stereo video game microwave oven etc will be running My son doesnt even have to turn the devices on they activate themselves spontaneously in response to his presence Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in California which according to my research is EDITOR Please insert number of college students in California and you see my point which is EDITOR Please insert my point The question is What can the rest of us do to help our fellow countrypersons in California The answer is that we can send them our spare electricity Just imagine what would happen if all the households in this great and generous nation got out their extension cords and connected them together forming a giant electrical chain of helping across the fruited plain to the Golden State Millions of people would be turned into generous smoking lumps of carbon thats what So maybe we should go with Plan B This involves building a really really really big kite KnightRidder Tribune

and with the initial severance process completed it seemed an appropriate time to e ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future Before I turn to the organizational changes I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance youll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart Leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegeI am thankful for every day that I have had that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re sponsibility This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat ed group of professionals and support staff and who to a person are also very decent and good people To say goodbye to some of our colleagues is not easy I want to on behalf of all of us thank them for their hard wor k their integrity their decency and the good times and laughter that we shared I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done As to the organizational structure it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines particularly within the US has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times The nee d to rationalize the organizational structure in order to consolidate all US energy functions is a strong need from my perspective As a result Jim Steffes will lead the US Energy group along with Sue Nord who will j ointly report to Jim and myself Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h elp Jim shoulder a significant burden Also reporting to Jim will be a lea dership group for US Energy that will be as follows Wholesale Electrici ty will be led by Christi Nicolay Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will be led by Harry Kingerski Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner La st but not least Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara who will continue to focus o n California energy issues will report to Jim Sue Mara will also be part of the Wholesale electricity team Steve Montovano who will continue to report to me will lead a commercial development effort along with Dan Allegretti With the elimination of the regional groups I also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our politicalleg islative needs across the US Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w ill address that need and that will focus on state political support Paul will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev elopment efforts across the US Much of the rest of the group remains the same Linda Robertson will conti nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel who reports to Linda taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC Amr Ibrahi m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function Maggy Huson will take over su pport of the nonenergy business units which are as follows Global Market s Industrial Markets Networks and Broadband Rob Hemstock will continue to lead the support of Enron Canada Paul Dawson who heads up government affairs for Europe Sergio Assad who heads up government affairs for Sout h America and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther who head up our Asian efforts will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company That Comm ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock Maggy Huson Amr Ibrahim Paul Kaufman Harry Kingerski Leslie Lawner Steve Montovano Christi Nicolay Sue Nord Sarah Novosel Linda Robertson Jim Steffes and myself We will also con tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson Harry King erski Sue Nord Linda Robertson Jim Steffes myself Finally I am form ing a DynegyEnron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of Jose Bestard Paul Dawson Paul Kaufman Sue Nord Sarah Novosel and myself No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf ect or permanent I believe these changes will make us better and more pre pared for the future However we must be prepared to further adjust as th e future unfolds for the company One final note I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company We are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr oup fundamentally altered but we must resolve to do our best for each othe r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges f or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy reflects the excelle nce and integrity that has characterized our group Personally I will do all I can for as long as I can to steer the group through this to the ver y best place possible Your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated Hang in there and thanks

James D ES Richard ES cc Joe nron Sarah nron Charles CT Richard CT Subject Joes group accomplishments in SO FAR Per Jims request for the database I dont know if you want to put the values that Kevin is giving into the database Completed the negotiations and FERC filing of the Next Hour Market scheduling proposal When implemented scheduled for June this will provide one stop shopping for next hour business Ties OASIS and TAGGING together into one request Also if a tranmission provider cuts the transmission the PSE only pays for his actual use versus what he originally scheduled This will speed up the ability to schedule the next hour nonfirm This order is an important recognition by FERC that its OATT did not cover hourly which we complained about alot at FERCs hotline last summer Successful in obtaining the release of all ISN system information to marketers in the WSCC region This was an individual effort by Dick that h as been benificial for our traders in the WEST Successfully prevented the WS CC Operating Committee from taking action that would have reversed this effort Assisted in getting the initial control areas in SERC approved last ye ar and preventing ATC changes this year and OC changes that would have negated the Control Area effort Dick served as Co CHAIR of the ISO committee that put the SPP contract in place that eliminated MW mile pricing in SPP and will serve as the basis for SPPs RTO Dick was appointed to the NERC Control Area Task Force which was formed as a result of our the success of the Enron Control Areas in TVA and have s o far been successful in keeping this effort so that it is non punitive Thi s has turned into a very positive process that may result in a new configuration of the NERC relibiability effort Dicks made comments to ENTERGY that helped push Entergy into filing their new scheduling procedure ultimate source and sink with FERC This was initially going to be implemented unilaterally March without a FERC filing and Enron would have been forced into an after the fact complaint situation at FERC where we are not allowed to get damages that we would hav e incurred in the meantime See Comm Masseys concurrence in Aquila v Enter gy about the lack of incentive to file complaints Kevin Presto said that winning the protest at FERC due would be worth MM On TECO revised its proposed generator imbalance charge from minute by minute to hourly accountability notably TECO revised its propos al before FERC issued an order based on the EPSA protest herein We worked wi th EPSA to file an EPSA protest to TECOs proposal We didnt like TECO s proposal but had commercial concerns about filing a protest in our own name since Enron is working with TECO on a project We were able to get EPSA to protest this issue in TECOs initial filing Enron is planning to site generation in Florida but we dont have the value on this win yet FERC issued a NOPR on January proposing to revise the way it assesses annual charges to public utilities Enron along with several other participants Dynegy Koch APX Citizens NP Energy Sonat a nd Williams filed a petition for rulemaking with FERC in August requesting FERC to revise its methodology for assessing annual charges arguing that FERCs current system of assessing annual charges on sales for resale of power discourages trading impedes reliance on competitive market s for power and could create competitive advantages for utilities over new power marketers entering the market We proposed that FERC either assess i ts costs on transmission only or reallocate the amounts that it collects through sales transactions versus transmission transactions Although FERC does not grant our petition and in fact dismisses it as moot the petition served its purpose In the NOPR FERC notes that because most of its time is spent on transmission issues a point that we made in the Petition it is appropria te to assess costs only on the MWh of electric energy transmitted in interstat e commerce by public utilities Under the current assessment system FERC divides its costs between transmission and sales Now FERC is proposing to collect its costs solely through transmission FERC justifies this change because it spends most of its time on transmission issues and because transmission providers can collect the fees through transmission charges assessed to users of the grid FERC proposes to asses its costs to unbundled wholesale transmission unbundled retail transmission and bundled wholesale power sales Bundled native load transactions will apparently avoid assessments of any FERCrelated costs however EPSA and Enron are protesting this issue at FERC Jim Steffes has been working on a calculation of additional value Interconnection Policy Utilizing EPSA efforts including Sarahs meeting with FERC we got the policy statement we urged FERC to put forth in the forum we suggested ie an existing proceeding in the Tennessee Powe r order where FERC said interconnection procedures should follow the pro form a tariff including that a generator doesnt have to request transmission and interconnection at the same time We worked with EPSA to draft the Model interconnection agreement that EPSA filed at FERC in the Entergy interconnection proposal AEPCSW order approved the merger but accepted intervenors testimony showing market power and conditioned merger on an independent calculation of ATC postings which we proposed and independent market monitor soon after the merger occurs with RTO participation by Kevin Presto said the independent ATC calculation is worth MM to Enron Note we are going to propose MAIN instead of SPP which AEP chose Kev in said that AEPs ATC calculation can trump all interfaces in ECAR so this h as a positive effect not just on AEP but on all of ECAR MAPP FERC further order on refunds MAPP refused to refund moni es that it was unable to collect from a nonjurisdictional member transmission owner NPPD EPMI filed a protest to MAPPs refund report arguing that MAPP was ordered to make full refunds and it violated that order FERC agreed with Enron and rejected MAPPs refund report FERC said MAPP must refun d the full amount to transmission customers whether or not it was able to collec t that money from NPPD Results in another of refunds for EPMI Sarah is working on the PGE sale

Approved Excellent and congratulations Ray Alvarez PM To Steven J nron Richard nron Linda NRON James D nron cc Harry nron Robert NeustaedterENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Tariffs Approved The rate case that the governmental affairs group filed in January on behalf of Transredes has come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates will go into effect towards the end of this month The rates are not much lower than what we filed for and represent a very significant increase over the previous rates The tariff methodology and revised regulations put into effect by the Supreme Decree were followed to the letter by the regulator despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down The deliverables here were to obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would make the company financeable rescue it from dire financial straits and file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the tariff methodology This second deliverable has now been completed Transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the uncertainty about rates it is my understanding that the financial market loved the ruling and that Transredes sold million worth of bonds in about minutes This ruling should also significantly increase Transredess market value relative to Enrons efforts to sell its interest in the company Forwarded by Ray AlvarezNAEnron on AM Doug Farmer PM To Peter E WeidlerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Jan van den RANSREDES John RANSREDES Cyro RANSREDES Pedro RANSREDES Fernando RANSREDES Subject Tariffs Approved Gentlemen I am delighted to report that SIRESE approved substantial increases in TRs tariffs consistent with the Law and Regulation The details are Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved Increase TRCLHB Proposed TRCLHB Increase Gas Export including surcharges excluding RG Liquids Domestic Liquids Export CLHBs tariffs were also approved as follows As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB comparable with our liquids domestic We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach their conclusions on Monday but our inteligence suggests the following Export gas volumes increased to TR capacity and GSA Cuiaba assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes RG Compresion project deleted Interest rate reduced to or ie the rate in our bond issue Liquids expansion in the South reduced Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between concesions OCC in service date slipped from to DebtEquity assumption changed from to Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows Volumes Covered by rule we can blete but can expect little back here Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the short term ie RG Compression not worth fighting for since we dont even have the support of BG Interest Rate Well get this back when we do a tariff revision and actual rates are used When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we have concrete grounds ie commision costs etc are omited Liquids Expansion in the South Here we intend to do a detailed analysis of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquidsgas production will be shut in If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected producers PB BG Vintage and Chaco We will then write to those producerscopy SIRESE VMEH etc stating that on their recommendation the project scope was reduced by SIRESE We will give them an estimate of the lost liquidsgas production in both volume and cash terms resultant from this decision We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal Continuity of Service Capex We need to see the detail here We will take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared to compromise our safety and environmental standards We need to see exactly what has been removed but my thought is that if that means we are unable to provide some services eg LPG transportation or the continued operation of some liquids laterals we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the decision Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the SIRESE budget process OPEX need to see the detail on Monday OCC will not appeal we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC strategy DebtEquity ratio Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance with the LawRegulation the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is However we have very strong grounds to appeal since a we are currently miles away from let alone b we can only borrow for CAPEX as per bond issue and the policy of allmost bankslending institutions with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from We intend to fight this one very hard using all the externalindependant help we can get As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut This has not happened SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases Having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much smaller and hence managable increases Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume assumptions ie the worst case Regards Doug

contracts as currently w ritten are within the rules as approved by the Commission Until the utilit ies move to amend the relevant rules the Commission can only exercise its displeasure by appropriate oversight and enforcement to determine what cond uct amounts to abuse and gaming I think it will ultimately be a question o f degree and pattern of switching The onus will be on the affiliated REPs to prove abuse and gaming Fundamentally it is in the best interest of the market to allow customers to come and go Customer mobility is the best cu stomer protection in a competitive market Besides a

Furnas to cover the situation where the commissioning plan did not go as scheduled It was signed early afternoon and sent to Eletrobras The Eletrobras Diretoria had not followed this issue closely and need legal clearance Furnas and the Ministry Perazzo called to give it priority Late at night we received word that the parecer opinion was ready and that it the Anex would signed by Eletrobras next Monday and entered into their Board meeting next Tuesday Petrobras sent us the letter we asked but took out of their version a key word only Only refers that they will not go after us for nonpayment if Furnas does not pay In the letter they also stated that they will commence the loading operation at their own risk Saturday This was requested by Perazzo to save logistical time because it takes three days to get to Cuiaba from the refinery Advised Laine of the situation to check Monday how many trucks were loaded and in transit We contacted Perazzo through Sergio Assad to get his word that there would not be a last minute hitch otherwise we may have to refuse to take the diesel and would create a BIG PR problem for all Topic III Consent Package Opinions Aditivo Consent Furnas came in with the list of issues they wanted to discuss I instead insisted that we treat this meeting as a continuation of the MME meeting and follow the Agenda by looking at the Consent document package actually go over the text that they find objectionable and if it the text had a direct link with any of their issues we would discuss and examine the relative positions What they told me is what they have told me before that some of the issues have nothing to do with the Consent but they want it as a condition to agree to the package Which is fine to me because it will make it clear to the government what we have been saying they want to change the deal In Furnas defense I need to add that they feel they have been handed a bad contract and they want regulatory relief which it has been granted on a casebycase basis in other deals So part of their strategy is to force MME or Aneel to provide some tariff relief I asked them to list out the key issues with the Consent Old a the days additional time Furnas b The guarantee substitution at the time of privatization c the lenders involvement on contract changes we do not want to go to Washington to negotiate Newer d giving up their right to ask Aneel to homologar ratify rather than registrar contract changes big risk for us I believe the have more direct issues We go back to Rio Monday another holiday down the drain and Tuesday

BestardENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Jose Bestard PM To Cuiaba LT cc Sergio nron Orlando nron Joe nron Subject Cuiaba Issues July situation Topic I Amendment We spent the morning perfecting Aditivo with Furnas to cover the situation where the commissioning plan did not go as scheduled It was signed early afternoon and sent to Eletrobras The Eletrobras Diretoria had not followed this issue closely and need legal clearance Furnas and the Ministry Perazzo called to give it priority Late at night we received word that the parecer opinion was ready and that it the Anex would signed by Eletrobras next Monday and entered into their Board meeting next Tuesday Petrobras sent us the letter we asked but took out of their version a key word only Only refers that they will not go after us for nonpayment if Furnas does not pay In the letter they also stated that they will commence the loading operation at their own risk Saturday This was requested by Perazzo to save logistical time because it takes three days to get to Cuiaba from the refinery Advised Laine of the situation to check Monday how many trucks were loaded and in transit We contacted Perazzo through Sergio Assad to get his word that there would not be a last minute hitch otherwise we may have to refuse to take the diesel and would create a BIG PR problem for all Topic III Consent Package Opinions Aditivo Consent Furnas came in with the list of issues they wanted to discuss I instead insisted that we treat this meeting as a continuation of the MME meeting and follow the Agenda by looking at the Consent document package actually go over the text that they find objectionable and if it the text had a direct link with any of their issues we would discuss and examine the relative positions What they told me is what they have told me before that some of the issues have nothing to do with the Consent but they want it as a condition to agree to the package Which is fine to me because it will make it clear to the government what we have been saying they want to change the deal In Furnas defense I need to add that they feel they have been handed a bad contract and they want regulatory relief which it has been granted on a casebycase basis in other deals So part of their strategy is to force MME or Aneel to provide some tariff relief I asked them to list out the key issues with the Consent Old a the days additional time Furnas b The guarantee substitution at the time of privatization c the lenders involvement on contract changes we do not want to go to Washington to negotiate Newer d giving up their right to ask Aneel to homologar ratify rather than registrar contract changes big risk for us I believe the have more direct issues We go back to Rio Monday another holiday down the drain and Tuesday

AM To Richard NRON cc Subject Re Energy Services CoaltionVisit To London Friday December I guess because of the way the message was sent to me I cannot include text in return but responding to your question of what does Joes last comment mean presumably it is that on these issues of WTO I am not competent to advise you on them Leaving that aside I further suspect that he sees me as the bette noir of the WTO ESC effort Finally you might talk to Tom Briggs I think Joe has stood Toms position on its head Joe has argued that we need to be in the ESC because other things we care about like financial services regulation and ecommerce will be implicated He says Tom argues that we must liberalise energy to realise these objectives As I understand Tom and he can speak for himself if we do not get energy services liberalised and the exclusion of thirdparty access is tantamount to not getting energy services liberalised then the makeweight arguments about ecommerce and financial services fall away at least as propsarguments for continuing the ESC talk to you later today mcs Forwarded by Richard ShapiroNAEnron on AM Mark CT AM To Richard nron cc Subject RE Energy Services I had shared

Schroeder To Steven J nron Richard nron cc Subject RE Energy Services Tom Briggs was good enough to forward to me a piece of correspondence that Joe Hillings apparently shared with him My lack of enthusiasm for our WTO initiative I know has hardly been masked but frankly what is contained in the incoming letter below I find quite disconcerting I have argued that in our key markets eg Europe Japan etc I am assuming we do not need it in the USA even today the WTO initiative ie liberalisation of energy siervices would be of little value by the time it was implemented I had apparently mistakenly at least assumed that liberalisation of energy siervices at a minimum meant thirdparty access to transmission networks If not then what the heck are we doing in this fight BUT as you will see from the incoming below when Paul Hennemeyer of my team here in London joined Joe and Bob Fisher in Geneva to do a presentation on liberalisation of energy services in WTO it provoked a letter to which Joe responded saying that the US Energy Services Coalition has NEVER taken a position on thrid party access and it is doubtful they could agree to such a position Joe agreed and said this was just an Enron company position You can probably guess my position on this but I thought I would forward this to you for your information and if warranted follow up as the conversations we have had have never led me to believe that either of you thought we were pursuing a WTO initiative which did NOT involve third party access thanks mcs Forwarded by Mark SchroederLONECT on From Tom NRON on CST

fax email Brian Thank you for your thoughtful and complete statement of the issue The ESC has not taken any position on the regulatory details of market access nor advocated any such as Third Party Access although Enron certainly has taken a public position at the EU and other venues preferring TPA but willing to be practical about the issue I greatly appreciate your cutting through to the concern It is helpful and hopefully will help us in future presentations I know it will help me Regards Joe Raggett Brian AM To cc Arscott Lyn Subject RE Energy Services Joe Having raised the matter covered by the exchange of emails between yourself and Lyn I feel I should clarify my observations of the meeting at the WTO I am confident that the WTO representatives were better informed and enlightened by the presentations given by the ESC I am sure they were also struck as was I by Pauls enthusiastic explanation of the range of innovative energy services offered by Enron What sparked my concern was the reference to access to energy networks Personally I do not and more importantly nor does OGP take a position on TPA in the EU to which you refer in your communication Even more so in the context of the WTO because it has never been discussed I surmise though that other ESC members would have similar reservations My concerns were heightened by questions on the subject raised by one or two of our interlocutors This part of the discussion then broadened somewhat and included information about a court case in Germany to overcome entrenched opposition to TPA by certain network operators I know not whom I believe it would be a pity if the broader aspects of energy services supported generally by the ESC became subsumed by a debate on TPA to either nationally or privately owned networks to which some WTO governments outside Europe and the United States maybe opposed While I detected concerns about this in the questions asked I dont think that the baby was thrown away with the bathwater It is my view however that the ESC should be cautious about raising an issue which some governments may perceive to be outside what they think is a more reasonable agenda and to which rightly or wrongly they have antipathy My concern is that this may then be used to forestall the worthy and perhaps more achievable objectives of the ESC to include the wide range of services advocated in the main by Paul and by the others who presented I most certainly have a positive view on the value of your work and I hope this helps I am not sure at this point whether I will be

grateful if you could select the restaurant Should another time be more convenient with you please let me know From your response regarding the comment in Geneva I am not feeling that I addressed the specifics of your concern so at the risk of prolonging the pain Ill make another stab at a response If the concern centers on liberalization of transmission access for electricity and natural gas I would respond that we want to see the EU electricity and natural gas directives fully implemented The EU had asked member countries to fully implement transmission access and it is being accomplished in a phased in approach Some member countries are doing it in a way that makes energy services possible some to a less degree and so far France has not adopted the implementing legislation which is a subject of concern to the EU The opening up of markets to the maximum degree possible is a broad goal of the Energy Services Coalition recognizing that this is a position that has to be negotiated We have not recommended any specific regulatory system or regime If I am still missing your concern please bear with me and bring me in closer to any concern that you may have Regards and best wishes Joe

market clea ring price will not be subject to refund liability Although the followin g qualification is made However all public utility rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on marketbased rates discussed infra Presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavio r In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price th e generator must within

purchases or po rtfolio with no opportunity cost Underscheduling Penalites FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it is still in place Thus although it may be advantageous to wait to buy p ower in RT at capped prices doing so may make the scheduling coordinator subject to the currently effective MWh penalty See p of

without an input cost basis or bidding not based on un it behavior An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently b e inappropriate In addition hockey stick bids are expressly prohibited ie bidding at marginal cost and at a much higher level Other prohibited bidding practices identified include pricing a single unit muc h higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in

November PM ToShapiro Richard SubjectGovernment Affairs Organization Announcement With the announcement of Enrons acquisition by Dynegy behind us and with the initial severance process completed it seemed an appropriate time to e ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future Before I turn to the organizational changes I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance youll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart Leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegeI am thankful for every day that I have had that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re sponsibility This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat ed group of professionals and support staff and who to a person are also very decent and good people To say goodbye to some of our colleagues is not easy I want to on behalf of all of us thank them for their hard wor k their integrity their decency and the good times and laughter that we shared I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done As to the organizational structure it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines particularly within the US has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times The nee d to rationalize the organizational structure in order to consolidate all US energy functions is a strong need from my perspective As a result Jim Steffes will lead the US Energy group along with Sue Nord who will j ointly report to Jim and myself Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h elp Jim shoulder a significant burden Also reporting to Jim will be a lea dership group for US Energy that will be as follows Wholesale Electrici

continue to focus o n California energy issues will report to Jim Sue Mara will also be part of the Wholesale electricity team Steve Montovano who will continue to report to me will lead a commercial development effort along with Dan Allegretti With the elimination of the regional groups I also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our politicalleg islative needs across the US Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w ill address that need and that will focus on state political support Paul will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev elopment efforts across the US Much of the rest of the group remains the same Linda Robertson will conti nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel who reports to Linda taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC Amr Ibrahi m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function Maggy Huson will take over su pport of the nonenergy business units which are as follows Global Market s Industrial Markets Networks and Broadband Rob Hemstock will continue to lead the support of Enron Canada Paul Dawson who heads up government affairs for Europe Sergio Assad who heads up government affairs for Sout h America and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther who head up our Asian efforts will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company That Comm ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock Maggy Huson Amr Ibrahim Paul Kaufman Harry Kingerski Leslie Lawner Steve Montovano Christi Nicolay Sue Nord Sarah Novosel Linda Robertson Jim Steffes and

permanent I believe these changes will make us better and more pre pared for the future However we must be prepared to further adjust as th e future unfolds for the company One final note I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company We are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr oup fundamentally altered but we must resolve to do our best for each othe r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges f or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy

West are to be married The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can heal its wounds Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by or possibly not sure of date Otherwise the utility will lose marketbased rates will be unable to get a merger approved and will have its transmission rev req scrutinized The commission favors market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure The goal is to essentially reissue the Order tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation Although California will be allowed to heal it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates Further summary prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt Affairs DC office is provided bel o w The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues The following is a summary of the meeting The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks organizational what will the RTO organizations look like and substantive once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort The Commission will initiate a section proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the functions established in Order No into RTO structures To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No transmission tariff The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December with a declaration to join an RTO If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October RTO Workshops End of October further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmissionowners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers Realizing that there are many positions on this topic Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process Sorry this is so long but a lot happened today We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over Let us know if you have any questions Sarah

report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast P ower Grid platform that resulted from the mediation JUDGES FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS FERC should consider adoption of Grid Mo del the one Enron likes best to fullest extent possible and that remainin g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process Ho wever since complete consensus was not reached FERC should provide its de termination of which of the two models best meets FERCs expectations as a platform for the SE Power Grid RTO This should be done by FERC quickly There should be no further delay Regardless of the model FERC should enc ourage the collaborative process She thinks that this should be done by t he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER C orders I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down Parties should reconvene within days after FERCs order adopting a m odel and the FERC order should direct the participants like us to submit a joint proposal within days thereafter She recommends to FERC that pa rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within days however she reco mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process The Commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations may reject he r recommendations or change something I would expect that the Commission would adopt many of her recommendations while allowing further mediatedt ype discussions on some issues hopefully FERC will adopt many of our sugg ested changes Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of the Grid Group and the Southern etal group then provides the stakeholde r participants comments almost verbatim from all submissions to her Wh ile

will include our proposed cha nges to the documents Highlights from her report below She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr ocess which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input r egardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC Her opinion is that the Grid Entergy GridSouth and GridFlorida utility s ponsored Model transco in RTO LMPfinancial rights congestion managemen t is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of Order No based on a best practices analysis of other RTOs and C ommission precedent This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid model However she does provide the Commission information on Southern et als proposal independent system administratorlike National Gridtype in her report even though she has concerns that the Southern etal model i s not Order No compliant The Southern etal model has a hybrid phy sical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a nd LMP in real time with penalties and significant control area responsib ilities The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below Grid Governance RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement the Independent Market Administrator IMA The IMA was a dded to facilitate public power participation worried that transmission ow ner on top even if divested from generation would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution The IMA would a dminister the markets exercise operational authority over the transmission system administer one OASIS with one process for interconnection and tra nsmission requests and assume the Security Coordinator function She str ongly encourages this split Good stakeholder advisory Committee provides majority and minority views and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets Allows for Independent Transmission Companies Entergy wants to be one wi th RTO oversight Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation such as switching transmission elements pur suant to operating procedures approved by the RTOIMA Recognizes that con solidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures Protocols should be subject to

RTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC RTOtransco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process Numerous comments from marketers IPPs on reduction of control area functio ns all of our comments from last weeks response are included Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners Many a re still concerned that FERC had not conducted a costbenefit analysis an d had concerns over the costs She responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the economies of s cale and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure In any event FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions concerned about cost shiftin g mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo wed Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t ransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a ssets concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re tail open access concerns with Cal Judge encourages the Commission to u tilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant jump sta rt it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Jud ge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions Furthermore the in itial results after days show the majority of participants favoring a b est practices PJMSPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with L MP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent b oard structure that accommodates a forprofit RTO

Susan Maurer Luiz Philipp Meredith Cc Allegretti Daniel Hoatson Tom Fromer Howard Subject Northeast RTO Mediation Report Yesterday afternoon September the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the day mediation session Although not unexpected but still disappointing the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs This market design proposal encompasses a long drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like minimum months before work begins to develop the new RTO The target implementation date of the ISOs is November but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is subject to extension if new design requirements are introduced We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures A copy of the Judges report and the Business Plan are attached One good aspect of the Judges report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance We too believe this is necessary It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities or the New England ISO on market design or governance We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system with enhancements where possible Others relying on the ambiguity in FERCs orders argued that FERC really intended to create a new system using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs regardless of time or complication of creating this new market We need FERC direction on this and the Judge makes this clear Background The Judges primary goal of this day mediation process was simply to establish a business plan which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created Enron along with many other participants opposed this approach arguing that we are wasting the days given to us by the Commission The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly Although the majority of the Judges report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan he does discuss two substantive issues market design and governance Market Design At the beginning of the mediation PJM NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO This proposal envisions a timeintensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders with an implementation date in years Option Mof the Business Plan This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs PJM has its own approach see below The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in years Option M of the Business Plan PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single dayahead and realtime energy market by November Option M of the Business Plan We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers generators PJM TOs industrials and other end use customers The One RTO Coalition advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJMs system by December but no later than May Although we Enron believe PJMs November time frame is too conservative the coalition supports Option M PJMs approach since it achieves the Coalitions goals albeit on a slower timetable As noted above the Judge endorses Option M in part because it has a builtin a process for determining Best Practices Although PJM also conducted a best practices analysis the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJMs determinations of what practices from their ISOs are best practices The Judge acknowledges that support for Option M the PJM plan far outstrips the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support However the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM The Judge states that impatience haste and greed should not be permitted to drive the RTO process at the expense of sound policy and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint See Report page Governance The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance interim governance final governance board makeup and stakeholder process The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed instead he discusses the pros and cons of each option Here again the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commissions preferred governance approach The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November and certainly earlier PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs from PJM from New York and from New England The Board elects a voting CEO assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins NY ISO New England ISO NY PSC NY TOs and New England TOs along with other entities primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC all support equal representation on the new Board One proposal would have board members from each ISO with a nonvoting CEO The other proposal would have board members from each ISO with additional board members to be elected by stakeholders We support the PJM board makeup proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system Post Mediation The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment We are working on two sets of comments now one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a wellreasoned even

few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance youll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart Leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegeI am thankful for every day that I have had that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re sponsibility This sense of privilege and thankfulness

that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done As to the organizational structure it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines particularly within the US has impeded our ability to get

Analysis News item from Reuters Enron Corp NYSE ENE shares fell sharply in opening trade on No v after the humbled energy giant warned it could be forced to pay by ne xt week million in debt triggered by a credit downgrade last week The shares were down or percent to just over in early morni ng trade on the New York Stock Exchange The stock was the biggest loser by percentage change and the secondmost active stock on the NYSE As of earl y morning trading on Nov Enron shares were priced at reportedly their lowest level in nearly years Analysis To paraphrase Shakespea re Oh what a tangled web they weave when first they attempt to Wait I better stop When speaking about Enron I am not prepared to finish that s entence at least at this point Enron has been accused of a lot of things over the last few weeks but at this juncture an ongoing Securities and Exc hange Commission SEC investigation has yet to reach any conclusion regard ing deceptive financial reporting on the part of the Houston trader Enron itself has admitted that its financial records from through the first half of should not be relied upon Nevertheless perception is reali ty and the perception currently in the industry is that Enron is now taking a fall after getting caught following years of skirting the truth While n egative perception continues to cause damage to Enrons stock perhaps of m ore current interest are the developments that are more grounded in reality We know Enron has just lowered its thirdquarter earnings faces a stiff payment of million due within a week in fact and has cast doubt ove r its Q earnings potential The question of the hour is whether these new financial hits will represent a material adverse change in the eyes of Dy negy which still aims to buy Enron but wisely included an exit clause in i ts purchase contract The other question is what happens to Enron if Dyneg y leaves it standing at the altar A terminated marriage agreement would su rely cause further reductions to Enrons alreadyweak credit standing and it is unknown how the company could recover from another blow to its reputa tion As has been the case since the first of October the ongoing fall of Enron story is changing by the day For background on Dynegys proposed acquisition of Enron and Enrons financial problems that precipitated the proposal please see my IssueAlert available at wwwscientechc omrci File issuealertarticleaspidD In the interest of time let me summarize what is happening at this moment Dynegy rode in as Enrons white knight and plopped down a billio n offer a share to buy the company which at the time represented a s teal of a price considering that Enron was priced at almost a share lit tle more than a year ago To some extent this seemed like the final chapte r in the Enron saga In other words the company had gone through a tumultu ous year hit its rock bottom but still planned to live happily ever afte r as part of Dynegy Inc its muchsmaller rival The developments just this week amount to a screeching brake that may in fact interrupt the nupt ials between the two companies For starters on Monday Nov Enron su bmitted its Q report to the SEC which was five days late by the way In the report Enron dropped what have turned out to be several bombshells First Enron disclosed that due to recent downgrades of its credit rating by agencies such as Moodys Standard Poors and Fitch it has to pay of f or refinance by Nov debt it owes to a third party with which it has a partnership or face nearly billion in additional payments Enron also has the option of finding new collateral to guarantee the debt Enron would not disclose who owns the note but we know that the limited partnership i ncludes holdings in CEG Rio a Brazilian natural gascompany that Enron had planned to sell to raise about million in cash Note that just las t week various credit services lowered Enrons senior unsecured debt to on e notch above junk status and warned that further downgrades may occur whi ch apparently prompted the call for the debt payment Reportedly if Enron does not make the million payment by Nov investors will gain the right to immediately begin liquidating the asset for an amount equal to the note payable Enron is presently scrambling to establish a mutually accep table amendment with lenders to avoid having to issue payment on the debt Along with the acknowledgement of the imminent payment of million En ron said that any further drop in its credit rating might necessitate furth er payments of billion to other partnerships the bulk of that figure going to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust Also in the new SEC filing Enron increased its Q loss by cents a share to cents Enron or iginally reported a Q loss of million but has now raised that figure to million As a minor bright side Enron did increase reported earni ngs for the first nine months of by a penny to cents a share attri buted to adjustments made after the quarters end However looking forward Enron warned that continuing credit worries and a decline in the value of some of its assets could take a further toll on fourthquarter earnings E nron also claims that even still the numbers contained in the Q report are not necessarily final as they have not been reviewed by Arthur Anderse n the companys external auditor Thus further revision of the numbers co uld take place Interestingly there does not seem to be a big question about whether or not Enron can pay the million debt obligation Enron apparently has secured an additional billion in loans from JP Morgan C hase and Citigroup in the last week In fact within the current SEC filing Enron says that is has billion of domestic cash consisting of the li nes of credit and net collections Thus some investors are reassured by th e belief that Enron has the cash on hand to make the million payment i f it is unable to renegotiate terms with lenders According to the SEC fili ng Enron also intends to sell off billion in noncore businesses that a re performing below acceptable rates and would use the proceeds to pay of f debts although this money would probably not be immediately available Again however there is a perception element to this development that sho uld be noted Enron has been accused of financing partnerships in the past in such a way as to keep them off the companys balance sheets Apparently this nondisclosure was done so that Enron could grow quickly without addi ng too much debt to its own books or diluting the value of its stock As ha s been well documented Enron is already in the midst of an intense SEC inv estigation regarding potential conflictofissues involving its former CFO News about other financial deals that may not have been fully disclosed is clearly making investors even more nervous about Enrons stock As I s aid the question of the hour is whether or not Enrons new problems will c ause Dynegy to reconsider its offer As usual the answer all depends on wh o you ask Dynegy is remaining mum and referring all questions about Enron s financial status to Enron Investors are rather mixed on the question So me say that the facts disclosed in the Q report do not dramatically chan ge Enrons position from what it was when Dynegy launched its acquisition a nd that the current drop in Enrons stock is just a kneejerk response to t he media hype surrounding the story Further those who diminish any potent ial impact say that Enron is still a liquid company and has money coming in from various sources Thus it should have no trouble making the mill ion payment From a broad perspective so one theory goes Dynegy is still getting a great deal in Enron due to its staggering drop in stock price an d the acquisition remains valuable to Dynegy as it will position the combin ed company as North Americas biggest marketer and trader of natural gas an d electricity In contrast other investors point to the fact that since the purchase agreement was signed Enrons stock has fallen an additional percent which weakens the original acquisition agreement In addition if Enron follows through with the million payment next week or secure s additional financing to front this cost both options alter the companys financial position from when Dynegy made its original offer which could b e construed as a material adverse change Another interesting developme nt indicates that Enron may no longer be the company that Dynegy agreed to purchase New reports indicate many energy trading companies are now unwill ing to sell power or natural gas to Enron for fear about the companys cred it concerns Such companies are now particularly reticent to sell power to Enron for nextday delivery What this means in practical terms is that oth er trading companies may be gaining Enrons market share which could dimin ish the value in the trading market that had attracted Dynegy to Enron in t he first place In addition Enrons oncestellar energy trading business c ould now become reduced or collapse altogether Questions have been raise d why Dynegy is not doing more at this time to help Enron out of its financ ial mess Of course under the acquisition agreement Dynegy already committ ed to providing an immediate billion assetbacked equity infusion into Enron to help the company with its current financial woes which will be f ollowed by an additional infusion of billion into the combined company by ChevronTexaco which owns percent of Dynegy However some traders a pparently have wondered why Dynegy has not done anything about Enrons dimi nishing ability to secure power on the open market Traders claim that Dyne gy could step in and buy power from sellers on the behalf of Enron in a st rategy known as sleeving The fact that Dynegy has not chosen to take thi s step has been an indication to some observers that it is only willing to go so far in its pursuit of Enron In addition Enron shareholders launch ed a lawsuit on Nov in state court in Houston to prevent the merger wit h Dynegy from happening The petition reportedly alleges that Enron directo rs breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell the company at too l ow a price and without adequate consideration of other alternatives Enron said it will defend its decision in court Moreover Dynegy was smart to include an exit clause in the acquisition agreement The clause reportedly allows Dynegy to walk away from Enron if any material adverse change occur s related to the outcome of the SEC investigation possible litigation agai nst Enron balance sheet strengths and earnings forecasts Certainly the l atest developments disclosed in Enrons Q filing with the SEC impact the companys balance sheet strengths and earnings forecasts so a case could be made that Dynegy would have grounds to terminate the acquisition Clearl y this pending deal hinges on the developments that will take place over t he next few weeks Dynegy ultimately will have to weigh the pros and cons o f its acquisition offer for Enron and determine if the oncegolden company still represents a great deal or if pursuing the purchase would cause more trouble than it is worth An archive

believe quite firmly that what we do in life and how we do it echoes through eternityit is the effort and the quality of the effort in all t hat we do in our lives that both matters and echoesWhile we engage in wo rk that cannot be equated with the work of people past and present such a s Mother Teresa the work we do is good very good in fact and makes a sig nificant difference to the Enron employees and their familiesEach of you in the context of the broad campaign to communicate the rightnes s of our perspective and to protect the good name of the company and indivi duals within the company has put forth a great effort that has been perfor med with excellence and that has made a significant and positive difference and that has succeeded in many respects thus farI understand the

and papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to address over the next few months These issues are extremely important to Enron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve most of these issues for many years There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it is ready to act and we need to be ready to respond In an effort to coordinate our efforts we have developed coverage teams to respond to these FERC initiatives The Washington advocacy group will also work closely with all of these teams If someone is interested in a particular issue and was not included on that team please feel free to call the Project Lead to have your name added to the team All assistance is welcome As you will see on the attached chart many of the deadlines for responding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks so the teams need to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly On the attached chart we have listed in the left column each of the FERC initiatives that will be starting or are currently underway A Project Lead has been named for each initiative The Project Lead will be responsible for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in the proceeding The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the next couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward The team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues should be addressed what is the best way for Enron to respond to them and producing draft comments Once draft comments are prepared the comments will be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enrons important issues There is a column of Inside Counsel and Outside Services In some areas we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not Where we do not list outside counsel we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments with significant input from the team members Please remember however that even if outside services are listed the RCR process must still be followed If applicable Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lead named for each proceeding RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October and we hope to have an executive from Enron make a presentation on one of the panels Comments will be submitted to FERC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs This team will also be responsible for these comments Standards of Conduct NOPR Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead Comments are due in approximately days Several issues are raised in this proceeding including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utilitys marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal ICAP Inquiry Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements whether they are needed and what impact such requirements have on the market Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed We will submit expert testimony on this issue California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation Alan Comnes will be the Project Lead Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible Furthermore a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California Californias summer peaking season is over but the Pacific Northwests winter peaking season will be starting soon and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest where it will be needed this winter This team will be responsible for both of these proceedings Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues Steve Walton is the Project Lead FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints Californias Path and the Central East Interface in New York and plans to have the study completed later this year The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it In a relating proceeding the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues The team will also oversee the progress in these proceedings Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements Susan Lindberg is the Project Lead The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market participants to provide more information than is currently required including at least seven additional data points per transaction This will have a significant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information Comments are due on October California Refund Proceeding Ray Alvarez is the Project Lead The Commission has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the California ISO from October through June and has established a hearing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding Bob Frank is the Project Lead The Judge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that refunds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest Briefs will be filed in response to the decision and the Commission will review the Judges order MidwestAlliance RTO Proceeding Mike Roan is the Project Lead Various filings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTOs in the Midwest the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO Enron is advocating consistent with the Commissions recent pronouncements one single RTO in the Midwest The Commission is expected to act on these filings shortly Proceedings may be ordered Northeast RTO Proceeding Sarah Novosel is the Project Lead Mediation to create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judges report is pending before the Commission A Commission order is expected on or before October Additional proceedings may be ordered Southeast RTO Proceeding Christi Nicolay is the Project Lead Mediation to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judges report is pending before the Commission A Commission order is expected on or before October Additional proceedings may be ordered

two in the morning They have almost no experience dealing with security either cyber or otherwise They are using the terrorist attacks on the th as a reason to blow the dust off all their old YK contingency plans and cash in on peoples fears to strengthen their position In any case I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC Look at NERCs offices They are in a shopping mall How secure is that Last time I visited they didnt even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything the whole place was wide open Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERCs infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers Contrast that with places like ISONE and NYISO who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex Or compare that with the MISOs hardened facility capable of withstanding an F tornado hit You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more secure Dave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous Thats akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider a terrorist isnt going to attack a tariff desk market system or security coordinator they will attack nuclear units substations and other installations that actually matter I echo Daves question do we want to call NERC on this issue It would be a very simple exercise to point to NERCs many security failings including some initiatives they are currently sitting on Bringing up the right details in the right forums could really undermine their reputation and nip this positioning in the bud By the way am I the only one who got a kick out of that article pointing out this rd grade cleverness of NIMDA is ADMIN spelled backwards Gotta love journalists always trying to

Weiner Legislative Affairs Committee Chair Jim Steffes Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Donn Salvosa Manager of Government Affairs DATE September RE NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs The attached email in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press The statements concern NERCs view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERCs Four RTO policy set forth in its July th Order The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization particularly the possibility that NERCs responsibilities could be shifted to EISB Also attached is an article containing the views of RJ Rudden Associates Inc that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations Specifically NERC representatives informed the press that on September the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilitiesfrom an information administration standpoint They noted that this resulted in service denials although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much This event was attributed to the socalled NIMBA virus NERCs statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role theyve played not only in security matters but possibly other aspects pertaining to reliability standards They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERCs July th Order Moreover it is likely that NERC will argue that given its expertise and experience recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization EISB ill advised It is unclear what if any impact all this may have on RTO development the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Boards consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting However we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters Please

and papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to address over the next few months These issues are extremely important to Enron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve most of these issues for many years There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it is ready to act and we need to be ready to respond In an effort to coordinate our efforts we have developed coverage teams to respond to these FERC initiatives The Washington advocacy group will also work closely with all of these teams If someone is interested in a particular issue and was not included on that team please feel free to call the Project Lead to have your name added to the team All assistance is welcome As you will see on the attached chart many of the deadlines for responding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks so the teams need to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly On the attached chart we have listed in the left column each of the FERC initiatives that will be starting or are currently underway A Project Lead has been named for each initiative The Project Lead will be responsible for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in the proceeding The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the next couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward The team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues should be addressed what is the best way for Enron to respond to them and producing draft comments Once draft comments are prepared the comments will be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enrons important issues There is a column of Inside Counsel and Outside Services In some areas we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not Where we do not list outside counsel we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments with significant input from the team members Please remember however that even if outside services are listed the RCR process must still be followed If applicable Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lead named for each proceeding RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October and we hope to have an executive from Enron make a presentation on one of the panels Comments will be submitted to FERC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs This team will also be responsible for these comments Standards of Conduct NOPR Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead Comments are due in approximately days Several issues are raised in this proceeding including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utilitys marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal ICAP Inquiry Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements whether they are needed and what impact such requirements have on the market Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed We will submit expert testimony on this issue California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation Alan Comnes will be the Project Lead Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible Furthermore a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California Californias summer peaking season is over but the Pacific Northwests winter peaking season will be starting soon and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest where it will be needed this winter This team will be responsible for both of these proceedings Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues Steve Walton is the Project Lead FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints Californias Path and the Central East Interface in New York and plans to have the study completed later this year The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it In a relating proceeding the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues The team will also oversee the progress in these proceedings Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements Susan Lindberg is the Project Lead The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market participants to provide more information than is currently required including at least seven additional data points per transaction This will have a significant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information Comments are due on October California Refund Proceeding Ray Alvarez is the Project Lead The Commission has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the California ISO from October through June and has established a hearing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding Bob Frank is the Project Lead The Judge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that refunds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest Briefs will be filed in response to the decision and the Commission will review the Judges order MidwestAlliance RTO Proceeding Mike Roan is the Project Lead Various filings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTOs in the Midwest the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO Enron is advocating consistent with the Commissions recent pronouncements one single RTO in the Midwest The Commission is expected to act on these filings shortly

and with the initial severance process completed it seemed an appropriate time to e ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future Before I turn to the organizational changes I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance youll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart Leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegeI am thankful for every day that I have had that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re sponsibility This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat ed group of professionals and support staff and who to a person are also very decent and good people To say goodbye to some of our colleagues is not easy I want to on behalf of all of us thank them for their hard wor k their integrity their decency and the good times and laughter that we shared I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done As to the organizational structure it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines particularly within the US has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times The nee d to rationalize the organizational structure in order to consolidate all US energy functions is a strong need from my perspective As a result Jim Steffes will lead the US Energy group along with Sue Nord who will j ointly report to Jim and myself Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h elp Jim shoulder a significant burden Also reporting to Jim will be a lea dership group for US Energy that will be as follows Wholesale Electrici ty will be led by Christi Nicolay Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will be led by Harry Kingerski Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner La st but not least Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara who will continue to focus o n California energy issues will report to Jim Sue Mara will also be part of the Wholesale electricity team Steve Montovano who will continue to report to me will lead a commercial development effort along with Dan Allegretti With the elimination of the regional groups I also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our politicalleg islative needs across the US Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w ill address that need and that will focus on state political support Paul will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev elopment efforts across the US Much of the rest of the group remains the same Linda Robertson will conti nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel who reports to Linda taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC Amr Ibrahi m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function Maggy Huson will take over su pport of the nonenergy business units which are as follows Global Market s Industrial Markets Networks and Broadband Rob Hemstock will continue to lead the support of Enron Canada Paul Dawson who heads up government affairs for Europe Sergio Assad who heads up government affairs for Sout h America and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther who head up our Asian efforts will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company That Comm ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock Maggy Huson Amr Ibrahim Paul Kaufman Harry Kingerski Leslie Lawner Steve Montovano Christi Nicolay Sue Nord Sarah Novosel Linda Robertson Jim Steffes and myself We will also con tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson Harry King erski Sue Nord Linda Robertson Jim Steffes myself Finally I am form ing a DynegyEnron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of Jose Bestard Paul Dawson Paul Kaufman Sue Nord Sarah Novosel and myself No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf ect or permanent I believe these changes will make us better and more pre pared for the future However we must be prepared to further adjust as th e future unfolds for the company One final note I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company We are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr oup fundamentally altered but we must resolve to do our best for each othe r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges f or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy reflects the excelle nce and integrity that has characterized our group Personally I will do all I can for as long as I can to steer the group through this to the ver y best place possible Your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated Hang in there and thanks

<26868863.1075852348740.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,richard.shapiro@enron.com,2001-09-27 08:12:45,FW FERC Meeting SummaryFYI Todays FERC meeting was a big deal Some of the key actions are DSTAR and RTO West are to be married The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can heal its wounds Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by or possibly not sure of date Otherwise the utility will lose marketbased rates will be unable to get a merger approved and will have its transmission rev req scrutinized The commission favors market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure The goal is to essentially reissue the Order tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation Although California will be allowed to heal it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates Further summary prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt Affairs DC office is provided bel o w The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues The following is a summary of the meeting The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks organizational what will the RTO organizations look like and substantive once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort The Commission will initiate a section proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the functions established in Order No into RTO structures To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No transmission tariff The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December with a declaration to join an RTO If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October RTO Workshops End of October further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmissionowners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers Realizing that there are many positions on this topic Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process Sorry this is so long but a lot happened today We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over Let us know if you have any questions Sarah

appropriate time to e ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future Before I turn to the organizational changes I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance youll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart Leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegeI am thankful for every day that I have had that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re sponsibility This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat ed group of professionals and support staff and who to a person are also very decent and good people To say goodbye to some of our colleagues is not easy I want to on behalf of all of us thank them for their hard wor k their integrity their decency and the good times and laughter that we shared I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done As to the organizational structure it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines particularly within the US has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times The nee d to rationalize the organizational structure in order to consolidate all US energy functions is a strong need from my perspective As a result Jim Steffes will lead the US Energy group along with Sue Nord who will j ointly report to Jim and myself Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h elp Jim shoulder a significant burden Also reporting to Jim will be a lea dership group for US Energy that will be as follows Wholesale Electrici ty will be led by

n California energy issues will report to Jim Sue Mara will also be part of the Wholesale electricity team Steve Montovano who will continue to report to me will lead a commercial development effort along with Dan Allegretti With the elimination of the regional groups I also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our politicalleg islative needs across the US Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w ill address that need and that will focus on state political support Paul will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev elopment efforts across the US Much of the rest of the group remains the same Linda Robertson will conti nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel who reports to Linda taking the lead role

heads up government affairs for Europe Sergio Assad who heads up government affairs for Sout h America and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther who head up our Asian efforts will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company That Comm ittee will consist

consist of Jose Bestard Paul Dawson Paul Kaufman Sue Nord Sarah Novosel and myself No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf ect or permanent I believe these changes will make us better and more pre pared for the future However we must be prepared to further adjust as th e future unfolds for the company One final note I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company We are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr oup fundamentally altered but we must resolve to do our best for each othe r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges f or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy reflects the excelle nce and

Mexico PNM shares some keys that have helped the small company find success in the wholesale power market He also looks at issues affecting deregulation both in New Mexico and across the country Read the questions Sterba was asked at wwwscientechcom IMAGE IMAGE April Deal for SCEs Transmission Assets Appears Dead on Arrival by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters California Gov Gray Davis billion dollar plan to save utility Southern California Edison SCE from bankruptcy is in deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators Legislative sources said the governor was having so much trouble gathering support for his plan that he could not find anyone to sponsor a bill One Assembly official called the SCE bailout plan the most unpopular piece of legislation in years Analysis Even when this deal was announced as an agreement in principle some days ago it seemed too farfetched to be possible The only party that clearly seems to benefit from the agreement forged between Gov Davis and SCE is the cashstrapped utility California energy customers appear to get the short end of an expensive stick while the state seemingly gains nothing of value beyond what could amount to a whole new set of administrative problems Thus despite the hype with which Gov Davis announced this rescue plan for SCE California legislatorsboth Republicans and Democratsare saying not so fast and appear to be collectively opposed to the plan as it currently stands As it becomes apparent that the California Legislature will not approve this plan the general consensus is that Gov Davis offer to SCE is simply a financial bailout for the utility that provides no benefit to California residents For background on the details of Gov Davis rescue plan for SCE please reference my IssueAlert from In a nutshell the state of California agreed to buy SCEs mile transmission grid which covers much of the southern half of the state for billion times the systems book value SCE would be allowed to use the proceeds to pay off its existing debt restoring it to financial stability Both the California Legislature and the CPUC need to approve this deal by Aug or else the agreement is terminated In the highly politicized climate under which the California energy crisis has unfolded it is imperative to understand the agendas that each stakeholder possesses For instance keep in mind that Gov Davis political career has been severely damaged by the states energy crisis and the fact that Pacific Gas Electric Co Californias largest utility company declared bankruptcy has only further tainted the governors standing Perhaps more than any other goal Davis wants to keep SCE from also filing for Chapter protection In addition Davis believes he will be better able to solve the crisis if he assumes control over the states transmission grid much like the state has assumed the role of a power purchasing agent Normally a measure supported by the Democratic governor could be easily approved by Californias Democratcontrolled legislature However the energy issue has divided support for Davis even within his own party Consequently the governor needs the support of both Republicans and Democrats in order to see his rescue plan for SCE pass For its part there was very little reason why SCE should not have agreed to the governors terms From multiple standpoints the utility gains enormously from the governors offer while at the same time it avoids lengthy and costly bankruptcy proceedings Under the agreement SCE gains a method for pulling itself out of debt via rate increases that probably would be implemented over the next years Further its parent company Edison International gets to hold on to a reported billion that SCE has provided to the corporate operation since The exception to this is a million tax refund that Edison International would give back to SCE While Davis referred to his plan as a good balanced deal some consumer groups have charged that SCE has taken the governor to the cleaners Meanwhile California customers clearly lose in the deal because they would be forced to ultimately pay for the billion that the state needs to buy the transmission assets The state would purchase the lines with bonds that would be paid off by transmission fees charged to SCE customers It is presently not clear whether or not those fees which are already part of monthly bills would be sufficient therefore it is likely that rates would be increased to support the purchase In addition the subtext of the deal is that customers would ultimately pay to drive down SCEs debt which was accumulated as a result of unrestricted wholesale power costs charged by generators Consequently California customers would bear the responsibility for prices that FERC has at times deemed unjust and unreasonable Ultimately however it is the California Legislature and CPUC that will have the authority to approve the agreement between Gov Davis and SCE These two agencies must ultimately decide if the plan is good or bad and weigh the impact for various stakeholders Presently the legislature in particular is finding that there are many questionable aspects about the plan For instance what value would there be in the California government owning only one portion of the states interconnected transmission system PGOCorp has walked away from the negotiating table and has expressed little interest in selling its transmission lines to the state No agreement with Sempra Energy parent of San Diego Gas Electric has been reached either Thus if the Gov Davis SCE agreement is approved the state of California would gain ownership rights to only a portion of the overall transmission system in the state Many legislators challenge the value of this especially when it is considered that most of the congestion that leads to higher prices within the state is concentrated along PGEs portion of the grid The counterargument to this point is that now that its utility is in bankruptcy proceedings PGOmay not have the choice of whether or not to sell its transmission assets to the state The bankruptcy judge would make this decision Thus some argue the state may have a better chance of obtaining PGEs transmission assets if it can first complete a deal with SCE The second fundamental problem is that causing California legislators to turn their back on the governors plan is what some have referred to as an obscene bailout for SCE and its parent company Some reportedly believe that Gov Davis rushed into an overly generous offer for SCE out of anxiety caused by the breakdown in his communications with PGE As noted the billion offer for SCEs assets is about times their book value so many legislators are having difficulty reconciling what appears to be an inappropriate price tag and once again a cost that taxpayers and ratepayers would ultimately have to absorb Currently SCE customers pay a FERCapproved transmission rate based upon a costplus formula If the state pays times book value it would equate to ratepayers paying two times over for those same transmission lines In addition some legislators including former Democratic allies of Gov Davis have suggested that SCE should be forced to enter bankruptcy as Pacific Gas Electric Co has done Naturally legislators will approach the issue with their constituents in mind knowing that they will be accountable for how they vote on this plan Looking at the issue from a customer perspective one could argue that SCE declaring bankruptcy would create less financial hardship for California customers than bailing out the utility and increasing rates This will be a major political challenge for California legislators to resolve if the governors plan becomes sponsored as a bill If I pull out my crystal ball and be so bold as to make projections in this case I would predict that there is little chance that Gov Davis rescue plan for SCE will pass in its current form The energy crisis in California has become so politicized that legislators will be very reticent to approve any measure that resembles a financial bailout for one of the utilities especially without obtaining something of value for the state in return It is Gov Davis personal agenda to obtain control over the states transmission assets but I dont see this as being a priority for other California lawmakers Thus the deal will be a tough sell unless some new development occurs that puts owning SCEs transmission assets in the states best interest Considering the many headaches associated with this business and the fact that the state has no expertise in this area I dont see this occurring Consequently the game is by no means over for SCE and its potential for bankruptcy does not appear to have decreased to any large extent One large California utility is already in bankruptcy court We could be only days or weeks away from seeing SCE head in that direction

nron cc Alan CT Jeff nron Joe nron Karen nron Mary CT Mona L nron Paul CT Richard nron Sandra nron Sarah nron Susan J nron Tim CT David CT Subject Re Options the Governors Considering Jeff Dasovich and I along with several IEP members met with Gov Davis staff today including his Chief of Staff his Staff Director and two polic y advisors on energy issues They made the following points The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity issues and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage but they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls a big part of the problem is a dysfunctional market a thinly veiled reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room The Governors view is that all participants regulators utilities customers and generators must behave responsibly Everyone must share the pain The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature returns next week and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati ve proposals in the next couple of weeks While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals in the attached email were unofficial and for discussion purposes only it was fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of new information The IEP group was on message making the usual arguments about the need for forward contracting expedited generation and transmissi on siting a

would have utilities absorbing some of th e deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo rm of higher rates That leaves generators who they might want to either agree to some refunds or provide power at lower goingforward prices The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions but the Davis administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to

along with several IEP members met with Gov Davis staff today including his Chief of Staff his Staff Director and two policy advisors on energy issues They made the following points The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity issues and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage but they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls a big part of the problem is a dysfunctional market a thinly veiled reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room The Governors view is that all participants regulators utilities customers and generators must behave responsibly Everyone must share the pain The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature returns next week and the Governor will be putting forth several legislative proposals in the next couple of weeks While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals in the attached email were unofficial and for discussion purposes only it was fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of new information The IEP group was on message making the usual arguments about the need for forward contracting expedited generation and transmission siting a real retail market to promote demand side responses etc The staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution but remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money and remain subject to rate caps possible restrictions on sales outside the state at least at peak times etc One approach they appear to be toying with is a share the pain proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of the deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the form of higher rates That leaves generators who they might want to either agree to some refunds or

PM To Richard nron cc Subject Fw Analysis of Supreme Court decision One for you too Jeff Forwarded by Jeffrey A ShankmanHOUECT on PM Ben Macklowe on PM To cc Subject Fw Analysis of Supreme Court decision Original Message From Elizabeth Prickett Morgan To Sent Thursday December PM Subject Analysis of Supreme Court decision A friend sent me the following QA it sums up the legal issues very clearly Q Im not a lawyer and I dont understand the recent Supreme Court decision in Bush v Gore Can you explain it to me A Sure Im a lawyer I read it It says Bush wins even if Gore got the most votes Q But wait a second The US Supreme Court has to give a reason right A Right Q So Bush wins because handcounts are illegal A Oh no Six of the justices twothirds majority believed the handcounts were legal and should be done Q Oh So the justices did not believe that the handcounts would find any legal ballots A Nope The five conservative justices clearly held and all nine justices agreed that punch card balloting machines can produce an unfortunate number of ballots which are not punched in a clean complete way by the voter So there are legal votes that should be counted but cant be Q Oh Does this have something to do with states rights Dont conservatives love that A Generally yes These five justices have held that the federal government has no business telling a sovereign state university it cant steal trade secrets just because such stealing is prohibited by law Nor does the federal government have any business telling a state that it should bar guns in schools Nor can the federal government use the equal protection clause to force states to take measures to stop violence against women Q Is there an exception in this case A Yes the Gore exception States have no rights to have their own state elections when it can result in Gore being elected President This decision is limited to only this situation Q Cmon The Supremes didnt really say that Youre exaggerating A Nope They held Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances or the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities Q What complexities A They dont say Q Ill bet I know the reason I heard Jim Baker say this The votes cant be counted because the Florida Supreme Court changed the rules of the election after it was held Right A Dead wrong The US Supreme Court made clear that the Florida Supreme Court did not change the rules of the election But the US Supreme Court found the failure of the Florida Court to change the rules was wrong Q Huh A The Legislature declared that the only legal standard for counting vote is clear intent of the voter The Florida Court was condemned for not adopting a clearer standard Q I thought the Florida Court was not allowed to change the Legislatures law after the election A Right Q So whats the problem A They should have The US Supreme Court said the Florida Supreme Court should have adopted adequate statewide standards for determining what is a legal vote Q I thought only the Legislature could adopt new law A Right Q So if the Court had adopted new standards I thought it would have been overturned A Right Youre catching on Q If the Court had adopted new standards it would have been overturned for changing the rules And if it didnt its overturned for not changing the rules That means that no matter what the Florida Supreme Court did legal votes could never be counted A Right Next question Q Wait wait I thought the problem was equal protection that some counties counted votes differently from others Isnt that a problem A It sure is Across the nation we vote in a hodgepodge of systems Some like the opticalscanners in largely Republicanleaning counties record of the votes Some like the punchcard systems in largely Democraticleaning counties record only of the votes So approximately of Democratic votes are thrown in the trash can Q Aha Thats a severe equalprotection problem A No its not The Supreme Court wasnt worried about the of Democratic ballots thrown in the trashcan in Florida That complexity was not a problem Q Was it the butterfly ballots that violated Florida law and tricked more than Democrats to vote for Buchanan or Gore and Buchanan A Nope The Supreme Court has no problem believing that Buchanan got his highest best support in a precinct consisting of a Jewish old age home with Holocaust survivors who apparently have changed their mind about Hitler Q Yikes So what was the serious equal protection problem A The problem was neither the butterfly ballot nor the of Democrats largely AfricanAmerican disenfranchised The problem is that somewhat less than of the ballots may have been determined under slightly different standards because judges sworn to uphold the law and doing their best to accomplish the legislative mandate of clear intent of the voter may have a slightly opinion about the voters intent Q Hmmm OK so if those votes are thrown out you can still count the votes where everyone agrees the voters intent is clear A Nope Q Why not A No time Q No time to count legal votes where everyone even Republicans agree the intent is clear Why not A Because December was yesterday Q Is December a deadline for counting votes A No January is the deadline In Hawaiis votes werent counted until January Q So why is December important A December is a deadline by which Congress cant challenge the results Q What does the Congressional role have to do with the Supreme Court A Nothing Q But I thought A The Florida Supreme Court had earlier held it would like to complete its work by December to make things easier for Congress The United States Supreme Court is trying to help the Florida Supreme Court out by forcing the Florida court to abide by a deadline that everyone agrees is not binding Q But I thought the Florida Court was going to just barely have the votes counted by December A They would have made it but the five conservative justices stopped the recount last Saturday Q Why A Justice Scalia said some of the counts may not be legal Q So why not separate the votes into piles indentations for Gore hanging chads for Bush votes that everyone agrees went to one candidate or the other so that we know exactly how Florida voted before determining who won Then if some ballots say indentations have to be thrown out the American people will know right away who won Florida A Great idea The US Supreme Court rejected it They held that such counts would likely to produce election results showing Gore won and Gores winning would cause public acceptance and that would cast a cloud over Bushs legitimacy that would harm democratic stability Q In other words if America knows the truth that Gore won they wont accept the US Supreme Court overturning Gores victory A Yes Q Is that a legal reason to stop recounts or a political one A Lets just say in all of American history and all of American law this reason has no basis in law But that doesnt stop the five conservatives from creating new law out of thin air Q Arent these conservative justices against judicial activism A Yes when liberal judges are perceived to have done it Q Well if the December deadline is not binding why not count the votes A The US Supreme Court after admitting the December deadline is not binding set December as a binding deadline at pm on December Q Didnt the US Supreme Court condemn the Florida Supreme Court for arbitrarily setting a deadline A Yes Q But but A Not to worry The US Supreme Court does not have to follow laws it sets for other courts Q So who caused Florida to miss the December deadline A The Bush lawyers who first went to court to stop the recount the rentamob in Miami that got paid Florida vacations for intimidating officials and the US Supreme Court for stopping the recount Q So who is punished for this behavior A Gore of course Q Tell me this Floridas laws are unconstitutional A Yes Q And the laws of states that allow votes to be cast or counted differently are unconstitutional A Yes And states have the clear intent of the voter standard that the US Supreme Court found was illegal in Florida Q Then why arent the results of states thrown out A Um Becauseumthe Supreme Court doesnt say Q But if Floridas certification includes counts expressly declared by the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional we dont know who really won the election there right A Right Though a careful analysis by the Miami Herald shows Gore won Florida by about votes excluding the butterfly ballot errors Q So what do we do have a revote throw out the entire state count under a single uniform standard A No We just dont count the votes that favor Gore Q Thats completely bizarre That sounds like rank political favoritism Did the justices have any financial interest in the case A Scalias two sons are both lawyers working for Bush Thomass wife is collecting applications for people who want to work in the Bush administration Q Why didnt they recuse themselves A If either had recused himself the vote would be and the Florida Supreme Court decision allowing recounts would have been affirmed Q I cant believe the justices acted in such a blatantly political way A Read the opinions for yourself supremecourtdecpdf December stay stopping the recount opinionspdfpdf December opinion Q So what are the consequences of this A The guy who got the most votes in the US and in Florida and under our Constitution Al Gore will lose to Americas second choice who won the all important Supreme Court vote Q I thought in a democracy the guy with the most votes wins A True in a democracy But America is not a democracy In America in the guy with the most US Supreme Court votes wins Q So what will happen to the Supreme Court when Bush becomes President A He will appoint more justices in the mode of Thomas and Scalia to ensure that the will of the people is less and less respected Soon lawless justices may constitute or even on the court Q Is there any way to stop this A YES No federal judge can be confirmed without a vote in the Senate It takes votes to break a filibuster If only of the Democratic Senators stand up to Bush and his Supremes and say that they will not approve a single judge appointed by him until a President can be democratically elected in the judicial reign of terror can endand one day we can hope to return to the rule of law Q What do I do now A Email this to everyone you know and write or call your senator reminding him that Gore beat Bush by several hundred thousand votes three times Kennedys margin over Nixon and that you believe that VOTERS rather than JUDGES should determine who wins an election by counting every vote And to protect our judiciary from overturning

Today Opinion Electricity Prices newscommentdebatehtm Updated AM ET Prices spike as Calif bungles deregulation When Californians bought into the idea of deregulated electricity in they did so on the promise theyd get reliable power at cheap prices Instead theyre facing power shortages and whopping bills The states public utilities commission is scheduled to decide Thursd ay whether to let two big utilities raise rates by up to ending a price freeze that was supposed to last until Financially strapped utilities meanwhile are threatening blackouts With electricity deregulation underway in other states households nationwide should be wondering whether theyll be next to face Californiastyle chaos It is a red flag that electricity deregulation whi ch continues to hold promise for lower rates must be approached cautiously an d gradually California made a series of remarkably large blunders many encourage d by utilities that set the state on a dangerous path to deregulation without t he competition needed to hold down prices Unless the state corrects those errors matters will get worse when full deregulation comes in two years Much of the state could be served by power monopolies free to hike prices The good news is that other deregulating states have planned better though the process in those states is less advanced than in California Among Californias failings Utilities were barred from raising rates to consumers but had to cope with market prices from power plants When deregulation began the utilities heartily backed the arrangement because the frozen prices were far higher than the market prices they paid Now with a national energy shortage pushing prices higher theyre worried about bankruptcy threatening blackouts and pleading for relief Some seek reregulation to protect themselves from their own ineptitude The state failed to bring enough new supply online before deregulatin g No major plants were built in the previous decade contributing to a supply crunch in a state where electricity demand has been growing per year By contrast Texas which is rolling out its deregulation more slowly has since built new plants that have added more powergeneration California tried to manipulate prices and blew it The state required utilities to buy all of their power from a power exchange in shortterm blocks This prevented utilities from entering longterm contracts or adopting hedging strategies that could keep prices stable After prices spiked the government worsened the situation by trying to cap prices utilities could pay for power Not surprisingly power suppliers then sold their electricity to other states without price caps where they could get a better return Result power shortages rectified only by an emergency feder al order that some outofstate plants in the West sell California electricity Price controls were lifted Other states have avoided this problem New York for instance encou raged its utilities to enter into transition contracts under which plants have an obligation to sell them power Similarly Texas has longterm contracts under which the utilities buy power for long periods at set prices allowin g them to hedge against shortterm changes in price The price of all this bungling will be huge for Californians but hou seholds outside California may pay as well The Western plants that the federal government has forced to supply Californias thirst could in time have difficulty supplying their traditional customers driving up their prices In the extreme the financial instability of California utilities Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison could roil markets and add to recession pressures At a minimum most Californians will soon face significant financial pain unwarranted on their part to pay for the botched deregulation either through taxes or higher rates If this bailout isnt accompanied by new rules the ending of price caps may bring the worst of all worlds monopoly markets without price controls Long term the best hope for controlling prices is competition but California has yet to come up with a convincing plan to make sure that exists In fact in the San Diego area where controls were briefly lifted without significant new competition prices more than doubled Some advocacy groups and politicians are calling for more radical sol utions such as a state buyout of the utilities or simple refusal to pay the utilities on the grounds they must be hiding money somewhere The utilities having tasted their own medicine now say theyd support reregulation But none of these fixes would save Californias consumers from the di mbulb management that has put the state at risk of power outages and financial catastrophe California Gov Gray Davis said recently that if deregulation fails in California it is dead in America To the contrary as California does its repair work the rest of the county will be taking notes on how not to deregulate as carelessly as California did Updated AM ET Learn from California mistake By Harvey Rosenfield and Douglas Heller The myth of electricity deregulation has met reality in California a nd the result is a billion debacle Awash in energyindustry campaign contributions California lawmakers freed the states utility companies of price controls in Consumers were ordered to pay off the utilities debts after which competition was suppos ed to kick in guaranteeing a rate cut by Deregulation proved a bonanza for the utilities They sold some of th eir power plants and collected billion in ratepayer subsidies They used th e money to purchase plants in other countries reward their executives with huge pay raises buy back stock and increase dividends Profits reached record levels this year Envious the handful of unregulated companies that control nearly hal f of the states electricity generation decided to cash in too This cartel began t o withhold power causing shortages that boosted the wholesale price of electricity that utility companies must buy by But ironically because of the way they wrote the deregulation law the utilities are forbidden to pass the higher costs on to most consumers until Now the companies want to rewrite the law When public officials resi sted the utilities demands for immediate rate hikes the utilities threatened blackouts and bankruptcy When that economic extortion failed Wall Street issued an ultimatum Order a rate hike within hours as a first installment of an billion ratepayer bailout or Wall Street would itsel f force the utilities into bankruptcy California has learned the hard way that electricity is too vital to be left in the hands of unregulated corporations whose sole interest is maximizing profits Facing a ratepayer revolt state officials have reimposed regulation To make electricity reliable and affordable once more they are considering establishing a nonprofit publicly owned power system for the state But in the meantime the deregulation disaster could end up costing each Californian Meanwhile elsewhere in the nation corporatefunded ideologues and a cademics continue to promote electricity deregulation much as they promoted looseni ng

this out at FERC If someone internal can do it great Thoughts Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on PM Steve CT PM To Jeff NRON cc Alan CT James D nron Jeff NRON Mary CT Paul CT Richard nron Susan J NRON Subject Re Cost of Protectionism Jeff In order for California to shut its doors it must open its interconnections with the rest of the west and become a Texaslike electrical island This they cannot do California has a substantial investment in units located in Nevada Arizona New Mexico and Utah The lights would go out in California if they opened the ties In the s there was a hue and cry over loop flow with California claiming that it was being injured by others particularly by the interior systems trading practices however they never considered opening the ties because the benefits of interconnection were so large that the cost of loop flow was far exceeded by the value of regional trade ie they are economically interdependent If such a foolish thing were done and California full closed its doors by opening its ties cost would go up in the Northwest in California and all the rest of the Western System There are gains for trade which accrue to all parties from interconnection The trade is more complicated than just summerwinter peaks seasonal load diversity there is also seasonal resource diversity Spring run off effects and finally there opportunity to capitalize on storage vs base load thermal operations I will address the last point first to illustrate the complexity of the trading patterns The interior west Montana Wyoming Utah Arizona and New Mexico has large amount of base load coal plants As load drops off in those areas the energy flows to the coast to back off peaking plants and to back off hydro The reduction of hydro production allows night time reservoir refill which can be used to meet peak load in the Northwest and California This can be seen in the attached file which contains a set of plots for hourly flow on the Pacific DC Intertie Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun In these plots the clear daynight exchange of energy can be seen especially in the Jun plot when sales are being made to California in the day and to the Northwest at night This day to night storage exchange benefits lowers costs for everyone On top of this dailyweekly cycle there is the seasonal shift in load diversity you noted For the Northwest its peak load occurs when energy production is the lowest during the winter As a stand alone system the Pacific Northwest ie the Columbia Drainage area is energy constrained The hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs There is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak but not enough to total water flow Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana eg Colstrip and Bridger are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annual energy requirement With these energy inputs from the coal fields the seasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydro system although fish navigation irrigation etc impose an increasing number of constraints Energy imports from in the winter from the South help to meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved until the snow pack is better know in early Spring Some of the sales to the Northwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement from Desert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Interties to the Northwest Finally the Spring run offfish flush when production on the river is at a maximum and load in the Northwest is down The sale of these surpluses paid for the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system Much system maintenance of base load units has been historically been planned to take advantage of this factor Again both California and the Northwest benefit from this trade In all cases the parties would be worse off if the ties were open and everyone was on their own The Northwest may be capacity long but it is typically energy short even in flush hydro years The winter energy imports from the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to the South lower energy costs in California California cannot craft a solo solution that ignores the rest of the West It is probably hard to decide who would be worst off if California closed its doors It is only clear that total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West from which it divorced itself I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise Steve Jeff NRON Sent by Jeff NRON AM To James D nron cc Alan CT Mary CT Steve CT Susan J NRON Richard nron Paul CT Subject Re Cost of Protectionism To Jims last point I understand that the good ol utility system was often operated with little regard for basic economic principles but theres something in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess and it seems to always be tied to this notion that California is a net importer even in the winter Im going to start with the economics and then let folks describe why it seemingly doesnt apply in Western electricity markets Just about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion If California closes its doors the other Western states will pay higher prices for power andor face increased threats to reliability Im struggling to try to determine why these basic principles arent applicable to Western power markets I understand that the PNW is a very complex place and that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has developed over the years To keep it simple though not necessarily accurate Ive confined the analysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist The basic situation The PNW peaks in the winter California peaks in the summer Lets take two scenarios The West less California is so awash in electricity that even in its peakthe Winterit still has power to send to California ie it has so overbuilt its system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California Irrespective there have to my limited knowledge always been sales from CA to the PNW during the winter when the PNW is peaking The only conclusion that one can make assuming that the PNW is awash in electricity is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes economic sense to do so That is during the winter peaking months it must be cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than produce itself Otherwise its difficult to understand why it would buy from California during this month particularly if theyre long As such at a minimum the PNWs electric bill will necessarily increase if California closes its doors Neither the PNW nor California has indigenous capacity to meet peaking load Therefore the PNW must buy Californias power during its peaking summer period and California must buy power during its summer peaking period In this case not only will the PNWs bill go up if California closes its doors the lights are likely to go because theyll be short power I realize that this is a simplistic model and that there could be other legitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW eg transmission costs And again I also realize that economics may not have traditionally been a driver in the industry But I thought it might be useful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the question that Jim asks With that Ill pose the question understanding the simplicity of the model set forth above Given that California sends power northeven if the PNW is longhow can California closing it doors not increase the PNWs cost of power Best Jeff James D Steffes AM To Alan CT cc Jeff nron Mary CT Steve CT Susan J nron Subject Re Cost of Protectionism It seems to me that this information leads one to conclude that the value of an open transmission network is that California does not have to build MW of power plant MW max input in state In other words if California were to disconnect from the grid someone would have to build additional power plants instate The cost to California consumers is therefore the annual carrying cost of MW plants made even more expensive after California expropriates the current fleet of merchant generation From the perspective of the remainder of the West the question still remains if California does go it alone what is the economic impact Other than legal arguments about Interstate Commerce why should the Federal Government want to continue to pursue open acess This is the hard question that we need to answer Jim Alan CT PM To James D nron Jeff nron cc Susan J NRON Steve CT Mary CT Subject Cost of Protectionism Jim Jeff Jim asked me in a voice mail what would be the cost to California of moving from the current evolving system of open access to a protectionist environment where access to the grid would be determined by a political body responding to populist pressures Here are some things to consider We can talk more and I welcome Sue Mara or Steve Waltons input California is a net importer so any restraint of trade would risk the state being able to meet its own demand See attached slides that show PNWCA trade Even in the winter power on a net basis flows south Limiting open access would primarily act to hold instate generators hostage this will kill incentives for new investment If the ISOs proposal for market power mitigation are any guide of where a protectionist ISO would go instate generators would be required to sell forward or lose their market based rate certificates load serving entities would be required to contract forward for load and a reserve margin This is costly it will lead to centralized planning solutions to reliability rather than more efficient market outcomes Artifical notions of just and reasonable rates on top of unreasonable reserve requirements would lead to severe reliability problems In other words if Steve Peace has his way the imports into the state will drop off signficanly There is no reason the state would be more effective at expanding the grid eg Path than the current system Although admittedly the current system

with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWRs longterm contracts Everyone This is hot news showing that the CAISOCDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought I am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and FERCs attention According to two sources the CAISO is helping to bail Gov Davis out of his highpriced CDWR longterm power contracts by purchasing CDWRs excess energy as an Out Of Market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the CAISOs Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff The costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISOs surreptitious transactions This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy RealTime auction first CAISO Tariff Dispatch Protocol section d Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy bids can the CAISO buy Out Of Market OOM energy If the CAISO were following the Tariff CDWRs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energywhich is often as low as Therefore under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as Therefore the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it While there is no evidence that Gov Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first this behavior clearly benefits Davis Absent the CAISOs purchases of CDWRs excess energy CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers The media has been been making hay out of Daviss strategy of buying high and selling low Therefore Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts Of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the CAISO The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who frequently seeing minute Ex Post prices of expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to These SCs are in for a big surprise According to one source at Sierra Pacific the CAISO charged him as much as MWh for imbalance energy Where is the price mitigation here Who benefits under this scam Davis and CDWR Who loses under this scam Instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy Sources Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and the Friday Burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito There is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market OOM calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post BEEP market As one of our faithful observers told me The ISO will be billing some DRWCERS longterm contracts to SCs as OOM energy This has been confirmed by the ISO This means there is no realtime price transparency We may see an hourly expost price of say but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual RealTime settlement price There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesnt post that information The implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait days before theyhave any idea of the price This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERCs goals of creating open transparent markets Here is the

Mgmt Subject Revelation Steve Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds mwh is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO His response was this that the CAISO is charging regardless of the INC and DEC prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS In effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS Kit

I agree the message ought to be delivered Im not optimistic there is time for the legislature to do anything else at this point If nothing else it would be good let the decision makers know that their plan may not have the hoped for result so they cant say no one told them dn Original Message Date pm Tuesday From AL ALEXANDERSON To IXGateWIZ CC DOUGLAS NICHOLS Subject RENew Unofficial Committee Contacting Decision Makers Doug and I have been debating wether there might be a broader Enron plan to support the legislation even with the billion shortage to sellers Were still trying to get Enron guidance on this Possibly wed rather have an expensive solution instead of no solution Im traveling with my cell phone all of tomorrow and Doug is working on Enron Central Please stand by in terms of adding our name to the agressive list Sorry for the mixed signals al Howard J Weg PM I have not heard back from all members of the Unofficial Committee regarding my email dated August with respect to the proposal to contact the Governor and Legislators regarding the pending legislation on SCE Some have suggested that the message needs to be stronger and others have suggested that the message is too strong Our Ex Officio members BPA and WAPA want it to be clear that they are not involved in any way with addressing the state government on this or other issues As you know I want very much to reach as broad of a consensus on this action as is possible and to protect the interests of all members Virtually all members agree that a bankruptcy case for or litigation against SCE would probably not be a good thing and we do not want to advocate for bankruptcy or litigation After all the Unofficial Committee was organized to provide a different approach generally The purpose of contacting the Governor and the Legislature is to let them know that the legislation they are now considering which leaves SCE about billion short on the proposed financing to pay creditors may cause some other sellers to take precipitous action in filing an involuntary petitition or initiating litigation or arbitration that could delay or prevent the financing at even the lower billion level which will adversly affect SCE and all creditors generally We should point out that not all sellers are in agreement on what action will be taken The message is not intended to threaten anything and it is not necessarily designed to stop legislation altogether only legislation that might actually make the situation worse for all sellers and SCE The tone of the presentation if we make one will be low key non threatening and in the spirit of helping the legislature and the Governor design a package that will avoid the bankruptcy litigation and other alternatives that others might be forced to consider if the bill is passed leaving the energy sellers out in the cold If there remain some members of the Committee that are not willing to be associated with the message outlined above then I propose that we give such members the alternative of remaining members of the Unofficial Committee and allowing us if asked to identify any such members that prefer not to be a part of the message although they want to support an approach that avoids litigation and bankruptcy for SCE I understand that the LADWP and Coral Power would like this approach adopted As I explained in my prior email it has been suggested that the proposed bill that leaves SCE short by a billion dollars will likely pass after Labor Day and before the Sept adjournment That is why timing is important Those of you that have not responed please respond Those of you that were concerned that the message was unclear please review this email and consider or reconsider your positions as the case may be As of right now there are only votes in favor and against The polls are still open so please let me know your position You should be aware that the City of Glendale notified me that it determined that actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Unofficial Committee required it to resign from the Unofficial Committee

and with the initial severance process completed it seemed an appropriate time to e ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future Before I turn to the organizational changes I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance youll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart Leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegeI am thankful for every day that I have had that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re sponsibility This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat ed group of professionals and support staff and who to a person are also very decent and good people To say goodbye to some of our colleagues is not easy I want to on behalf of all of us thank them for their hard wor k their integrity their decency and the good times and laughter that we shared I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done As to the organizational structure it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines particularly within the US has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times The nee d to rationalize the organizational structure in order to consolidate all US energy functions is a strong need from my perspective As a result Jim Steffes will lead the US Energy group along with Sue Nord who will j ointly report to Jim and myself Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h elp Jim shoulder a significant burden Also reporting to Jim will be a lea dership group for US Energy that will be as follows Wholesale Electrici ty will be led by Christi Nicolay Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will be led by Harry Kingerski Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner La st but not least Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara who will continue to focus o n California energy issues will report to Jim Sue Mara will also be part of the Wholesale electricity team Steve Montovano who will continue to report to me will lead a commercial development effort along with Dan Allegretti With the elimination of the regional groups I also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our politicalleg islative needs across the US Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w ill address that need and that will focus on state political support Paul will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev elopment efforts across the US Much of the rest of the group remains the same Linda Robertson will conti nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel who reports to Linda taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC Amr Ibrahi m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function Maggy Huson will take over su pport of the nonenergy business units which are as follows Global Market s Industrial Markets Networks and Broadband Rob Hemstock will continue to lead the support of Enron Canada Paul Dawson who heads up government affairs for Europe Sergio Assad who heads up government affairs for Sout h America and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther who head up our Asian efforts will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company That Comm ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock Maggy Huson Amr Ibrahim Paul Kaufman Harry Kingerski Leslie Lawner Steve Montovano Christi Nicolay Sue Nord Sarah Novosel Linda Robertson Jim Steffes and myself We will also con tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson Harry King erski Sue Nord Linda Robertson Jim Steffes myself Finally I am form ing a DynegyEnron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of Jose Bestard Paul Dawson Paul Kaufman Sue Nord Sarah Novosel and myself No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf ect or permanent I believe these changes will make us better and more pre pared for the future However we must be prepared to further adjust as th e future unfolds for the company One final note I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company We are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr oup fundamentally altered but we must resolve to do our best for each othe r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges f or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy reflects the excelle nce and integrity that has characterized our group Personally I will do all I can for as long as I can to steer the group through this to the ver y best place possible Your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated Hang in there and thanks

important notices and papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to address over the next few months These issues are extremely important to Enron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve most of these issues for many years There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it is ready to act and we need to be ready to respond In an effort to coordinate our efforts we have developed coverage teams to respond to these FERC initiatives The Washington advocacy group will also work closely with all of these teams If someone is interested in a particular issue and was not included on that team please feel free to call the Project Lead to have your name added to the team All assistance is welcome As you will see on the attached chart many of the deadlines for responding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks so the teams need to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly On the attached chart we have listed in the left column each of the FERC initiatives that will be starting or are currently underway A Project Lead has been named for each initiative The Project Lead will be responsible for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in the proceeding The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the next couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward The team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues should be addressed what is the best way for Enron to respond to them and producing draft comments Once draft comments are prepared the comments will be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enrons important issues There is a column of Inside Counsel and Outside Services In some areas we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not Where we do not list outside counsel we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments with significant input from the team members Please remember however that even if outside services are listed the RCR process must still be followed If applicable Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lead named for each proceeding RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October and we hope to have an executive from Enron make a presentation on one of the panels Comments will be submitted to FERC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs This team will also be responsible for these comments Standards of Conduct NOPR Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead Comments are due in approximately days Several issues are raised in this proceeding including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utilitys marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal ICAP Inquiry Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements whether they are needed and what impact such requirements have on the market Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed We will submit expert testimony on this issue California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation Alan Comnes will be the Project Lead Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible Furthermore a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California Californias summer peaking season is over but the Pacific Northwests winter peaking season will be starting soon and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest where it will be needed this winter This team will be responsible for both of these proceedings Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues Steve Walton is the Project Lead FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints Californias Path and the Central East Interface in New York and plans to have the study completed later this year The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it In a relating proceeding the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues The team will also oversee the progress in these proceedings Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements Susan Lindberg is the Project Lead The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market participants to provide more information than is currently required including at least seven additional data points per transaction This will have a significant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information Comments are due on October California Refund Proceeding Ray Alvarez is the Project Lead The Commission has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the California ISO from October through June and has established a hearing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding Bob Frank is the Project Lead The Judge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that refunds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest Briefs will be filed in response to the decision and the Commission will review the Judges order MidwestAlliance RTO Proceeding Mike Roan is the Project Lead Various filings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTOs in the Midwest the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO Enron is advocating consistent with the Commissions recent pronouncements one single RTO in the Midwest The Commission is expected to act on these filings shortly Proceedings may be ordered Northeast RTO Proceeding Sarah Novosel is the Project Lead Mediation to create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judges report is pending before the Commission A Commission order is expected on or before October Additional proceedings may be ordered Southeast RTO Proceeding Christi Nicolay is the Project Lead Mediation to create a single Southeast RTO has

nron cc Alan CT Jeff nron Joe nron Karen nron Mary CT Mona L nron Paul CT Richard nron Sandra nron Sarah nron Susan J nron Tim CT David CT Subject Re Options the Governors Considering Jeff Dasovich and I along with several IEP members met with Gov Davis staff today including his Chief of Staff his Staff Director and two polic y advisors on energy issues They made the following points The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity issues and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage but they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls a big part of the problem is a dysfunctional market a thinly veiled reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room The Governors view is that all participants regulators utilities customers and generators must behave responsibly Everyone must share the pain The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature returns next week and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati ve proposals in the next couple of weeks While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals in the attached email were unofficial and for discussion purposes only it was fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of new information The IEP group was on message making the usual arguments about the need for forward contracting expedited generation and transmissi on siting a real retail market to promote demand side responses etc The staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution bu t remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money a nd remain subject to rate caps possible restrictions on sales outside the sta te at least at peak times etc One approach they appear to be toying with is a share the pain proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of th e deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo rm of higher rates That leaves generators who they might want to either agree to some refunds or provide power at lower goingforward prices The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions but the Davis administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the problem I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight We should as always provide consistent and reasonable solutions I think we should prepare a document for distribution to staff legislators and anyone else that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forwar d eg in Beldens presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper and wraps them in a more political context In other words we have already articulated the right answers we now need to put a political rationale around our proposals a set of arguments which responds directly to the political

Steve and Jeff last Monday so really does want to hear more on what Enron thinks should and can be done to address all of the issues And she also understands this is not just sophisticated technical

Karen nron Mary CT Mona L nron Paul CT Richard nron Sandra nron Sarah nron Susan J nron Tim CT David CT Subject Re Options the Governors ConsideringDocument link Jeff Dasovich Jeff Dasovich and I along with several IEP members met with Gov Davis staff today including his Chief of Staff his Staff Director and two policy advisors on energy issues They made the following points The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity issues and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage but they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls a big part of the problem is a dysfunctional market a thinly veiled reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room The Governors view is that all participants regulators utilities customers and generators must behave responsibly Everyone must share the pain The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature returns next week and the Governor will be putting forth several legislative proposals in the next couple of weeks While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals in the attached email were unofficial and for discussion purposes only it was fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of new information The IEP group was on message making the usual arguments about the need for forward contracting expedited generation and transmission siting a real retail market to promote demand side responses etc The staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution but remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money and remain subject to rate caps possible restrictions on sales outside the state at least at peak times etc One approach they appear to be toying with is a share the pain proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of the deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the form of higher rates That leaves generators who they might want to either agree to some refunds or provide power at lower goingforward prices The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions but the Davis administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the problem I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight We should as always provide consistent and reasonable solutions I think we should prepare a document for distribution to staff legislators and anyone else that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forward eg in Beldens presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper and wraps them in a more political context In other words we have already articulated the right answers we now need to put a political rationale around our proposals a set of arguments which responds directly to the political opposition those answers are likely to encounter Jeff will follow up with one of the staff members in particular Kari Dohn and I would suggest that Jeff and Sandi work together on putting the necessary political

Mexico PNM shares some keys that have helped the small company find success in the wholesale power market He also looks at issues affecting deregulation both in New Mexico and across the country Read the questions Sterba was asked at wwwscientechcom IMAGE IMAGE April Deal for SCEs Transmission Assets Appears Dead on Arrival by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters California Gov Gray Davis billion dollar plan to save utility Southern California Edison SCE from bankruptcy is in deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators Legislative sources said the governor was having so much trouble gathering support for his plan that he could not find anyone to sponsor a bill One Assembly official called the SCE bailout plan the most unpopular piece of legislation in years Analysis Even when this deal was announced as an agreement in principle some days ago it seemed too farfetched to be possible The only party that clearly seems to benefit from the agreement forged between Gov Davis and SCE is the cashstrapped utility California energy customers appear to get the short end of an expensive stick while the state seemingly gains nothing of value beyond what could amount to a whole new set of administrative problems Thus despite the hype with which Gov Davis announced this rescue plan for SCE California legislatorsboth Republicans and Democratsare saying not so fast and appear to be collectively opposed to the plan as it currently stands As it becomes apparent that the California Legislature will not approve this plan the general consensus is that Gov Davis offer to SCE is simply a financial bailout for the utility that provides no benefit to California residents For background on the details of Gov Davis rescue plan for SCE please reference my IssueAlert from In a nutshell the state of California agreed to buy SCEs mile transmission grid which covers much of the southern half of the state for billion times the systems book value SCE would be allowed to use the proceeds to pay off its existing debt restoring it to financial stability Both the California Legislature and the CPUC need to approve this deal by Aug or else the agreement is terminated In the highly politicized climate under which the California energy crisis has unfolded it is imperative to understand the agendas that each stakeholder possesses For instance keep in mind that Gov Davis political career has been severely damaged by the states energy crisis and the fact that Pacific Gas Electric Co Californias largest utility company declared bankruptcy has only further tainted the governors standing Perhaps more than any other goal Davis wants to keep SCE from also filing for Chapter protection In addition Davis believes he will be better able to solve the crisis if he assumes control over the states transmission grid much like the state has assumed the role of a power purchasing agent Normally a measure supported by the Democratic governor could be easily approved by Californias Democratcontrolled legislature However the energy issue has divided support for Davis even within his own party Consequently the governor needs the support of both Republicans and Democrats in order to see his rescue plan for SCE pass For its part there was very little reason why SCE should not have agreed to the governors terms From multiple standpoints the utility gains enormously from the governors offer while at the same time it avoids lengthy and costly bankruptcy proceedings Under the agreement SCE gains a method for pulling itself out of debt via rate increases that probably would be implemented over the next years Further its parent company Edison International gets to hold on to a reported billion that SCE has provided to the corporate operation since The exception to this is a million tax refund that Edison International would give back to SCE While Davis referred to his plan as a good balanced deal some consumer groups have charged that SCE has taken the governor to the cleaners Meanwhile California customers clearly lose in the deal because they would be forced to ultimately pay for the billion that the state needs to buy the transmission assets The state would purchase the lines with bonds that would be paid off by transmission fees charged to SCE customers It is presently not clear whether or not those fees which are already part of monthly bills would be sufficient therefore it is likely that rates would be increased to support the purchase In addition the subtext of the deal is that customers would ultimately pay to drive down SCEs debt which was accumulated as a result of unrestricted wholesale power costs charged by generators Consequently California customers would bear the responsibility for prices that FERC has at times deemed unjust and unreasonable Ultimately however it is the California Legislature and CPUC that will have the authority to approve the agreement between Gov Davis and SCE These two agencies must ultimately decide if the plan is good or bad and weigh the impact for various stakeholders Presently the legislature in particular is finding that there are many questionable aspects about the plan For instance what value would there be in the California government owning only one portion of the states interconnected transmission system PGOCorp has walked away from the negotiating table and has expressed little interest in selling its transmission lines to the state No agreement with Sempra Energy parent of San Diego Gas Electric has been reached either Thus if the Gov Davis SCE agreement is approved the state of California would gain ownership rights to only a portion of the overall transmission system in the state Many legislators challenge the value of this especially when it is considered that most of the congestion that leads to higher prices within the state is concentrated along PGEs portion of the grid The counterargument to this point is that now that its utility is in bankruptcy proceedings PGOmay not have the choice of whether or not to sell its transmission assets to the state The bankruptcy judge would make this decision Thus some argue the state may have a better chance of obtaining PGEs transmission assets if it can first complete a deal with SCE The second fundamental problem is that causing California legislators to turn their back on the governors plan is what some have referred to as an obscene bailout for SCE and its parent company Some reportedly believe that Gov Davis rushed into an overly generous offer for SCE out of anxiety caused by the breakdown in his communications with PGE As noted the billion offer for SCEs assets is about times their book value so many legislators are having difficulty reconciling what appears to be an inappropriate price tag and once again a cost that taxpayers and ratepayers would ultimately have to absorb Currently SCE customers pay a FERCapproved transmission rate based upon a costplus formula If the state pays times book value it would equate to ratepayers paying two times over for those same transmission lines In addition some legislators including former Democratic allies of Gov Davis have suggested that SCE should be forced to enter bankruptcy as Pacific Gas Electric Co has done Naturally legislators will approach the issue with their constituents in mind knowing that they will be accountable for how they vote on this plan Looking at the issue from a customer perspective one could argue that SCE declaring bankruptcy would create less financial hardship for California customers than bailing out the utility and increasing rates This will be a major political challenge for California legislators to resolve if the governors plan becomes sponsored as a bill If I pull out my crystal ball and be so bold as to make projections in this case I would predict that there is little chance that Gov Davis rescue plan for SCE will pass in its current form The energy crisis in California has become so politicized that legislators will be very reticent to approve any measure that resembles a financial bailout for one of the utilities especially without obtaining something of value for the state in return It is Gov Davis personal agenda to obtain control over the states transmission assets but I dont see this as being a priority for other California lawmakers Thus the deal will be a tough sell unless some new development occurs that puts owning SCEs transmission assets in the states best interest Considering the many headaches associated with this business and the fact that the state has no expertise in this area I dont see this occurring Consequently the game is by no means over for SCE and its potential for bankruptcy does not appear to have decreased to any large extent One large California utility is already in bankruptcy court We could be only days or weeks away from seeing SCE head in that direction

Jeff nron Richard nron cc Subject Re Cost of Protectionism I recommend that we ask MRW to do a quick and dirty nothing more than k to quantify Steves qualitative analysis Good to have before we fight this out at FERC If someone internal can do it great Thoughts Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on PM Steve CT PM To Jeff NRON cc Alan CT James D nron Jeff NRON Mary CT Paul CT Richard nron Susan J NRON Subject Re Cost of Protectionism Jeff In order for California to shut its doors it must open its interconnections with the rest of the west and become a Texaslike electrical island This they cannot do California has a substantial investment in units located in Nevada Arizona New Mexico and Utah The lights would go out in California if they opened the ties In the s there was a hue and cry over loop flow with California claiming that it was being injured by others particularly by the interior systems trading practices however they never considered opening the ties because the benefits of interconnection were so large that the cost of loop flow was far exceeded by the value of regional trade ie they are economically interdependent If such a foolish thing were done and California full closed its doors by opening its ties cost would go up in the Northwest in California and all the rest of the Western System There are gains for trade which accrue to all parties from interconnection The trade is more complicated than just summerwinter peaks seasonal load diversity there is also seasonal resource diversity Spring run off effects and finally there opportunity to capitalize on storage vs base load thermal operations I will address the last point first to illustrate the complexity of the trading patterns The interior west Montana Wyoming Utah Arizona and New Mexico has large amount of base load coal plants As load drops off in those areas the energy flows to the coast to back off peaking plants and to back off hydro The reduction of hydro production allows night time reservoir refill which can be used to meet peak load in the Northwest and California This can be seen in the attached file which contains a set of plots for hourly flow on the Pacific DC Intertie Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun In these plots the clear daynight exchange of energy can be seen especially in the Jun plot when sales are being made to California in the day and to the Northwest at night This day to night storage exchange benefits lowers costs for everyone On top of this dailyweekly cycle there is the seasonal shift in load diversity you noted For the Northwest its peak load occurs when energy production is the lowest during the winter As a stand alone system the Pacific Northwest ie the Columbia Drainage area is energy constrained The hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs There is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak but not enough to total water flow Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana eg Colstrip and Bridger are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annual energy requirement With these energy inputs from the coal fields the seasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydro system although fish navigation irrigation etc impose an increasing number of constraints Energy imports from in the winter from the South help to meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved until the snow pack is better know in early Spring Some of the sales to the Northwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement from Desert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Interties to the Northwest Finally the Spring run offfish flush when production on the river is at a maximum and load in the Northwest is down The sale of these surpluses paid for the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system Much system maintenance of base load units has been historically been planned to take advantage of this factor Again both California and the Northwest benefit from this trade In all cases the parties would be worse off if the ties were open and everyone was on their own The Northwest may be capacity long but it is typically energy short even in flush hydro years The winter energy imports from the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to the South lower energy costs in California California cannot craft a solo solution that ignores the rest of the West It is probably hard to decide who would be worst off if California closed its doors It is only clear that total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West from which it divorced itself I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise Steve Jeff NRON Sent by Jeff NRON AM To James D nron cc Alan CT Mary CT Steve CT Susan J NRON Richard nron Paul CT Subject Re Cost of Protectionism To Jims last point I understand that the good ol utility system was often operated with little regard for basic economic principles but theres something in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess and it seems to always be tied to this notion that California is a net importer even in the winter Im going to start with the economics and then let folks describe why it seemingly doesnt apply in Western electricity markets Just about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion If California closes its doors the other Western states will pay higher prices for power andor face increased threats to reliability Im struggling to try to determine why these basic principles arent applicable to Western power markets I understand that the PNW is a very complex place and that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has developed over the years To keep it simple though not necessarily accurate Ive confined the analysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist The basic situation The PNW peaks in the winter California peaks in the summer Lets take two scenarios The West less California is so awash in electricity that even in its peakthe Winterit still has power to send to California ie it has so overbuilt its system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California Irrespective there have to my limited knowledge always been sales from CA to the PNW during the winter when the PNW is peaking The only conclusion that one can make assuming that the PNW is awash in electricity is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes economic sense to do so That is during the winter peaking months it must be cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than produce itself Otherwise its difficult to understand why it would buy from California during this month particularly if theyre long As such at a minimum the PNWs electric bill will necessarily increase if California closes its doors Neither the PNW nor California has indigenous capacity to meet peaking load Therefore the PNW must buy Californias power during its peaking summer period and California must buy power during its summer peaking period In this case not only will the PNWs bill go up if California closes its doors the lights are likely to go because theyll be short power I realize that this is a simplistic model and that there could be other legitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW eg transmission costs And again I also realize that economics may not have traditionally been a driver in the industry But I thought it might be useful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the question that Jim asks With that Ill pose the question understanding the simplicity of the model set forth above Given that California sends power northeven if the PNW is longhow can California closing it doors not increase the PNWs cost of power Best Jeff James D Steffes AM To Alan CT cc Jeff nron Mary CT Steve CT Susan J nron Subject Re Cost of Protectionism It seems to me that this information leads one to conclude that the value of an open transmission network is that California does not have to build MW of power plant MW max input in state In other words if California were to disconnect from the grid someone would have to build additional power plants instate The cost to California consumers is therefore the annual carrying cost of MW plants made even more expensive after California expropriates the current fleet of merchant generation From the perspective of the remainder of the West the question still remains if California does go it alone what is the economic impact Other than legal arguments about Interstate Commerce why should the Federal Government want to continue to pursue open acess This is the hard question that we need to answer Jim Alan CT PM To James D nron Jeff nron cc Susan J NRON Steve CT Mary CT Subject Cost of Protectionism Jim Jeff Jim asked me in a voice mail what would be the cost to California of moving from the current evolving system of open access to a protectionist environment where access to the grid would be determined by a political body responding to populist pressures Here are some things to consider We can talk more and I welcome Sue Mara or Steve Waltons input California is a net importer so any restraint of trade would risk the state being able to meet its own demand See attached slides that show PNWCA trade Even in the winter power on a net basis flows south Limiting open access would primarily act to hold instate generators hostage this will kill incentives for new investment If the ISOs proposal for market power mitigation are any guide of where a protectionist ISO would go instate generators would be required to sell forward or lose their market based rate certificates load serving entities would be required to contract forward for load and a reserve margin This is costly it will lead to centralized planning solutions to reliability rather than more efficient market outcomes Artifical notions of just and reasonable rates on top of unreasonable reserve requirements would lead to severe reliability problems In other words if Steve Peace has his way the imports into the state will drop off signficanly There is no reason the state would be more effective at expanding the grid eg Path than the current system Although admittedly the current system has flaws The CAISO was set up with little thought to transmission expansion planning Other RTOs are not repeating this mistake

competition needed to hold down prices Unless the state corrects those errors matters will get worse when full deregulation comes in two years Much of the state could be served by power monopolies free to hike prices The good news is that other deregulating states have planned better though the process in those states is less advanced than in California Among Californias failings Utilities were barred from raising rates to consumers but had to cope with market prices from power plants When deregulation began the utilities heartily backed the arrangement because the frozen prices were far higher than the market prices they paid Now with a national energy shortage pushing prices higher theyre worried about bankruptcy threatening blackouts and pleading for relief Some seek reregulation to protect themselves from their own ineptitude The state failed to bring enough new supply online before deregulatin g No major plants were built in the previous decade contributing to a supply crunch in a state where electricity demand has been growing per year By contrast Texas which is rolling out its deregulation more slowly has since built new plants that have added more powergeneration California tried to manipulate prices and blew it The state required utilities to buy all of their power from a power exchange in shortterm blocks This prevented utilities from entering longterm contracts or adopting hedging strategies that could keep prices stable After prices spiked the government worsened the situation by trying to cap prices utilities could pay for power Not surprisingly power suppliers then sold their electricity to other states without price caps where they could get a better return Result power shortages rectified only by an emergency feder al order that some outofstate plants in the West sell California electricity Price controls were lifted Other states have avoided this problem New York for instance encou raged its utilities to enter into transition contracts under which plants have an obligation to sell them power Similarly Texas has longterm contracts under which the utilities buy power for long periods at set prices allowin g them to hedge against shortterm changes in price The price of all this bungling will be huge for Californians but hou seholds outside California may pay as well The Western plants that the federal government has forced to supply Californias thirst could in time have difficulty supplying their traditional customers driving up their prices In the extreme the financial instability of California utilities Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison could roil markets and add to recession pressures At a minimum most Californians will soon face significant financial pain unwarranted on their part to pay for the botched deregulation either through taxes or higher rates If this bailout isnt accompanied by new rules the ending of price caps may bring the worst of all worlds monopoly markets without price controls Long term the best hope for controlling prices is competition but California has yet to come up with a convincing plan to make sure that exists In fact in the San Diego area where controls were briefly lifted without significant new competition prices more than doubled Some advocacy groups and politicians are calling for more radical sol utions such as a state buyout of the utilities or simple refusal to pay the utilities on the grounds they must be hiding money somewhere The utilities having tasted their own medicine now say theyd support reregulation But none of these fixes would save Californias consumers from the di mbulb management that has put the state at risk of power outages and financial catastrophe California Gov Gray Davis said recently that if deregulation fails in California it is dead in America To the contrary as California does its repair work the rest of the county will be taking notes on how not to deregulate as carelessly as California did Updated AM ET Learn from California mistake By Harvey Rosenfield and Douglas Heller The myth of electricity deregulation has met reality in California a nd the result is a billion debacle Awash in energyindustry campaign contributions California lawmakers freed the states utility companies of price controls in Consumers were ordered to pay off the utilities debts after which competition was suppos ed to kick in guaranteeing a rate cut by Deregulation proved a bonanza for the utilities They sold some of th eir power plants and collected billion in ratepayer subsidies They used th e money to purchase plants in other countries reward their executives with huge pay raises buy back stock and increase dividends Profits reached record levels this year Envious the handful of unregulated companies that control nearly hal f of the states electricity generation decided to cash in too This cartel began t o withhold power causing shortages that boosted the wholesale price of electricity that utility companies must buy by But ironically because of the way they wrote the deregulation law the utilities are forbidden to pass the higher costs on to most consumers until Now the companies want to rewrite the law When public officials resi sted the utilities demands for immediate rate hikes the utilities threatened blackouts and bankruptcy When that economic extortion failed Wall Street issued an ultimatum Order a rate hike within hours as a first installment of an billion ratepayer bailout or Wall Street would itsel f force the utilities into bankruptcy California has learned the hard way that electricity is too vital to be left in the hands of unregulated corporations whose sole interest is maximizing profits Facing a ratepayer revolt state officials have reimposed regulation To make electricity reliable and affordable once more they are considering establishing a nonprofit publicly owned power system for the state But in the meantime the deregulation disaster could end up costing each Californian Meanwhile elsewhere in the nation corporatefunded ideologues and a cademics continue to promote electricity deregulation much as they promoted looseni ng controls on savings and loans in the s Whenever you hear the word deregulation hold onto your wallets So me industry is about to pick your pocket Harvey Rosenfield and Douglas Heller are consumer advocates with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights Its Web site wwwconsumerwatchdogorg

To Richard nron cc Subject Fw Analysis of Supreme Court decision One for you too Jeff Forwarded by Jeffrey A ShankmanHOUECT on PM Ben Macklowe on PM To cc Subject Fw Analysis of Supreme Court decision Original Message From Elizabeth Prickett Morgan To Sent Thursday December PM Subject Analysis of Supreme Court decision A friend sent me the following QA it sums up the legal issues very clearly Q Im not a lawyer and I dont understand the recent Supreme Court decision in Bush v Gore Can you explain it to me A Sure Im a lawyer I read it It says Bush wins even if Gore got the most votes Q But wait a second The US Supreme Court has to give a reason right A Right Q So Bush wins because handcounts are illegal A Oh no Six of the justices twothirds majority believed the handcounts were legal and should be done Q Oh So the justices did not believe that the handcounts would find any legal ballots A Nope The five conservative justices clearly held and all nine justices agreed that punch card balloting machines can produce an unfortunate number of ballots which are not punched in a clean complete way by the voter So there are legal votes that should be counted but cant be Q Oh Does this have something to do with states rights Dont conservatives love that A Generally yes These five justices have held that the federal government has no business telling a sovereign state university it cant steal trade secrets just because such stealing is prohibited by law Nor does the federal government have any business telling a state that it should bar guns in schools Nor can the federal government use the equal protection clause to force states to take measures to stop violence against women Q Is there an exception in this case A Yes the Gore exception States have no rights to have their own state elections when it can result in Gore being elected President This decision is limited to only this situation Q Cmon The Supremes didnt really say that Youre exaggerating A Nope They held Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances or the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities Q What complexities A They dont say Q Ill bet I know the reason I heard Jim Baker say this The votes cant be counted because the Florida Supreme Court changed the rules of the election after it was held Right A Dead wrong The US Supreme Court made clear that the Florida Supreme Court did not change the rules of the election But the US Supreme Court found the failure of the Florida Court to change the rules was wrong Q Huh A The Legislature declared that the only legal standard for counting vote is clear intent of the voter The Florida Court was condemned for not adopting a clearer standard Q I thought the Florida Court was not allowed to change the Legislatures law after the election A Right Q So whats the problem A They should have The US Supreme Court said the Florida Supreme Court should have adopted adequate statewide standards for determining what is a legal vote Q I thought only the Legislature could adopt new law A Right Q So if the Court had adopted new standards I thought it would have been overturned A Right Youre catching on Q If the Court had adopted new standards it would have been overturned for changing the rules And if it didnt its overturned for not changing the rules That means that no matter what the Florida Supreme Court did legal votes could never be counted A Right Next question Q Wait wait I thought the problem was equal protection that some counties counted votes differently from others Isnt that a problem A It sure is Across the nation we vote in a hodgepodge of systems Some like the opticalscanners in largely Republicanleaning counties record of the votes Some like the punchcard systems in largely Democraticleaning counties record only of the votes So approximately of Democratic votes are thrown in the trash can Q Aha Thats a severe equalprotection problem A No its not The Supreme Court wasnt worried about the of Democratic ballots thrown in the trashcan in Florida That complexity was not a problem Q Was it the butterfly ballots that violated Florida law and tricked more than Democrats to vote for Buchanan or Gore and Buchanan A Nope The Supreme Court has no problem believing that Buchanan got his highest best support in a precinct consisting of a Jewish old age home with Holocaust survivors who apparently have changed their mind about Hitler Q Yikes So what was the serious equal protection problem A The problem was neither the butterfly ballot nor the of Democrats largely AfricanAmerican disenfranchised The problem is that somewhat less than of the ballots may have been determined under slightly different standards because judges sworn to uphold the law and doing their best to accomplish the legislative mandate of clear intent of the voter may have a slightly opinion about the voters intent Q Hmmm OK so if those votes are thrown out you can still count the votes where everyone agrees the voters intent is clear A Nope Q Why not A No time Q No time to count legal votes where everyone even Republicans agree the intent is clear Why not A Because December was yesterday Q Is December a deadline for counting votes A No January is the deadline In Hawaiis votes werent counted until January Q So why is December important A December is a deadline by which Congress cant challenge the results Q What does the Congressional role have to do with the Supreme Court A Nothing Q But I thought A The Florida Supreme Court had earlier held it would like to complete its work by December to make things easier for Congress The United States Supreme Court is trying to help the Florida Supreme Court out by forcing the Florida court to abide by a deadline that everyone agrees is not binding Q But I thought the Florida Court was going to just barely have the votes counted by December A They would have made it but the five conservative justices stopped the recount last Saturday Q Why A Justice Scalia said some of the counts may not be legal Q So why not separate the votes into piles indentations for Gore hanging chads for Bush votes that everyone agrees went to one candidate or the other so that we know exactly how Florida voted before determining who won Then if some ballots say indentations have to be thrown out the American people will know right away who won Florida A Great idea The US Supreme Court rejected it They held that such counts would likely to produce election results showing Gore won and Gores winning would cause public acceptance and that would cast a cloud over Bushs legitimacy that would harm democratic stability Q In other words if America knows the truth that Gore won they wont accept the US Supreme Court overturning Gores victory A Yes Q Is that a legal reason to stop recounts or a political one A Lets just say in all of American history and all of American law this reason has no basis in law But that doesnt stop the five conservatives from creating new law out of thin air Q Arent these conservative justices against judicial activism A Yes when liberal judges are perceived to have done it Q Well if the December deadline is not binding why not count the votes A The US Supreme Court after admitting the December deadline is not binding set December as a binding deadline at pm on December Q Didnt the US Supreme Court condemn the Florida Supreme Court for arbitrarily setting a deadline A Yes Q But but A Not to worry The US Supreme Court does not have to follow laws it sets for other courts Q So who caused Florida to miss the December deadline A The Bush lawyers who first went to court to stop the recount the rentamob in Miami that got paid Florida vacations for intimidating officials and the US Supreme Court for stopping the recount Q So who is punished for this behavior A Gore of course Q Tell me this Floridas laws are unconstitutional A Yes Q And the laws of states that allow votes to be cast or counted differently are unconstitutional A Yes And states have the clear intent of the voter standard that the US Supreme Court found was illegal in Florida Q Then why arent the results of states thrown out A Um Becauseumthe Supreme Court doesnt say Q But if Floridas certification includes counts expressly declared by the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional we dont know who really won the election there right A Right Though a careful analysis by the Miami Herald shows Gore won Florida by about votes excluding the butterfly ballot errors Q So what do we do have a revote throw out the entire state count under a single uniform standard A No We just dont count the votes that favor Gore Q Thats completely bizarre That sounds like rank political favoritism Did the justices have any financial interest in the case A Scalias two sons are both lawyers working for Bush Thomass wife is collecting applications for people who want to work in the Bush administration Q Why didnt they recuse themselves A If either had recused himself the vote would be and the Florida Supreme Court decision allowing recounts would have been affirmed Q I cant believe the justices acted in such a blatantly political way A Read the opinions for yourself supremecourtdecpdf December stay stopping the recount opinionspdfpdf December opinion Q So what are the consequences of this A The guy who got the most votes in the US and in Florida and under our Constitution Al Gore will lose to Americas second choice who won the all important Supreme Court vote Q I thought in a democracy the guy with the most votes wins A True in a democracy But America is not a democracy In America in the guy with the most US Supreme Court votes wins Q So what will happen to the Supreme Court when Bush becomes President A He will appoint more justices in the mode of Thomas and Scalia to ensure that the will of the people is less and less respected Soon lawless justices may constitute or even on the court Q Is there any way to stop this A YES No federal judge can be confirmed without a vote in the Senate It takes votes to break a filibuster If only of the Democratic Senators stand up to Bush and his Supremes and say that they will not approve a single judge appointed by him until a President can be democratically elected in the judicial reign of terror can endand one day we can hope to return to the rule of law Q What do I do now A Email this to everyone you know and write or call your senator reminding him that Gore beat Bush by several hundred thousand votes three times Kennedys margin over Nixon and that you believe that VOTERS rather than JUDGES should determine who wins an election by counting every vote And to protect our judiciary from overturning the will of the people you want them to confirm NO NEW JUDGES until when a president is finally chosen by most of the American people Mark H Levine Attorney at Law
