From Harshbarger RobertSMTP Sent October AM To Hackney Mark Grow Lisa Lacen Don DEMPSEY JERRY Cobb Steven Scholtes Diana Smith Chris Fotiou Demetrios Subject FW WSCC Tagging practices Okay our exchanges of email were suppose to improve mutual understanding and it seems to keep getting deeper as I go Two issues putting multiple transmission providers on the same path on a tag stacking of parallel providers and transmissionless interchange business practice Number dont we in the WSCC want the ability to have tags that can contain multiple transmission providers on the same path For example PSEI PGE and BPAT are all TPs offering JohndayCOB service There could be a transaction that would utilize a reservation with each provider and it would be most convenient to stack all that information in one tag Andy suggests the WSCC might want to comeup with an alternative such as one administrator TP for the whole path Sounds like an RTO So if we have a choice we prefer the ability to stack providers on a tag yes Number the transmissionless interchange I have been suggesting that we will continue on with our practice just using the TP that belongs to source or sink as stated in BP Andy doesnt think thatll fly in What really concerns me is his statement that Under a CA cannot exist without a parent TP Funny I always looked at it the other way around I dont know what that means to SCL CHPD and other CAs who up till now have not registered as TPs My example was a MIDC CA to CA transaction that has historically been at the bus without transmission The participants have traditionally used their interchange accounting systems to record these deals as scheduled interchange with another CA Transmission was not taken into consideration since the participants had owned andor contract rights from MIDC to their systems In addition it has been an easy way to pathitout by sinking it then creating separate transaction source at the same place I did feel that this issue shouldnt be brought to ISs attention that we would just work it out with our business practices What do you think Bob Harshbarger From Rodriquez AndySMTP Sent Monday October AM To Harshbarger Robert Subject RE WSCC Tagging practices Robert With regard to item solution C was to communicate that WSCC could explore any number of other options and propose them to either its members or to the IS For example TOs could be granted allocations of rights sold through a single virtual Tariff Administrator I guess the real goal was to pull the IS out of the decision making process and give the control to the WSCC and if the WSCC said we are going to do option a or b then that would be fine provided that a CONCRETE practice was defined so that everybody in the WSCC did it the same Item will be a problem in ETag because of how it deals with the relationship between TPs and CAs In a CA can exist independent of a TP hence the simple fix of adding a single dummy TP Under a CA cannot exist without a parent TP I think this will cause problems Theoretically it is the same answer as is used in but I think it may be much more confusing to many I would propose a formal practice registered in Policy or some other document that indicates how this is done for example create a virtual TP called WSCC Title Transfer and have WSCC entities use that specific TP or something like that This would go a long way to reducing confusion about how each CA does business I have been told it varies form company to company and even sometimes from shift to shift In your example you indicate that fake transmission is being used You also indicate that there is no CA to CA interchange occurring What is indicated by going from the PSEI control area to the PCW control area If this is a title transfer then it has been tagged incorrectly The only other interpretation I can make is that the energy is moving from the PSEI control area to the PCW control area You previous discussion seems to support this also I am not sure how dynamic schedules or grandfather transmission relate as those are required to be tagged also as they should be using transmission service I know the WSCC has been violating that practice and recently sought an exemption form the IS but at this point the exemption has been denied I would appreciate an explanation as I am unsure I yet understand what is happening Is it a title transfer or is it interchange Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp Original Message From Harshbarger Robert mailto Sent Monday October AM To Rodriquez Andy Subject RE WSCC Tagging practices Comments were inserted in your letter contained in the body of your original email Ive copied and pasted that text into a Word document formatting all screwedup comments to IS letterdoc The posted WSCC business practice reads For transactions that occur at only one bus ie no OASISGF transmission involved use a willing TP on the second line with the same PSE as on the first line and the words Single Bus in the OASIS reservation field and F as the Product Guess we need to understand what it is about that prevents someone from creating a tag for these types of transactions A related issue to this is there CAs that are not registered as TPs So when Seattle City Light sells to Chelan PUD at the MIDC who does the transmission segment of the tag Neither has registered as a TP So the transaction just doesnt get tagged Bob From Rodriquez AndySMTP Sent Monday October AM To Harshbarger Robert Cc Hackney Mark Grow Lisa DEMPSEY JERRY McIntosh Jim Lacen Don Subject RE WSCC Tagging practices Bob I did not get your attached file Please resend I know that there is fake transmission that is supposed to be used today but I continue to see situations where that is not applied As it stands today the incorrect practice will function under but not under As such I would like to see a definitive practice defined and listed someplace so that ALL of WSCC has to follow the practice Otherwise our West desk has no idea what is right or wrong and they end up having to memorize the ways that each provider likes to see their tags That is unacceptable Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs Enron Corp Original Message From Harshbarger Robert mailto Sent Friday October PM To Rodriquez Andy Cc Hackney Mark Grow Lisa DEMPSEY JERRY McIntosh Jim Lacen Don Subject FW WSCC Tagging practices Andy I markedup your draft letter with comments The second issue should be removed Our current practice is to specify fake transmission for these bus to bus control area interchanges I think that will still be possible in In any event I inserted some related comments in that section too Robert Harshbarger Puget Sound Energy OASIS Trading Manager desk cell From Rodriquez AndySMTP Sent Friday October AM To Subject WSCC Tagging practices Please review this letter and make sure it is correct These issues were brought up in our Phoenix tag training I will plan on sending to the IS Monday morning Members of the IS In our recent ETag Training sessions we had two common issues brought up regarding the way tags are handled in the WSCC We would like your guidance and assistance in regard to these issues Jointly owned transmission In the west several jointly owned transmission facilities exist In these situations one particular line or path is managed by operated within a single control area but has several different Transmission Owners In the East I believe that we address this situation by having one entity administer a single OATT and the TOs receive transmission revenues as distributions from the administrator of the OATT much the way that SPP or MAPP distribute regional tariff revenues to their members In the west they have taken a somewhat different approach In this case each TO administers their own tariff So it is possible that a transaction could utilize more than one TP on the same transmission segment In such a situation and common practice for a tag to be written that could stacks TPs So we might see in a tag a three transmission providers all flowing on the same path within the same Control Area CA TP OASIS PATH AAA AAA POINTAPOINTB AAA BBB POINTAPOINTB AAA CCC POINTAPOINTB Is this representation of the transactions physical segment valid We perceive several potential have two solutions a Tag as above for convenience b Tag as a separate tag for each TP c Indicate to WSCC that process is invalid and let them determine their own solution note there are only two possibilities here Solution c suggests a PSE can not buy transmission from multiple providers for the same path Some concerns have been raised by some WSCC members that solution a is might be difficult during curtailment processing as it is hard to determine which cuts should be made at what points However other entities point out that the tag does represent energy flow along a single contract path and the stacking really only identifies contractual relationships and as such should be allowed Regardless of how the issue is resolved we encourage the development of a standard method for handling this situation and believe that standard should be developed by either the WSCC or the IS Control Area Bus Transfers note Im not sure we can include this second issue because of the size and scope of the issues surrounding it has required a minimum of one transmission segment in the tag and the WSCC worked around this requirement by using fake PTP transmission segments The same should probably work for In the west there is the practice of moving energy to different Control Area entities at a bus In the east I we accommodate this through title transfers and consider it a market mechanism rather than an operations mechanism For example Merchant MMMMMM Generates MW in Control Area AAAA Marketer NNNNNN buys at the bus and sells to OOOOOO Marketer OOOOOO buys at the bus and sells to PPPPPP Marketer PPPPPP buys at the bus and wheels from AAAA to BBBB In the WSCC such transactions are tagged in a different manner note MIDC is not tagged like this everyone is a PSE except for the CA generating and the CA sinking or wheeling away from the MIDC There is not any CA to CA to CA to CA interchanges as long as the energy doesnt leave the bus More typical are direct transactions specifying fake transmission especially realtime CA TP PSE OASIS PATH INFO PSEI PSEMKT IDC PCW PCW PAC NOR MIDC L The WSCC practice is not currently supported by ETag The structure of ETag is predicated on the fact that energy cannot move between Control Areas without use of transmission Historically participants at the generator bus have found it more efficient to track these energy exchanges at the bus as scheduled interchange between their respective control areas In addition they typically have owned transmission andor longterm grandfather transmission rights to move energy tofrom the jointly owned bus to their systems via dynamic schedules This issue has recently been discussed by the IS with regard to such situations where transactions use NO transmission ie energy moves between CAs across bus with no transmission service If I remember correctly the IS discussed several different issues How can a single bus be simultaneously metered in several different Control Areas If no physical movement of power occurs why are these transactions tagged If the power DOES move even across a bus then shouldnt that movement be accomplished under a tariff As I remember the IS resolution it was decided that such transactions should indicate the use of PTP transmission if indeed power is moving between Control Areas Otherwise the market turn approach used in the East illustrated in the first example should be utilized This specifically becomes an issue as ETag would allow the current WSCC practice and will not We would encourage the IS to make sure WSCC is fully prepared for this situation and has WSCC practices in place that address this issue Andy
