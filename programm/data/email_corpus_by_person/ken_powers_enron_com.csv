<22908010.1075853062528.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ken.powers@enron.com,2001-07-31 11:53:30,ThanksI wanted to let you know how thankful I am for the help I received from the TW scheduling group over the past couple of months as Ive workedand struggledon the TW Daily Balancing Report I have made repeated phone calls to Houston and have always received prompt and courteous attention from the group as Ive tried to understand TMS and TWs systems and scheduling peculiarities I have worked with Amy Mulligan Cynthia Rivers Linda Ward Christine McEvoy and Bert Hernandez In particular I felt impelled to let you know that Bert Hernandez has been especially helpful in my endeavours Bert and I spent many hours on the phone discussing TWs scheduling intricacies He has been very patient with me and always made himself available to me to answer my questions He was able to discuss in great detail many TW transactions including why and how transactions appear the way they do and what the transactional data means He even went so far as to ask other departments for explanations as questions arose rather than referring me to someone else and never failed to followup on a question I had In short I could not have made the progress I have without Berts help The report is still being finalized but Marketing and Gas Control have already employed the report with great success in managing Transwestern pipeline activities Incremental gas sales deals were done in June and July utilizing information from the report and the Commercial Support and Financial Accounting groups are looking at the report for ways to employ it in their work Again I just wanted to pass along to you that your team was instrumental in the development of the report and I wanted to give them the appropriate recognition I thought Id better send this now as opposed to waiting for PEP lest I forget I also believe that good news shouldnt wait We dont always hear enough of it Thanks again Ken Powers
