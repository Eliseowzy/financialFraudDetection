UndisclosedRecipientradstupcom Subject Fw GOP Action Plan WHAT YOU CAN DO Original Message From Kenneth R Pybus To Recipient List Suppressed Sent Wednesday November AM Subject Fwd GOP Action Plan WHAT YOU CAN DO I got this from Paul Sperry at WorldNetDaily I dont know who Joe Morris is but this sounds like a plan Note that this has been circulating since last Thursday United Republican Fund of Illinois Chicago November From Joseph A Morris President To URF Leaders and Friends Herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the Florida recount confirms the election of George Bush but Al Gore fails to concede We all know what is going on in Florida and that the election hinges on the outcome I am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what I think is going to happen actually does The recount which will be finished by pm Thursday will likely show Bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted Those ballots will be overwhelmingly for Bush a minimum of and probably closer to If the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election This is when something critical happens Either Gore bows out gracefully or he doesnt and I can almost guarantee he wont These are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming They will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election In when Richard Nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didnt for the sake of the country Expect no such noble behavior this time What will they try One bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the Florida results on a flimsy premise They are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in Palm Beach County I have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least Indeed they are identical in form to the punchcard ballots used in Chicago and Cook County Illinois in this very election What is more it is just as likely that Palm Beach County voters who wanted to vote for Bush inadvertently voted for Nader All parties approved the form of ballot before the election The formofballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the Florida election While I hope this scenario doesnt come to pass I fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country The election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court If this comes to pass the vision of our Founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed Personally I am not going to stand for this and I hope you wont either The good news is that we are not without voice HERE IS WHAT MUST BE DONE if the vote count affirms Bushs election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the Gore camp If they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials AT EVERY LEVEL with phone calls of outrage that demand Gores concession I mean literally millions of phone calls We must jam their phone banks with callsThere are millions of us so it shouldnt be too difficult While youre at it send emails to your local newspapers as well If it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that Gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for Gore to withstand the pressure He will have to relent Here are some places to start The White House telephone FAX email The Vice Presidents Office telephone FAX email Vice Presidents Senate Office telephone Senator Tom Daschle Senate Democratic Leader Also Representative Dick Gephardt House Democratic Leader Also Also be sure to call your congressmen and both your

that of Chicagos Mayor Richard M Daley the brother of Gores campaign manager Bill Daley Telephone FAX If youve never made a call like this theres no reason to be shy They get opinion calls all the

UndisclosedRecipientradstupcom Subject Fw GOP Action Plan WHAT YOU CAN DO Original Message From Kenneth R Pybus To Recipient List Suppressed Sent Wednesday November AM Subject Fwd GOP Action Plan WHAT YOU CAN DO I got this from Paul Sperry at WorldNetDaily I dont know who Joe Morris is but this sounds like a plan Note that this has been circulating since last Thursday United Republican Fund of Illinois Chicago November From Joseph A Morris President To URF Leaders and Friends Herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the Florida recount confirms the election of George Bush but Al Gore fails to concede We all know what is going on in Florida and that the election hinges on the outcome I am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what I think is going to happen actually does The recount which will be finished by pm Thursday will likely show Bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted Those ballots will be overwhelmingly for Bush a minimum of and probably closer to If the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election This is when something critical happens Either Gore bows out gracefully or he doesnt and I can almost guarantee he wont These are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming They will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election In when Richard Nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didnt for the sake of the country Expect no such noble behavior this time What will they try One bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the Florida results on a flimsy premise They are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in Palm Beach County I have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least Indeed they are identical in form to the punchcard ballots used in Chicago and Cook County Illinois in this very election What is more it is just as likely that Palm Beach County voters who wanted to vote for Bush inadvertently voted for Nader All parties approved the form of ballot before the election The formofballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the Florida election While I hope this scenario doesnt come to pass I fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country The election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court If this comes to pass the vision of our Founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed Personally I am not going to stand for this and I hope you wont either The good news is that we are not without voice HERE IS WHAT MUST BE DONE if the vote count affirms Bushs election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the Gore camp If they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials AT EVERY LEVEL with phone calls of outrage that demand Gores concession I mean literally millions of phone calls We must jam their phone banks with callsThere are millions of us so it shouldnt be too difficult While youre at it send emails to your local newspapers as well If it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that Gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for Gore to withstand the pressure He will have to relent Here are some places to start The White House telephone FAX email The Vice Presidents Office telephone FAX email Vice Presidents Senate Office telephone Senator Tom Daschle Senate Democratic Leader Also Representative Dick Gephardt House Democratic Leader Also Also be sure to call your congressmen and both your

maneuver in the book to steal the election In when Richard Nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didnt for the sake of the country Expect no such noble behavior this time What will they try One bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the Florida results on a flimsy premise They are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in Palm Beach County I have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least Indeed they are identical in form to the punchcard ballots used in Chicago and Cook County Illinois in this very election What is more it is just as likely that Palm Beach County voters who wanted to vote for Bush inadvertently voted for Nader All parties approved the form of ballot before the election The formofballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the Florida election While I hope this scenario doesnt come to pass I fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country The election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court If this comes to pass the vision of our Founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed Personally I am not going to stand for this and I hope you wont either The good news is that we are not without voice HERE IS WHAT MUST BE DONE if the vote count affirms Bushs election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the Gore camp If they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials AT EVERY LEVEL with phone calls of outrage that demand Gores concession I mean literally millions of phone calls We must jam their phone banks with callsThere are millions of us so it shouldnt be too difficult While youre at it send emails to your local newspapers as well If it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that Gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for Gore to withstand the pressure He will have to relent Here are some places to start The White House telephone FAX email The Vice Presidents Office telephone FAX email Vice
