cash flow problem and the a rate increase is necessary Due process matters If the Commission is thinking about going as far as ending rate freezes and increasing rates it better provide for ample due process or countless law suits will ensue Dont jump the gun A rate increase is likely but only the utilities benefit from adoption of the utilities proposals The Commission needs to carefully scrutinize the utilities claims and take a careful look at the level of increase required to maintain access to capital markets However as expected the utilities implored the Commission to jump the gun immediately The utilities want the Commission to declare an end to the rate freeze and raise rates on Jan No more divestiture The utility should keep the generating assets it retained but the Commission should ensure that the assets benefits are allocated equally among all customers One legislator recommended that the State buy the utilities hydro assets which would give the utilities the cash they need and give the state control over some generation Treat all customers equally and fairly The Commission should not create two classes of customers eg large v small direct access v bundled No customer group should be sacrificied to save another Be as narrow as possibledo as little harm as possible The immediate problem is the utilitys cashcredit crunch As such the Commission should do only enough to solve this very specific immediate problem A modest rate increase is all thats required and the Commission should do no more At the beginning and the end of the hearing the President of the Commission asked parties to be prepared at tomorrows hearing to discuss whether the Commission could legally use its other broad powers to raise rates without declaring an end to the rate freeze It seems that she seems some benefit in raising rates but leaving AB otherwise intact untill the Commission can Marketers and generators are to blame for the problem Though not universally embraced the theme came up repeatedly A few parties eg the Unions low income consumer groups one PUC commissioner called for complete reregulation of the industry returning the utilities to vertically integrated monopolies But they were the exception rather than the rule at todays hearing Next steps There hearings were scheduled to end on Thursay but now will continue through Friday Tomorrow lawyers will provide oral arguments on whether the Commission must end the rate freeze in order to increase rates We will argue that it does not have to and should not go through the complex and controversial exercise of determing whether the rate freeze is over between now and We will argue that the Commission has the authority to raise rates without ending the rate freeze and if it decides to raise rates it should do so while keeping AB s basic structure in place until a full and fair hearing of the issues is completed We are talking to other stakeholders to persuade them to take the same approach In terms of legal arguments this is clearly a long shot but one that seems worth taking After the oral argument the utilities will present their rate proposals and all interested persons will have the opportunity to crossexamine the utilities in short tomorrow will also be a zoo When asked what the process will be for issuing a proposed decision and providing comments the President of

Hearings Thanks Roger Here are the highlights of todays hearings Common themesmany tracked ours pretty closely Not a question of whether rates need to rise but by how much Though some oppose any and all rate increases the lions share acknowledged that the utilities have a cash flow problem and the a rate increase is necessary Due process matters If the Commission is thinking about going as far as ending rate freezes and increasing rates it better provide for ample due process or countless law suits will ensue Dont jump the gun A rate increase is likely but only the utilities benefit from adoption of the utilities proposals The Commission needs to carefully scrutinize the utilities claims and take a careful look at the level of increase required to maintain access to capital markets However as expected the utilities implored the Commission to jump the gun immediately The utilities want the Commission to declare an end to the rate freeze and raise rates on Jan No more divestiture The utility should keep the generating assets it retained but the Commission should ensure that the assets benefits are allocated equally among all customers One legislator recommended that the State buy the utilities hydro assets which would give the utilities the cash they need and give the state control over some generation Treat all customers equally and fairly The Commission should not create two classes of customers eg large v small direct access v bundled No customer group should be sacrificied to save another Be as narrow as possibledo as little harm as possible The immediate problem is the utilitys cashcredit crunch As such the Commission should do only enough to solve this very specific immediate problem A modest rate increase is all thats required and the Commission should do no more At the beginning and the end of the hearing the President of the Commission asked parties to be prepared at tomorrows hearing to discuss whether the Commission could legally use its other broad powers to raise rates without declaring an end to the rate freeze It seems that she seems some benefit in raising rates but leaving AB otherwise intact untill the Commission can Marketers and generators are to blame for the problem Though not universally embraced the theme came up repeatedly A few parties eg the Unions low income consumer groups one PUC commissioner called for complete reregulation of the industry returning the utilities to vertically integrated monopolies But they were the exception rather than the rule at todays hearing Next steps There hearings were scheduled to end on Thursay but now will continue through Friday Tomorrow lawyers will provide oral arguments on whether the Commission must end the rate freeze in order to increase rates We will argue that it does not have to and should not go through the complex and controversial exercise of determing whether the rate freeze is over between now and We will argue that the Commission has the authority to raise rates without ending the rate freeze and if it decides to raise rates it should do so while keeping AB s basic structure in place until a full and fair hearing of the issues is completed We are talking to other stakeholders to persuade them to take the same approach In terms of legal arguments this is clearly a long shot but one that seems worth taking After the oral argument the utilities will present their rate proposals and all interested persons will have the opportunity to crossexamine the utilities in short tomorrow will also be a zoo When asked what the process will be for issuing a proposed decision and providing comments the President of the Commission responded we dont know its evolving In other words the Commission is doing a poor job of ensuring that their Jan decision is appealproof Keep in mind that the situation remains extremely fluid and the trend is still toward ending the rate freeze on Jan th We continue to aggressively offer alternatives to that possibility and continue to try to bring other stakeholders to our side Were doing everything necessary to preserve our appeal rights We can discuss further on the AM CST call tomorrow Best Jeff Roger
