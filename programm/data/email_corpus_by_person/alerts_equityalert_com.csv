Enable the Next Generation MultiCarrier Transparent Network Architecture With Introduction of Gbps Digital Wrapper and FEC DeviceFDAMCCs Hudson is the Industrys First Device to Meet the Rapidl y Growing Demand for Gbps Digital Wrapper Solutions From the Man Transport and WD M Sectors SAN DIEGO Dec BUSINESS WIRE Applied Micro Circuits Corp AM CC NasdaqAMCC a leader in highbandwidth silicon connectivity solutions fo r the worlds optical networks today announced the Hudson S the industry s first Gbps silicon device architected to support both the evolving G digital wrapper standard and traditional SONETSDH infrastructures The Hudson variable rate digital wrapper framerdeframer and performance monitor device facilitates the transparent transport of multiple protocols across the network while aiding interconnection between multiple carriers Hudson incorporates programmable Forward Error Correction FEC for rates u p to Gbps and supports OC transmission standards The digital wrapper technology provides an extension of the current SONETSDH infrastructure while enhancing both flexibility and transparency across the network The Hudson easily interfaces with AMCCs Gbps muxdemux devices SONETSDHdigital wrapper backplane devices and AMCCs mapping and pointer processing devices The digital wrapper is the next important step for large optical networks as it incorporates the best features of SONETSDH while removing some of the rigi d overhead structure that makes SONETSDH suboptimal for an IPcentric intelligent optical network said Brent Little vice president of marketin g for AMCC By using key devices such as Hudson OEMs will now be able to create more efficient and interoperable systems without starting from scratch AMCCs digital wrapper design has already been adopted by most of the major wide area networking WAN equipment manufacturers The demand for digital wrapp er products stems from the need in the WAN to transparently transport multiple protocols at Gbps coupled with the need to efficiently provision bandwi dth across todays multiplecarrier network The Hudson is built for the nextgeneration multicarrier transport networ k architecture and ushers in an efficient and costeffective means of transporting traffic while extending existing SONET infrastructures said Ken Prentiss AMCCs director of marketing for telecom products We are seeing unprecedented demand for Hudson across a large customer base due mainly to the devices flexible architecture customers can wrap unwrap or monitor traditional SONETSDH traffic or wrap and unwrap IP or any other traffic using a singl e device The digital wrapper concept involves grouping together a number of existing frames into superframes which can then be more efficiently managed with a relatively small allocation of overheadperbyte of data By aggregating together the provisions for framing bits that are already defined for use by existing timedivision multiplexed TDM structures the superframe concep t allows for the implementation of an intelligent operation administration a nd maintenance OAM capability without materially expanding the amount of dat a currently being transmitted This creative use of available control bits al so allows FEC functions to be very efficiently incorporated within the digital wrapper definition without a significant net increase in overall bandwidth usage The Hudsons core logic runs on a V power supply and features two input and two output ports which are configurable in many ways Figure shows a typical network application supporting a single data stream with dual redundant inp ut and output lines The input and output ports can be configured as a dual redundant IO on a single data stream for protection switching or as two completely independent data streams for duplex operation Either input port can be directly connected to either output port for loopback testing The Hudson provides full digital wrapper performance monitoring and feature s Optical Channel Overhead OChOH insertion and extraction which are independently controllable All OChOH bytes in a superframe are programmable in function and are available for insertion from and drop to FPGA or microprocessor Data entering and leaving the Hudson device can be optional ly differentially decoded and encoded deframed and framed descrambled and scrambled and decoded and encoded with FEC information In addition SONET data can optionally be performance monitored for integrity alarms and trace messages Pricing and Availability The Hudson S packaged in a pin

Enable the Next Generation MultiCarrier Transparent Network Architecture With Introduction of Gbps Digital Wrapper and FEC DeviceFDAMCCs Hudson is the Industrys First Device to Meet the Rapidl y Growing Demand for Gbps Digital Wrapper Solutions From the Man Transport and WD M Sectors SAN DIEGO Dec BUSINESS WIRE Applied Micro Circuits Corp AM CC NasdaqAMCC a leader in highbandwidth silicon connectivity solutions fo r the worlds optical networks today announced the Hudson S the industry s first Gbps silicon device architected to support both the evolving G digital wrapper standard and traditional SONETSDH infrastructures The Hudson variable rate digital wrapper framerdeframer and performance monitor device facilitates the transparent transport of multiple protocols across the network while aiding interconnection between multiple carriers Hudson incorporates programmable Forward Error Correction FEC for rates u p to Gbps and supports OC transmission standards The digital wrapper technology provides an extension of the current SONETSDH infrastructure while enhancing both flexibility and transparency across the network The Hudson easily interfaces with AMCCs Gbps muxdemux devices SONETSDHdigital wrapper backplane devices and AMCCs mapping and pointer processing devices The digital wrapper is the next important step for large optical networks as it incorporates the best features of SONETSDH while removing some of the rigi d overhead structure that makes SONETSDH suboptimal for an IPcentric intelligent optical network said Brent Little vice president of marketin g for AMCC By using key devices such as Hudson OEMs will now be able to create more efficient and interoperable systems without starting from scratch AMCCs digital wrapper design has already been adopted by most of the major wide area networking WAN equipment manufacturers The demand for digital wrapp er products stems from the need in the WAN to transparently transport multiple protocols at Gbps coupled with the need to efficiently provision bandwi dth across todays multiplecarrier network The Hudson is built for the nextgeneration multicarrier transport networ k architecture and ushers in an efficient and costeffective means of transporting traffic while extending existing SONET infrastructures said Ken Prentiss AMCCs director of marketing for telecom products We are seeing unprecedented demand for Hudson across a large customer base due mainly to the devices flexible architecture customers can wrap unwrap or monitor traditional SONETSDH traffic or wrap and unwrap IP or any other traffic using a singl e device The digital wrapper concept involves grouping together a number of existing frames into superframes which can then be more efficiently managed with a relatively small allocation of overheadperbyte of data By aggregating together the provisions for framing bits that are already defined for use by existing timedivision multiplexed TDM structures the superframe concep t allows for the implementation of an intelligent operation administration a nd maintenance OAM capability without materially expanding the amount of dat a currently being transmitted This creative use of available control bits al so allows FEC functions to be very efficiently incorporated within the digital wrapper definition without a significant net increase in overall bandwidth usage The Hudsons core logic runs on a V power supply and features two input and two output ports which are configurable in many ways Figure shows a typical network application supporting a single data stream with dual redundant inp ut and output lines The input and output ports can be configured as a dual redundant IO on a single data stream for protection switching or as two completely independent data streams for duplex operation Either input port can be directly connected to either output port for loopback testing The Hudson provides full digital wrapper performance monitoring and feature s Optical Channel Overhead OChOH insertion and extraction which are independently controllable All OChOH bytes in a superframe are programmable in function and are available for insertion from and drop to FPGA or microprocessor Data entering and leaving the Hudson device can be optional ly differentially decoded and encoded deframed and framed descrambled and scrambled and decoded and encoded with FEC information In addition SONET data can optionally be performance monitored for integrity alarms and trace messages Pricing and Availability The Hudson S packaged in a pin

Enable the Next Generation MultiCarrier Transparent Network Architecture With Introduction of Gbps Digital Wrapper and FEC DeviceFDAMCCs Hudson is the Industrys First Device to Meet the Rapidl y Growing Demand for Gbps Digital Wrapper Solutions From the Man Transport and WD M Sectors SAN DIEGO Dec BUSINESS WIRE Applied Micro Circuits Corp AM CC NasdaqAMCC a leader in highbandwidth silicon connectivity solutions fo r the worlds optical networks today announced the Hudson S the industry s first Gbps silicon device architected to support both the evolving G digital wrapper standard and traditional SONETSDH infrastructures The Hudson variable rate digital wrapper framerdeframer and performance monitor device facilitates the transparent transport of multiple protocols across the network while aiding interconnection between multiple carriers Hudson incorporates programmable Forward Error Correction FEC for rates u p to Gbps and supports OC transmission standards The digital wrapper technology provides an extension of the current SONETSDH infrastructure while enhancing both flexibility and transparency across the network The Hudson easily interfaces with AMCCs Gbps muxdemux devices SONETSDHdigital wrapper backplane devices and AMCCs mapping and pointer processing devices The digital wrapper is the next important step for large optical networks as it incorporates the best features of SONETSDH while removing some of the rigi d overhead structure that makes SONETSDH suboptimal for an IPcentric intelligent optical network said Brent Little vice president of marketin g for AMCC By using key devices such as Hudson OEMs will now be able to create more efficient and interoperable systems without starting from scratch AMCCs digital wrapper design has already been adopted by most of the major wide area networking WAN equipment manufacturers The demand for digital wrapp er products stems from the need in the WAN to transparently transport multiple protocols at Gbps coupled with the need to efficiently provision bandwi dth across todays multiplecarrier network The Hudson is built for the nextgeneration multicarrier transport networ k architecture and ushers in an efficient and costeffective means of transporting traffic while extending existing SONET infrastructures said Ken Prentiss AMCCs director of marketing for telecom products We are seeing unprecedented demand for Hudson across a large customer base due mainly to the devices flexible architecture customers can wrap unwrap or monitor traditional SONETSDH traffic or wrap and unwrap IP or any other traffic using a singl e device The digital wrapper concept involves grouping together a number of existing frames into superframes which can then be more efficiently managed with a relatively small allocation of overheadperbyte of data By aggregating together the provisions for framing bits that are already defined for use by existing timedivision multiplexed TDM structures the superframe concep t allows for the implementation of an intelligent operation administration a nd maintenance OAM capability without materially expanding the amount of dat a currently being transmitted This creative use of available control bits al so allows FEC functions to be very efficiently incorporated within the digital wrapper definition without a significant net increase in overall bandwidth usage The Hudsons core logic runs on a V power supply and features two input and two output ports which are configurable in many ways Figure shows a typical network application supporting a single data stream with dual redundant inp ut and output lines The input and output ports can be configured as a dual redundant IO on a single data stream for protection switching or as two completely independent data streams for duplex operation Either input port can be directly connected to either output port for loopback testing The Hudson provides full digital wrapper performance monitoring and feature s Optical Channel Overhead OChOH insertion and extraction which are independently controllable All OChOH bytes in a superframe are programmable in function and are available for insertion from and drop to FPGA or microprocessor Data entering and leaving the Hudson device can be optional ly differentially decoded and encoded deframed and framed descrambled and scrambled and decoded and encoded with FEC information In addition SONET data can optionally be performance monitored for integrity alarms and trace messages Pricing and Availability The Hudson S packaged in a pin
