four key objectives First we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu l business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position Second we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships Particularly with Joe Suttons departure the ability to directly manage the daytoday activities of independent business units has become increasingly difficult Third we need to accomplish these changes without in any way compromisin g the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our loweryieldin g asset positions And fourth as always we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES Today we are forming Enron Wholesale Services EWS which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses The closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following enhanced communication and coordination across business units more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business and more rapid extension o f Enrons wholesale business model and
