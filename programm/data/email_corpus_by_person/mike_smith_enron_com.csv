<33348769.1075848137438.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mike.smith@enron.com,2001-02-12 07:48:00,Hearing on SCE Federal Court Case Cc for preliminary injunction seeking an order permitting recoupment of past and future undercollections was denied today It appears that the case will now be scheduled for a future hearing after the parties have had a chance to develop any relevant facts and fully brief the legal issues Below is a summary of what occurred today Motion for Preliminary Injunction The Court denied SCEs Motion for a Preliminary Injunction on the merits Judge Lew stated that the Motion was wholly inappropriate and that granting it would violate the th Amendment The Court stated that mandatory injunctions such as the one requested here are strongly disfavored and involve a heightened standard that SCE failed to meet The Court also said it was constrained by the matters put at issue in the pleadings and that here the Motion sought relief in excess of that requested in the complaint While the Court let defense counsel argue for about minutes he mostly appeared disinterested in what they were saying Plaintiffs counsel did not make any oral argument The Court also said that this case turns on the Pike County exception which depends on whether there were alternative markets available and that if the exception applies there is no preemption claim The Court said that there were certain narrow issues before it which is all that it will address and that the Court is not a do it all problem solver for the parties The Court did not indicate whether it was predisposed to rule for any side Motion for Order Specifying Facts without Substantial Controversy The Court granted the motion as to facts and denied it as to facts The Court found that these particular facts were not substantially disputed by the defendants and that further discovery was not needed for the Court to determine them Since I do not have a copy of the filings I am unable to provide further comment Please let me know if you want me to obtain copies of the filings Motions to Intervene The Court granted the Motions to Intervene permissive intervention filed by Los Angeles County and the Utility Reform Network on the ground that their participation would assist the court in hearing the complex matters presented Motion to Specially Appear The Court denied the California Attorney Generals motion to specially appear as inappropriate but without prejudice to filing a motion for permissive intervention Criticism of Counsel The Judge castigated SCEs counsel in several instances He called the preliminary injunction motion wholly inappropriate He criticized SCEs description in briefs of his ruling on January which the Judge said was flatly wrong He said his January order did not hold that the filed rate doctrine permits the plaintiff to recover recoupment costs With respect to the Motion for Order Specifying Facts he said he was not fooled by SCEs creative arguments The Court also gave a general admonishment about spinning his rulings outside of the courtroom Reading between the lines the Judge seemed bothered by media reports I do not know if the Judge was aware but SCE had a public relations person mingling in the court room with the many reporters present Calendar The Court advanced the March Scheduling Conference to March at The Conference will address matters including discovery practice motion deadlines and the trial date The Judge said he would consider SCEs request for an early trial date However he also said that it appeared that the primary disputed issues were legal not factual and therefore he expected that summary judgment motions would be filed by both sides Consolidation with PGE matter The Court initially expressed concern that the PGE case was transferred from Northern California saying he had doubts that this was the proper venue Later however the Judge seemed placated when PGEs counsel told him that the company had substantial assets in this district One counsel also told the Court that the parties had stipulated to consolidate the PGE matter with the SCE matter though the Court did not say whether he would order consolidation Impression of Judge This was my first time observing Judge Lew He seems extremely strict straightforward and nononsense He seemed very well prepared on the substance and not at all shy about ruling on the merits In the SCE matter and preceding nonrelated matters the Judge frequently cutoff counsels arguments to focus on narrow issues of law and made counsel either answer very specific questions or stop talking completely Here the Judge acknowledged this cases importance and said he does not take this matter lightly

Manager of State Policy Affairs Independent Energy Producers Association Contact Corporate Communications World Wide Web Address Southern California Edison Applauds Court Findings in Lawsuit Against CPUC Southern California Edison Company SCE today released the following statement in response to todays expedited decision by the US District Court upholding the utilitys right to recover the costs of purchasing power for its customers ROSEMEAD Calif Jan SCE applauded todays decision by US District Court Judge Ronald SW Lew upholding the central claim of our lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission CPUCour right to recover the reasonable costs of purchasing power for our customers This ruling is an important step toward rebuilding the financial stability of Californias electric power system The court found that a trial is needed on the question of whether SCEs purchases were prudent We believe we will prevail on that issue too because the CPUC has repeatedly held that purchases made through Californias Power Exchange and Independent System Operator are by definition reasonable We will work with the CPUC to implement a schedule for the reasonable recovery of our costs We filed the lawsuit on Nov asking the federal court to overturn rulings by the CPUC that illegally prevent it from the reasonable recovery of operating costs for purchasing power it has been forced to incur on behalf of our customers We believe that the five members of the commission violated federal law when after requiring us to procure wholesale power for its customers from the states newly deregulated wholesale market and to sell it without markup the commission blocked us from recovering the full cost of doing so Our lawsuit was made necessary by the commissions refusal over the past eight months to heed warnings that its policies breach federal law and unfairly place the company and our customers in jeopardy In the lawsuit we noted that we incurred undercollections the difference between outofcontrol wholesale power costs and frozen retail rates approaching billion that have seriously weakened our financial integrity and service reliability This suit is one of many steps we are taking to attempt to remedy serious market problems that threaten the ability of the states major utilities to continue serving their customers We are pursuing every possible means of protecting our customers and shareholders from Californias dysfunctional electricity market An Edison International company Southern California Edison is one of the nations largest electric utilities serving a population of more than million via million customer accounts in a squaremile service area within central coastal and Southern California

<18333885.1075843356641.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mike.smith@enron.com,2001-02-12 07:48:00,Hearing on SCE Federal Court Case Cc for preliminary injunction seeking an order permitting recoupment of past and future undercollections was denied today It appears that the case will now be scheduled for a future hearing after the parties have had a chance to develop any relevant facts and fully brief the legal issues Below is a summary of what occurred today Motion for Preliminary Injunction The Court denied SCEs Motion for a Preliminary Injunction on the merits Judge Lew stated that the Motion was wholly inappropriate and that granting it would violate the th Amendment The Court stated that mandatory injunctions such as the one requested here are strongly disfavored and involve a heightened standard that SCE failed to meet The Court also said it was constrained by the matters put at issue in the pleadings and that here the Motion sought relief in excess of that requested in the complaint While the Court let defense counsel argue for about minutes he mostly appeared disinterested in what they were saying Plaintiffs counsel did not make any oral argument The Court also said that this case turns on the Pike County exception which depends on whether there were alternative markets available and that if the exception applies there is no preemption claim The Court said that there were certain narrow issues before it which is all that it will address and that the Court is not a do it all problem solver for the parties The Court did not indicate whether it was predisposed to rule for any side Motion for Order Specifying Facts without Substantial Controversy The Court granted the motion as to facts and denied it as to facts The Court found that these particular facts were not substantially disputed by the defendants and that further discovery was not needed for the Court to determine them Since I do not have a copy of the filings I am unable to provide further comment Please let me know if you want me to obtain copies of the filings Motions to Intervene The Court granted the Motions to Intervene permissive intervention filed by Los Angeles County and the Utility Reform Network on the ground that their participation would assist the court in hearing the complex matters presented Motion to Specially Appear The Court denied the California Attorney Generals motion to specially appear as inappropriate but without prejudice to filing a motion for permissive intervention Criticism of Counsel The Judge castigated SCEs counsel in several instances He called the preliminary injunction motion wholly inappropriate He criticized SCEs description in briefs of his ruling on January which the Judge said was flatly wrong He said his January order did not hold that the filed rate doctrine permits the plaintiff to recover recoupment costs With respect to the Motion for Order Specifying Facts he said he was not fooled by SCEs creative arguments The Court also gave a general admonishment about spinning his rulings outside of the courtroom Reading between the lines the Judge seemed bothered by media reports I do not know if the Judge was aware but SCE had a public relations person mingling in the court room with the many reporters present Calendar The Court advanced the March Scheduling Conference to March at The Conference will address matters including discovery practice motion deadlines and the trial date The Judge said he would consider SCEs request for an early trial date However he also said that it appeared that the primary disputed issues were legal not factual and therefore he expected that summary judgment motions would be filed by both sides Consolidation with PGE matter The Court initially expressed concern that the PGE case was transferred from Northern California saying he had doubts that this was the proper venue Later however the Judge seemed placated when PGEs counsel told him that the company had substantial assets in this district One counsel also told the Court that the parties had stipulated to consolidate the PGE matter with the SCE matter though the Court did not say whether he would order consolidation Impression of Judge This was my first time observing Judge Lew He seems extremely strict straightforward and nononsense He seemed very well prepared on the substance and not at all shy about ruling on the merits In the SCE matter and preceding nonrelated matters the Judge frequently cutoff counsels arguments to focus on narrow issues of law and made counsel either answer very specific questions or stop talking completely Here the Judge acknowledged this cases importance and said he does not take this matter lightly

<24629256.1075843737386.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mike.smith@enron.com,2001-02-12 07:48:00,Hearing on SCE Federal Court Case Cc for preliminary injunction seeking an order permitting recoupment of past and future undercollections was denied today It appears that the case will now be scheduled for a future hearing after the parties have had a chance to develop any relevant facts and fully brief the legal issues Below is a summary of what occurred today Motion for Preliminary Injunction The Court denied SCEs Motion for a Preliminary Injunction on the merits Judge Lew stated that the Motion was wholly inappropriate and that granting it would violate the th Amendment The Court stated that mandatory injunctions such as the one requested here are strongly disfavored and involve a heightened standard that SCE failed to meet The Court also said it was constrained by the matters put at issue in the pleadings and that here the Motion sought relief in excess of that requested in the complaint While the Court let defense counsel argue for about minutes he mostly appeared disinterested in what they were saying Plaintiffs counsel did not make any oral argument The Court also said that this case turns on the Pike County exception which depends on whether there were alternative markets available and that if the exception applies there is no preemption claim The Court said that there were certain narrow issues before it which is all that it will address and that the Court is not a do it all problem solver for the parties The Court did not indicate whether it was predisposed to rule for any side Motion for Order Specifying Facts without Substantial Controversy The Court granted the motion as to facts and denied it as to facts The Court found that these particular facts were not substantially disputed by the defendants and that further discovery was not needed for the Court to determine them Since I do not have a copy of the filings I am unable to provide further comment Please let me know if you want me to obtain copies of the filings Motions to Intervene The Court granted the Motions to Intervene permissive intervention filed by Los Angeles County and the Utility Reform Network on the ground that their participation would assist the court in hearing the complex matters presented Motion to Specially Appear The Court denied the California Attorney Generals motion to specially appear as inappropriate but without prejudice to filing a motion for permissive intervention Criticism of Counsel The Judge castigated SCEs counsel in several instances He called the preliminary injunction motion wholly inappropriate He criticized SCEs description in briefs of his ruling on January which the Judge said was flatly wrong He said his January order did not hold that the filed rate doctrine permits the plaintiff to recover recoupment costs With respect to the Motion for Order Specifying Facts he said he was not fooled by SCEs creative arguments The Court also gave a general admonishment about spinning his rulings outside of the courtroom Reading between the lines the Judge seemed bothered by media reports I do not know if the Judge was aware but SCE had a public relations person mingling in the court room with the many reporters present Calendar The Court advanced the March Scheduling Conference to March at The Conference will address matters including discovery practice motion deadlines and the trial date The Judge said he would consider SCEs request for an early trial date However he also said that it appeared that the primary disputed issues were legal not factual and therefore he expected that summary judgment motions would be filed by both sides Consolidation with PGE matter The Court initially expressed concern that the PGE case was transferred from Northern California saying he had doubts that this was the proper venue Later however the Judge seemed placated when PGEs counsel told him that the company had substantial assets in this district One counsel also told the Court that the parties had stipulated to consolidate the PGE matter with the SCE matter though the Court did not say whether he would order consolidation Impression of Judge This was my first time observing Judge Lew He seems extremely strict straightforward and nononsense He seemed very well prepared on the substance and not at all shy about ruling on the merits In the SCE matter and preceding nonrelated matters the Judge frequently cutoff counsels arguments to focus on narrow issues of law and made counsel either answer very specific questions or stop talking completely Here the Judge acknowledged this cases importance and said he does not take this matter lightly

CPUC Southern California Edison Company SCE today released the following statement in response to todays expedited decision by the US District Court upholding the utilitys right to recover the costs of purchasing power for its customers ROSEMEAD Calif Jan SCE applauded todays decision by US District Court Judge Ronald SW Lew upholding the central claim of our lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission CPUCour right to recover the reasonable costs of purchasing power for our customers This ruling is an important step toward rebuilding the financial stability of Californias electric power system The court found that a trial is needed on the question of whether SCEs purchases were prudent We believe we will prevail on that issue too because the CPUC has repeatedly held that purchases made through Californias Power Exchange and Independent System Operator are by definition reasonable We will work with the CPUC to implement a schedule for the reasonable recovery of our costs We filed the lawsuit on Nov asking the federal court to overturn rulings by the CPUC that illegally prevent it from the reasonable recovery of operating costs for purchasing power it has been forced to incur on behalf of our customers We believe that the five members of the commission violated federal law when after requiring us to procure wholesale power for its customers from the states newly deregulated wholesale market and to sell it without markup the commission blocked us from recovering the full cost of doing so Our lawsuit was made necessary by the commissions refusal over the past eight months to heed warnings that its policies breach federal law and unfairly place the company and our customers in jeopardy In the lawsuit we noted that we incurred undercollections the difference between outofcontrol wholesale power costs and frozen retail rates approaching billion that have seriously weakened our financial integrity and service reliability This suit is one of many steps we are taking to attempt to remedy serious market problems that threaten the ability of the states major utilities to continue serving their customers We are pursuing every possible means of protecting our customers and shareholders from Californias dysfunctional electricity market An Edison International company Southern California Edison is one of the nations largest electric utilities serving a population of more than million via million customer accounts in a squaremile service area within central coastal and Southern California
