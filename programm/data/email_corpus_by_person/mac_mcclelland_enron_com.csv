somewhat behind schedule This combined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in Gaza and the first by a major Western company anywhere in Palestine There are several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the Secretarys visit All equipment for the plant must transit Israel We have been assured by the Israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it is on the list of equipment we provide them That said there are countless opportunities for equipment to be delayed in Israel awaiting clearance whether on the list or not First power could be delayed indefinitely if the Israelis choose to do so for political security or other reasons Fuel for the plant once operational will also transit Israel Again disruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the plug on power in Gaza Gas from Egypt has been discussed it remains to be seen if that will be a reality anytime soon Although not officially from the Israeli government we have been told that as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced the Israelis will turn off supply of electricity to Gaza The current consumption is about MW The first phase of the plant will produce MW This appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby Israel sells Gaza electricity to make up the difference That electricity is likely to be more expensive than that which the plant will supply Enron could well end up being blamed for the higher cost Water is another critical issue The Palestinians want their own supply of fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated Israel is currently selling water to Gaza it is not in Israels best interest to lose this customer therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project OPIC project funding is problematical Since they originally invited Enron to take on this project they should necessarily also be involved Lack of OPIC support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up costs The Israelis must also approve the environmental impact of the plant The plant will meet or exceed World Bank guidelines more so when operating on gas While not a probem at this point the Israelis could delay constructionoperation over environmental concerns Andrew is the lead developer for this project and may have other issues for consideration Thanks Mac Forwarded by Mac
