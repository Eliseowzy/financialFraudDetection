Be Lengthybut good reading Zetra M Williams MSgt USAF DISA Defensive Information Operations Sr Analyst DSN CMCL Subject FW How Tarnished Will Your Handle Be The Room beware this is really powerful In that place between wakefulness and dreams I found myself in the room There were no distinguishing features except for the one wall covered with small index card files They were like the ones in libraries that list titles by author or subject in alphabetical order But these files which stretched from floor to ceiling and seemingly endlessly in either direction had very different headings As I drew near the wall of files the first to catch my attention was one that read Girls I have liked I opened it and began flipping through the cards I quickly shut it shocked to realize that I recognized the names written on each one And then without being told I knew exactly where I was This lifeless room with its small files was a crude catalog system for my life Here were written the actions of my every moment big and small in a detail my memory couldnt match A sense of wonder and curiosity coupled with horror stirred within me as I began randomly opening files and exploring their content Some brought joy and sweet memories others a sense of shame and regret so intense that I would look over my shoulder to see if anyone was watching A file named Friends was next to one marked Friends I have betrayed The titles ranged from the mundane to the outright weird Books I Have Read Lies I Have Told Comfort I have GivenJokes I Have Laughed at Some were almost hilarious in their exactness Things Ive yelled at my brothers Others I couldnt laugh at Things I Have Done in My Anger Things I Have Muttered Under My Breath at My Parents I never ceased to be surprised by the contents Often there were many more cards than I expected Sometimes fewer than I hoped I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the life I had lived Could it be possible that I had the time in my years to write each of these thousands or even millions of cards Each card confirmed this truth Each was written in my own handwriting Each signed with my signature When I pulled out the file marked Songs I have listened to I realized the files grew to contain their contents The cards were packed tightly and yet after two or three yards I hadnt found the end of the file I shut it shamed not so much by the quality of music but more by the vast amount of time I knew that file represented When I came to a file marked Lustful Thoughts I felt a chill run through my body I pulled the file out only an inch not willing to test its size and drew out a card I shuddered at its detailed content I felt sick to think that such a moment had been recorded An almost animal rage broke on me One thought dominated my mind No one must ever see these cards No one must ever see this room I have to destroy them In insane frenzy I yanked the file out Its size didnt mattered now I had to empty it and burn the cards As I took it at one end and began pounding it on the floor I could not dislodge a single card I became desperate and pulled out a card only to find it as strong as steel when I tried to tear it Defeated and utterly helpless I returned the file to its slot Leaning my forehead against the wall I let out a long selfpitying sigh Then I saw it The title bore People I Have Shared the Gospel With The handle was brighter than those around it newer almost unused I pulled on its handle and a small box not more than three inches long fell into my hands I could count the cards it contained on one hand Then the tears came I began to weep Sobs so deep that the hurt started in my stomach and shook through me I fell on my knees and cried I cried out of shame from the overwhelming shame of it all The rows of file shelves swirled in my tearfilled eyes No one must ever ever know of this room I must lock it up and hide the key But then as I pushed away the tears I saw Him No please not Him Not here Oh anyone but Jesus I watched helplessly as He began to open the files and read the cards I couldnt bear to watch His response In the moments I could bring myself to look at His face I saw a sorrow deeper than my own He seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes Why did He have to read every one Finally He turned and looked at me from across the room He looked at me with pity in His eyes But this was a pity that didnt anger me I dropped my head covered my face with my hands and began to cry again He walked over and put His arm around me He could have said so many things But He didnt say a word He just cried with me Then He got up and walked back to the wall of files Starting at one end of the room He took out a file and one by one began to sign His name over mine on each card No I shouted rushing to Him All I could find to say was No no as I pulled the card from Him His name shouldnt be on these cards But there it was written in red so rich so dark so alive The name of Jesus covered mine It was written with His blood He gently took the card back He smiled a sad smile and began to sign the cards I dont think Ill ever understand how He did it so quickly but the next instant it seemed I heard Him close the last file and walk back to my side He placed His hand on my shoulder and said It is finished I stood up and He led me out of the room There was no lock on its door There were still cards to be written For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved John If you feel the same way forward it to as many people as you can so the love of Jesus will touch their lives also My People I shared the Gospel with file just got bigger how about yours
