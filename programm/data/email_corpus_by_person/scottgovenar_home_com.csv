<12461207.1075852563153.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,scottgovenar@home.com,2001-09-25 06:55:53,Sacramento BeeAttached please find an article from todays Sacramento Bee regarding the SCE MOU as well as a terrific editorial from Daniel Weintraub regarding direct access Californians oppose Edison deal poll finds By Amy Chance Bee Political Editor Published Sept Californians by large margins oppose Gov Gray Davis proposal to use statebacked bonds to prevent Southern California Edison from slipping into bankruptcy according to a Field Poll released Monday Overall the new poll found that Californians concern about the electricity shortage has eased considerably They give themselves credit for proving power blackout predictions wrong with strong conservation efforts But they are in no mood as taxpayers or ratepayers to help bolster the finances of a key investorowned utility The poll noted that Edison is in danger of declaring bankruptcy and asked those surveyed whether to avoid this possibility they supported a proposal in which Edison would issue billion in statebacked bonds to be repaid by its customers over time Adults statewide opposed the idea percent to percent registered voters were against it percent to percent Pollster Mark DiCamillo noted that a large majority of Southern California Edisons own customers percent were opposed to the plan One factor he said may be the publics view of bankruptcy With PGE in bankruptcy nothing has really changed for PGE customers he said That may have some influence on their attitudes The Democratic governor has sought for months to gain legislative support for a plan to prevent Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co into bankruptcy court arguing that the states ability to get out of the powerbuying business depends on the effort But the Legislature adjourned Sept without taking final action on a plan Consumer groups argued vigorously against what they termed a bailout and some lawmakers said they didnt see the proposal as a better alternative than bankruptcy Davis threatened to call lawmakers back to the Capitol to address the issue within two weeks angering Senate President Pro Tem John Burton Both the governor and Burton have since said they intend to negotiate before asking legislators to return DiCamillo said the numbers indicate that Davis is pursuing an unpopular path that could affect his own reelection effort If he continues to pursue it and all indications are that hes going to hes expending more of his own political capital on an issue that is clearly not very popular DiCamillo said He may wish to do that Some people say thats how you define leadership when you take your own personal stances because you think they are in the public interest not what people think at the time But some of the medicine hes prescribing is unpalatable And some of the Democrats in the Legislature have called him on it and said Were not going to go for this Were running for reelection too A Davis adviser said the findings were no surprise Utilities arent popular Thats the reality said Davis political consultant Garry South In May amid predictions that the state would spend the summer suffering through blackouts percent of Californians saw the situation as very serious That number dropped in the latest poll to percent Asked to rate the efforts of various groups and officials to improve Californias energy outlook residential energy consumers put themselves at the top of the list with percent saying they have done a very good or good job Californians also saw industry and business as willing to pitch in as percent described their efforts as good or very good They gave higher poor marks meanwhile to a long list of others Davis the Legislature President Bush the state Public Utilities Commission the states private utilities outofstate energy providers and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission And about half said they continue to see rate increases that hit earlier this year as very or somewhat serious and expect rates in their area to rise even more in the next months If you asked them to rate how they got out of this situation theyd say we got ourselves out of it by cutting back the politicians didnt help much the regulatory agencies didnt help much DiCamillo said But theyre still irritated because rates have gone up and they expect them to go up further Daniel Weintraub Now its illegal to purchase your own electricity Published Sept Buying your own has been banned in California Electricity on the open market is now officially contraband Like prescription drugs which you can get only from a licensed pharmacy electricity is something you can buy from your local utility which can make its own or buy it from the state Beyond that its an illegal substance It was the grand hope of a deregulated electricity industry that you and I and the factory down the street would be able to buy our own juice from the lowest bidder It might have been a pain kind of like shopping for telephone service But just as breaking up Ma Bell spawned great leaps in mobile phone technology busting the utility monopoly was supposed to usher in a new era for electricity Not that there were mobs of shopkeepers and apartment dwellers lobbying the Legislature for consumer choice It was the biggest users who really wanted to cut their own deals Under the old regulated system the huge factories that make steel and cement and computers and gobble up electricity by the megawatt were paying percent more than their competitors in other states They wanted the right to shop around The Legislature agreed but only to a point Lawmakers permitted choice but they rigged the new system in its early years to favor the utilities that were a powerful force in the Capitol They made it nearly impossible for the private generators to undercut the utilities pricing and they put roadblocks in the way of cities that might have gathered their small customers together and used their market clout to negotiate for lower rates The government spent millions on an advertising campaign trying to persuade us of the wisdom of buying our own energy But there werent really many deals to be had Now there are none Consumer choice died a quiet death last week at the hands of the Public Utility Commission Its demise was collateral damage from the mess that was Californias experiment in electricity deregulation Choice couldnt survive because the state which now controls the energy business cant cope with the competition If Californians were allowed to buy their own electricity pretty soon most of us would figure out that we are getting a rotten deal from the state As more people left the state system the few that remained would have to pay higher and higher rates to keep the books balanced Eventually the whole thing would collapse of its own weight Were in this fix because Gov Gray Davis when he stepped in to buy electricity on behalf of the failing utilities in January went too far Craving stability at any price Davis bought almost all the energy the state will need for the next few years and much of what well need for a decade And he bought that electricity at the top of the market paying prices that had never been so high and might never be again As those prices were passed along to consumers suddenly choosing your own electricity supplier got more attractive than ever Thousands of businesses jumped at the opportunity Among them were the big steel factories in the Inland Empire region east of Los Angeles Tamco Steel of Rancho Cucamonga which makes rebar realized its annual electricity bill was going to climb from million to million if it stayed with the local utility Southern California Edison according to a report in the Riverside PressEnterprise The company which just laid off people onefourth of its workers desperately started searching for cheaper energy It signed a deal with a private supplier on Sept just days before the state slammed the door shut on such opportunities Thats a scenario that was repeated up and down the state all summer and it illustrates why in the twisted world of electricity regulation the Public Utilities Commission had to step in and just say no Without the ban there would have been a jailbreak in the words of one commissioner leaving small customers or the taxpayers holding the bag That decision might have been unavoidable given the circumstances But it didnt have to be this way Davis could have swallowed hard and ridden out the storm earlier this year He could have signed electricity contracts for shorter terms at higher prices That would have been painful financially and politically but once the crisis passed Californians would have been free again to set their own course Instead we are imprisoned in a highpriced staterun system and will be for years to come California in fact is worse off than it was in when companies stuck with high utility rates first asked for the freedom to buy their own electricity This does not seem like an unreasonable request an act that should be against the law Yet now it is The real crime though is the state bungling that destroyed the electricity industry
