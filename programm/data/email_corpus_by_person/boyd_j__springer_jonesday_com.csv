If you are not the intended recipient please do not read copy use or disclose this communication to others also please notify the sender by replying to this message and then delete it from your system Thank you The following discusses the regulatory issues raised at our June meeting with Peoples Expanded termination right for unacceptable Regulatory Approval As discussed prior to the meeting language of Sects and f was changed to provide a termination right in the event that an unacceptable regulatory order is issued after initial approval of the Agency Agreement but during its term Peoples explained at the meeting their view that a termination right should exist in the event of an adverse rate order eg Illinois Commission order imputing what Peoples believes to be an unreasonably high level of Hub revenue and therefore unaccpetably lowering retail gas rates or FERC determination that based on Hub operations Peoples is in jeopardy of losing its status as a Hinshaw pipeline These were examples of the types of orders Peoples has in mind As proposed in our draft either party would have a termination right in the event that the Agency Agreement is not initially approved by the ICC on acceptable terms Under our approach however the parties would have to live with later adverse regulatory orders unless an order had the effect of revoking the Hubs operating authority My view is that we could reasonably agree to a termination right similar to Sect vi and vii of the LLC Agreement which grants a termination right in the event that a Jugment determines that as a result of Hub Transactions Peoples is subject to comprehensive rate regulation as a natural gas company or public utility by the FERC or loses its status as an exempt Hinshaw pipeline under Section c of the Natural Gas Act I would suggest that we otherwise stay with our original language re regulatory approvals Once Peoples obtains an order from the ICC which both parties accept Peoples should be willing to assume the risk whichin my opinion is minimal that an adverse rate decision would cause it to wish to terminate the Agency Agreement David suggested at the meeting that as another option we could agree to a termination right due to an adverse regulatory order if Peoples chooses to discontinue all Hub Transactions but I am not sure that we need to offer this at this stage The word required should be restored to Definitions and Extended Hub Services Peoples agreed at the meeting that there should be compensation after termination of the Agreement for an extended Hub Service presented during the Agreements term To make this clearthe words during the term of this Agreement should be deleted from Sect ii The deleted wording of should be restored and to that Section we could add a sentence The right to compensation established under Section ii for an Extended Hub Service shall survive the termination of this Agreement Also in Section I believe the reference to Sect should be to Hub ServicesSect Based on discussion at the meeting I understand that there is a need to address the two county rule in the Agreement In connection with this there was discussion of the need to change the description of the Hub Services to make clear that the services are incidental to the primary uses of the Hub Facilities As I understand it the description of the services both for the Agreement and the GTC may be changed to replace the existing references to transportation services a reference to wheeling serivces This should be addressed when the revised terms of the GTC are available I believe the business people also are discussing a procedure for approval of transactions to ensure compliance with the two county rule and are preparing a list of types of transactions which will be preapproved Adjustment of Administrative fee for refunds Our position as discussed at the meeting is that Sect which provides for retroactive adjustment of the administrative fee in the event of a refund should be deleted In support we point out that MEH relies on a specific fee value in seeking out transactions and the fee shouldnt change afterthefact as the result of a refund Peoples argues that a revenuebased fee should be adjusted if there is a change in the realized level of revenue This was left as an open point Peoples acknowledged at the meeting that the proposed fee adjustment would occur only due to a rate refund This means that the administrative fee could be adjusted retroactively only if a transaction occurs under a newly proposed rate which is part of the Operating Statement but subject to refund at a level higher than the previously approved rate but lower than the maximum price under the new rate The only portion of the fee which is at risk is the portion produced by use of a rate above the previously approved level If for example a increase is proposed and made effective subject to refund A risk arises only if the negotiated price is at of the maximum or above If it is the refund risk to MEH is its percentage of the revenue produced by the rate above the above If the rate is of the maximum the amount at risk is of MEHs portion of the revenue or of the fee A refund at this level would occur in the example only if FERC approves no rate increase and requires a refund of all subject to refund revenue If FERC approves all or part of the increase the refund risk is reduced Therefore the decision should not greatly effect the economics of the deal If we decide to allow some adjustment of the fee for refunds the language should make clear that we are including only refunds related to a finding by FERC that a rate in effect subject to refund is excessive and should be reduced Also with respect to refunds required for any cause Peoples agreed at the meeting to provide the necessary funds We could adjust the language of Sect to read Peoples will pay to MEH all funds necessary to effect such refunds on or before the earlier of i the date prescribed by a Law or Judgment for payment of such refunds or ii ten business days after receiving written notice of the need for such payment Note Because refunds are required by FERC Order Peoples would always know when the refund has to be paid Admin Fee After the business discussion of intended coverage of the monthly fixed fee we should reconsider the deleted language in regarding reimbursement of costs incurred by MEH on Peoples behalf Nomination and Scheduling on Pipelines Sect Peoples proposes to delete the language we added which requires Peoples to make any necessary nominating or scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt and delivery of gas at its city gate for its own account in order to effectuate Hub transactions The language went on to also require Peoples to arrange for delivery of gas at a secondary delivery point by Displacement Delivery At the meeting Peoples took the position that it is already required to handle nominations and scheduling on pipelines by terms of the GTC Peoples also indicated that due to the nature of the Hub Facilities and transactions the Delivery Points must be on Peoples system and that Displacement Delivery to a point which Peoples can access under one of its pipeline agreements is not feasible for a Hub Serivce Note In the Northern Illinois Gas Hub Agreement the utility agreed to the provision we proposed With regard to the second part of our proposed sentence re delivery by displacement at a secondary point offsystem I agree that the GTC seems to contemplate delivery on Peoples system for the various types of transactions covered Perhaps we can delete section b of our proposed sentence I would like to know whether the business people have comments on this With regard to the part a the requirement that Peoples make nominanting and scheduling changes needed to effectuate Hub transactions however I do not find any language in the GTC which makes clear that this is Peoples responsibility Also at our preliminary meeting Laura indicated that this was an important provision to restore I believe Laura mentioned only part a but need to check this Therefore I believe we should propose at least to restore the sentence through part a subject to verification with Laura and Gregg Grounds to Refuse Trransaction Also in Peoples included as one of the grounds to refuse a Hub Service presented by MEH a conclusion by Peoples that Hub Capacity is deemed unavailable by Peoples due to the service requirements of Peoples utility customers We pointed out at the meeting that the GTC Sect specifies all circumstances when a Hub Serivce can be refused and that this provision is not one of the specified situations Once a firm transaction is established under the GTC it has equal scheduling priority with other firm interstate and intrastate firm transactions Peopels agreed that this item Item can be deleted I believe Peoples wishes to revise to read permitted by the terms of the GTC or required by any Law and Judment Sect Peoples proposes to delete our proposed Section which requires Peoples to use its best efforts to minimize imbalances experienced by Hub Shippers through use of management services offered under pipeline tariffs Such services should be offered soon under Order compliance filings This provision was inserted as part of a paragraph in Peoples initial draft which would have required MEH to compensate Peoples for imbalances experienced on pieplines as a result of Hub Transactions Peoples had taken this provision from the NIGAS Hub agreement In response we had included the wording of to at least require best efforts to minimize imbalances on the pipelines Peoples now proposes to delete all of this on the ground that imbalances on the pipelines are the responsibility of the Hub Shippers and not of Peoples or MEH The GTC has provisions covering the responsibility of shippers to address imbalances on the Hub Facilities and Peoples points to the Parking and Loaning Service for Shippers to address imbalances In reviewin g this I believe Peoples is right Because the language requiring MEH to address imbalnaces on the pieplines has been deleted I think we can delete the language of requiring Peoples to use best efforts to minimize those imbalances Sect Responsibility for regulatory compliance Peoples proposed changes to the language we inserted in in the second sentence from the end which indicated that Peoples is responsible for compliance with the GTC Peoples proposed that each party be responsible At the meeting we explained that this language was included to recognize FERC precedent requiring that in circumstances such as this the agreement must identify the party responsible for regulatory complaince and that party must be the certificate holder Peoples agreed at the meeting that our original language for this sentence should be restored The Agreement presently provides that Peoples in its sole discretion may propose changes in the GTC David indicated at the meeting that at a minimum MEH should be advised of changes in advance and provided with an opportunity for comments before such changes are proposed Peoples agreed to include such a provision Also Peoples agreed that Section should include a representation that Peoples has provided MEH with a current copy of the presently effective GTC Section GTC Peoples agreed at the meeting that the definition of GTC should be changed to end after the words from time to time This eliminates the refernce to modification in Peoples sole discretion Section and Peoples agreed that the definitions should refer only to MEH and Peoples and not to controlled persons Section Peoples agreed that the definition of Hub Capacity could be changed to eliminate the reference to determination by Peoples in its sole discretion The determination should be in accordance with the GTC Peoples suggested that a standard of good faith or commercially reasonable would be acceptable Section Peoples agreed at the meeting that Section could be revised to eliminate the refernce to Laws and Judgments with a materially adverse effect Peoples agrees that there should be a representation that the Agreement does n ot violate any Judgment or Law applicable to itas originally proposed Section The discussion at the meeting indicated that Peoples may accept use of a standard of commercially reasonable with regard to its judgment under i and MEHs obligation to perform in accordance with the Operating Statement Laws and Judgments in ii I was surprised that Peoples suggested this re As I understand it the concern is that MEH should not be liable for contract damages in the event that it acts in a commercially reasonable manner but cannot for some reason comply with the GTC or a Law or Judgment I wonder if we can accomplish this result with language in a later section of the Agreement regarding liability My concern is that a provision indicating that MEHs responsibility for compliance with regualtory requirements Laws and Judgments is limited to best efforts or items it knows about may raise a red flag for the regulators I would like to discuss whether there is another way to deal with potential liability without changing ii to refer to best or commercially reasonable efforts Lets discuss tomorrow Section Filing for Governmental Approval At the meeting Peoples indicated that although it believes it should have sole control over regulatory filings Peoples will agree to include a provision indicating thatPrior to the filing of applications pleadings or testimony related to approval for operation of the Hub Peoples will provide copies of such materials to MEH and consider comments provided by MEH We should discuss with the business peoples whether this is sufficient and how specific this provision should be The language here would be comparable to that inserted in regarding the right to review and comment on changes to the GTC Dissolution of MEH Peoples agreed that a portion of our proposed f up to the word terminated on line should be restored Peoples only concern in proposing deletion was that the LLC Agreement might be requested by the ICC Staff due to the reference As revised the reference is removed Confidentiality Peoples agreed to rethink the provisions of re confidentiality of the compensation provions of Articles and This was not confidential in the NIGAS approval proceeding Because the ICC Staff will be aware of the provisions I do not know why Peoples proposes to require the procedures needed to maintain confidentiality of these provisions in the approval proceeding Section Peoples agreed to mutual review and agreement re forwardlooking statements re the Hub Section At the meeting Peoples agreed that the third sentence is confusing and should be revised I would suggest Peoples will inform MEH promptly after it learns of information indicating that a revision to information regarding Hub Capacity should be made or proposed in accordance with this Section Tomorrow I will rereview my notes to make sure that I have covered the regulatory areas I have notes on other sections also if you have any need for them Ill give you a call tomorrow after I return from a morning hearing around am

equal scheduling priority with other firm interstate and intrastate firm transactions Peopels agreed that this item Item can be deleted I believe Peoples wishes to revise to read permitted by the terms of the GTC or required by any Law and Judment Sect Peoples proposes to delete our proposed Section which requires Peoples to use its best efforts to minimize imbalances experienced by Hub Shippers through use of management services offered under pipeline tariffs Such services should be offered soon under Order compliance filings This provision was inserted as part of a paragraph in Peoples initial draft which would have required MEH to compensate Peoples for imbalances experienced on pieplines as a result of Hub Transactions Peoples had taken this provision from the NIGAS Hub agreement In response we had included the wording of to at least require best efforts to minimize imbalances on the pipelines Peoples now proposes to delete all of this on the ground that imbalances on the pipelines are the responsibility of the Hub Shippers and not of Peoples or MEH The GTC has provisions covering the responsibility of shippers to address imbalances on the Hub Facilities and Peoples points to the Parking and Loaning Service for Shippers to address imbalances In reviewin g this I believe Peoples is right Because the language requiring MEH to address imbalnaces on the pieplines has been deleted I think we can delete the language of requiring Peoples to use best efforts to minimize those imbalances Sect Responsibility for regulatory compliance Peoples proposed changes to the language we inserted in in the second sentence from the end which indicated that Peoples is responsible for compliance with the GTC Peoples proposed that each party be responsible At the meeting we explained that this language was included to recognize FERC precedent requiring that in circumstances such as this the agreement must identify the party responsible for regulatory complaince and that party must be the certificate holder Peoples agreed at the meeting that our original language for this sentence should be restored The Agreement presently provides that Peoples in its sole discretion may propose changes in the GTC David indicated at the meeting that at a minimum MEH should be advised of changes in advance and provided with an opportunity for comments before such changes are proposed Peoples agreed to include such a provision Also Peoples agreed that Section should include a representation that Peoples has provided MEH with a current copy of the presently effective GTC Section GTC Peoples agreed at the meeting that the definition of GTC should be changed to end after the words from time to time This eliminates the refernce to modification in Peoples sole discretion Section and Peoples agreed that the definitions should refer only to MEH and Peoples and not to controlled persons Section Peoples agreed that the definition of Hub Capacity could be changed to eliminate the reference to determination by Peoples in its sole discretion The determination should be in accordance with the GTC Peoples suggested that a standard of good faith or commercially reasonable would be acceptable Section Peoples agreed at the meeting that Section could be revised to eliminate the refernce to Laws and Judgments with a materially adverse effect Peoples agrees that there should be a representation that the Agreement does n ot violate any Judgment or Law applicable to itas originally proposed Section The discussion at the meeting indicated that Peoples may accept use of a standard of commercially reasonable with regard to its judgment under i and MEHs obligation to perform in accordance with the Operating Statement Laws and Judgments in ii I was surprised that Peoples suggested this re As I understand it the concern is that MEH should not be liable for contract damages in the event that it acts in a commercially reasonable manner but cannot for some reason comply with the GTC or a Law or Judgment I wonder if we can accomplish this result with language in a later section of the Agreement regarding liability My concern is that a provision indicating that MEHs responsibility for compliance with regualtory requirements Laws and Judgments is limited to best efforts or items it knows about may raise a red flag for the regulators I would like to discuss whether there is another way to deal with potential liability without changing ii to refer to best or commercially reasonable efforts Lets discuss tomorrow Section Filing for Governmental Approval At the meeting Peoples indicated that although it believes it should have sole control over regulatory filings Peoples will agree to include a provision indicating thatPrior to the filing of applications pleadings or testimony related to approval for operation of the Hub Peoples will provide copies of such materials to MEH and consider comments provided by MEH We should discuss with the business peoples whether this is sufficient and how specific this provision should be The language here would be comparable to that inserted in regarding the right to review and comment on changes to the GTC Dissolution of MEH Peoples agreed that a portion of our proposed f up to the word terminated on line should be restored Peoples only concern in proposing deletion was that the LLC Agreement might be requested by the ICC Staff due to the reference As revised the reference is removed Confidentiality Peoples agreed to rethink the provisions of re confidentiality of the compensation provions of Articles and This was not confidential in the NIGAS approval proceeding Because the ICC Staff will be aware of the provisions I do not know why Peoples proposes to require the procedures needed to maintain confidentiality of these provisions in the approval proceeding Section Peoples agreed to mutual review and agreement re forwardlooking statements re the Hub Section At the meeting Peoples agreed that the third sentence is confusing and should be revised I would suggest Peoples will inform MEH promptly after it learns of information indicating that a revision to information regarding Hub Capacity should be made or proposed in accordance with this Section Tomorrow I will rereview my notes to make sure that I have covered the regulatory areas I have notes on other sections also if you have any need for them Ill give you a call tomorrow after I return from a morning hearing around am
