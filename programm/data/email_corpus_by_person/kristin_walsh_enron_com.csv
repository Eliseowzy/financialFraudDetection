Improvements Future Fish Credits Limited Washington House Extends Aluminum Smelters Power ReSale Rights by MWs BC Elections According to our information the BC government is preparing for the Liberal take this week The election is slated for May and it appears likely that we are looking at a near Liberal sweep they are currently leading to at the polls There is about a threeweek lead time between the general election on May th the Final Count on May th and the Return Day on June th so there will be a period of jockeying around some issues The New Democratic Party NDP leader Ujjal Dosanjh has effectively conceded the election in a public announcement Dosanjh is making public pleas to voters not to desert the NDP in favor of the Greens so that the NDP can retain official party status seats Dosanjh has stated that he will be happy if the NDP gets to seats The following are likely to be the key energy policy officials once the Liberal Party takes power in BC Richard Neufeld Minister of Energy Mines and Northern Development replacing NDP Minister Glenn Robertson Dan Jarvis Deputy critic on Energy Mines and Northern Development Murray Coell Minister of Environment Lands and Parks replacing Ian Waddell John Van Dongen Fisheries Neufeld Jarvis Coell and Van Dongen are currently Members of the Legislative Assembly MLAs While Gordon Campbell the probable incoming premier will have been effectively muzzled in the interim when it comes to talk about energy deregulation the opposition will likely have plenty to say about it The people well need to be looking at this regard are Glenn Robertson Minister of Energy and Mines and Ian Waddell Minister of Environment Land Parks It appears certain that the Liberals will move to privatize at least some of the power crown corporations almost immediately They have promised a balanced budget and a chunk of money to do it their way they have made campaign promises about privatization to stir the economy and they have tight back channels with the crown corporations management who want a straight privatization plan instead of coop approach to deregulation Sources report that if elected the Liberals promise a referendum on land claims treaties with the local native Indians or First Nations These treaties result from overlapping claims to land and serve to block land development forestry mining etc While the NDP has been supportive of the First Nations land claims process while in office the promised Liberal referendum would seem to suggest that the Liberals intend to backtrack and not recognize the First Nations rights In other words there would be an increased impetus for mining and forestry This development is surprising since the Liberals have traditionally enjoyed strong Indian support and the land claims process was originally started under a Liberal government If the Liberals press forward with a referendum on the process there is the potential for violent flareups between the First Nations and the government These flareups have occurred in the past though not recently BPA BPA is urging the White House to increase its authority to borrow from the federal Treasury by billion to build over new projects for kilovolt transmission lines and substations online between and BPA officials hope the new borrowing authority will be included in a comprehensive energy strategy the Bush administration is expected to release next week although federal officials have yet to give the final word on the BPA request Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham key members of Congress and the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney who has taken charge of developing the administrations energy strategy all have been briefed on BPAs proposal BPA has been building a case for a budget item that officials say would be a significant boost to the regions power infrastructure in the near term If the administration doesnt include it in its energy strategy BPA officials say they will nevertheless press for the increased borrowing authority in Congress BPA plans for the first time to use more fish credits than cash to meet its annual debt obligation reducing its cash outlay by some million BPA had expected its borrowing authority to be sufficient until but given the energy situation BPA could hit the ceiling by BPA will be spilling water over its dams as a part of the salmon protection plan To make up for the shortfall the agency will have to repurchase approximately billion on the electricity spot market these costs will be passed on to energy consumers as a part of the subscription rate hike in October Oregon Governor Kitzhaber is pushing for more spills Steve Wright other BPA officials are considering the effects of keeping water in the reservoirs as a safety net should there be a cold spell next winter which has precipitated a federal lawsuit from environmental organizations against the National Marine Fisheries Service Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund is leading this charge a coalition which includes Trout Unlimited and the Sierra Club The official line is they want to disallow the Federal Caucus and BPA from declaring a fish emergency which would allow them to determine the amount of water spilled over the dams among other things However by exercising a fish emergency BPA becomes qualified for additional federal credits which is probably the real source of contention here Aluminum Smelters The bill passed by the House Energy Committee yesterday does extend the resale rights of the smelters to megawatts of power beyond the October termination date BPA is negotiating even though they have no legal obligation to serve the smelters New attack ads paid for by the aluminum companies are running to build political pressure to continue to receive and resell megawatts of power beyond October in addition to receiving other payments for staying offline

currently holding polls at a probusiness rightofcenter par ty led by Gordon Campbell Major changes in British Columbia energy policy are likely under a Libera l government A low snow pack a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission an d public concern about outstanding debts owed by US power consumers could for ce BC Hydro to stop outofprovince power sales once existing contracts expire BC Hydros additional generation at Williston is likely undeliverable Liberal Party Platform Income tax cut that would make BCs income tax the lowest in Canada Independent audit of the provinces books amid allegations of NDP mismanagement and incompetence Review of all Crown corporations including BC Hydro to enhance efficien cy and management quality Campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the Corporate Capital Tax the Machinery Equipment Tax and the Corporate Income Tax Energy Agenda According to sources under the Liberal partys rule significant changes i n the BC governments energy policy could include a move toward the privatization of some BC Hydro assets perhaps including its transmission assets as well as increased government support for independent power producers and coalfired production At the same time a rate review and attempts to establish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack of clarity about the provinces overall energy strategy o ver the next few years Campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding coalfired production Campbell calls thermal coal an as set that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in BC A highranking NDP source believes that Campbell will take the pro vince back along the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting n ew technology The source expects this to lead to strong protests from environmentalists These are confrontational moves and people will be on the streets Campbells most likely choice for energy minister is Richard Neufeldt thou gh we caution that this decision depends on the makeup of the legislature aft er the election Neufeldt is responsible for the Liberal Partys energy m ining and northern development portfolio Sources speculate that if rightwing Liberals are dissatisfied with the partys performance after the May election Neufeldt could again defect to the Opposition However this giv es Campbell even greater incentive to name Neufeldt energy minister a highprofile position Should the Liberals win the election Gordon Campbell has indicated that he would return BC Hydro to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission The BC government has derived billion in revenue from BC Hydro since roughly percent of its profit Critics say this has undermined the utilitys ability to pay down approximately billion in debt and inv est in the future This also has left Hydro without a rate stabilization fund something that sources feel may be needed this year Campbell reportedly intends to address these issues and one can expect this to lead to calls f or change Electricity Export Policy Currently the BC Utilities Commission is demanding more information about B C Hydros outofprovince sales The Commission has warned that given th e low snow pack the utility could be a net importer of power this year Supporti ng this view the Northwest Power Planning Council representing BC Hydros key trading partners in the US has said that it would not be able to rely upon British Columbia or Alberta during peak consumption periods over the next f ew years and that its customers face a percent chance of not making it through the winter without power losses The combination of a low snow pac k a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed to BC Hydro by US consumers may force BC Hydro to stop outofprovince power sales once existing contracts expire BC Hydro Privatization A key campaign energy issue for the Liberal party is the privatization of B C Hydro Campbell has urged greater electricity competition saying We need to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all producers an d consumers on an equal and nondiscriminatory basis He stated that independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn I want to change that big time he told the Canadian Institute of Energy Campbe ll also urged more natural gas development including pipelines and cogeneration plants Campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by NDP leader Ujjal Dosanjh Campbell stated on April We have no intentio n of selling BC Hydro we have no intentions of selling their transmission lines no intention of selling their dams we have no intention of selling their reservoirs Liberal Party spokesman Mike Morton also reiterated on April that BC Hydro would not be for sale A highlevel NDP source commented tha t Campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regarding BC Hydro essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams transmissio n lines or generating stations but that he is in favor of opening the sector up to competition However local sources believe that some parts of BC Hydro might be sold as part of an overall review of BC Crown Corporations to enhance efficiency Likely sale prospects include BC Hydros distribution channels and its e nergy trading subsidiary Powerex In addition Gary FarrellCollins the Libera l finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister after Neufeldt has stated that public ownership of BC Hydros noncore businesses such as Westech its systems division and customer billing could come under review BC Hydro Williston Generation Current reservoirs levels at BC Hydros Williston hydrogeneration facil ity are at ft which allows BC Hydro to drop levels another ft Gwhsft under their current permit The one drawback to this plans additional generation involves the Mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease operation if water levels were to fall below ft Sources close to the Minister of Mines Energy elect Richard Neufeldt indicate that levels at Williston probably will not be drawn down below Mackenzies operational limits due to concern over political backlash

Improvements Future Fish Credits Limited Washington House Extends Aluminum Smelters Power ReSale Rights by MWs BC Elections According to our information the BC government is preparing for the Liberal take this week The election is slated for May and it appears likely that we are looking at a near Liberal sweep they are currently leading to at the polls There is about a threeweek lead time between the general election on May th the Final Count on May th and the Return Day on June th so there will be a period of jockeying around some issues The New Democratic Party NDP leader Ujjal Dosanjh has effectively conceded the election in a public announcement Dosanjh is making public pleas to voters not to desert the NDP in favor of the Greens so that the NDP can retain official party status seats Dosanjh has stated that he will be happy if the NDP gets to seats The following are likely to be the key energy policy officials once the Liberal Party takes power in BC Richard Neufeld Minister of Energy Mines and Northern Development replacing NDP Minister Glenn Robertson Dan Jarvis Deputy critic on Energy Mines and Northern Development Murray Coell Minister of Environment Lands and Parks replacing Ian Waddell John Van Dongen Fisheries Neufeld Jarvis Coell and Van Dongen are currently Members of the Legislative Assembly MLAs While Gordon Campbell the probable incoming premier will have been effectively muzzled in the interim when it comes to talk about energy deregulation the opposition will likely have plenty to say about it The people well need to be looking at this regard are Glenn Robertson Minister of Energy and Mines and Ian Waddell Minister of Environment Land Parks It appears certain that the Liberals will move to privatize at least some of the power crown corporations almost immediately They have promised a balanced budget and a chunk of money to do it their way they have made campaign promises about privatization to stir the economy and they have tight back channels with the crown corporations management who want a straight privatization plan instead of coop approach to deregulation Sources report that if elected the Liberals promise a referendum on land claims treaties with the local native Indians or First Nations These treaties result from overlapping claims to land and serve to block land development forestry mining etc While the NDP has been supportive of the First Nations land claims process while in office the promised Liberal referendum would seem to suggest that the Liberals intend to backtrack and not recognize the First Nations rights In other words there would be an increased impetus for mining and forestry This development is surprising since the Liberals have traditionally enjoyed strong Indian support and the land claims process was originally started under a Liberal government If the Liberals press forward with a referendum on the process there is the potential for violent flareups between the First Nations and the government These flareups have occurred in the past though not recently BPA BPA is urging the White House to increase its authority to borrow from the federal Treasury by billion to build over new projects for kilovolt transmission lines and substations online between and BPA officials hope the new borrowing authority will be included in a comprehensive energy strategy the Bush

currently holding polls at a probusiness rightofcenter par ty led by Gordon Campbell Major changes in British Columbia energy policy are likely under a Libera l government A low snow pack a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission an d public concern about outstanding debts owed by US power consumers could for ce BC Hydro to stop outofprovince power sales once existing contracts expire BC Hydros additional generation at Williston is likely undeliverable Liberal Party Platform Income tax cut that would make BCs income tax the lowest in Canada Independent audit of the provinces books amid allegations of NDP mismanagement and incompetence Review of all Crown corporations including BC Hydro to enhance efficien cy and management quality Campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the Corporate Capital Tax the Machinery Equipment Tax and the Corporate Income Tax Energy Agenda According to sources under the Liberal partys rule significant changes i n the BC governments energy policy could include a move toward the privatization of some BC Hydro assets perhaps including its transmission assets as well as increased government support for independent power producers and coalfired production At the same time a rate review and attempts to establish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack of clarity about the provinces overall energy strategy o ver the next few years Campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding coalfired production Campbell calls thermal coal an as set that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in BC A highranking NDP source believes that Campbell will take the pro vince back along the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting n ew technology The source expects this to lead to strong protests from environmentalists These are confrontational moves and people will be on the streets Campbells most likely choice for energy minister is Richard Neufeldt thou gh we caution that this decision depends on the makeup of the legislature aft er the election Neufeldt is responsible for the Liberal Partys energy m ining and northern development portfolio Sources speculate that if rightwing Liberals are dissatisfied with the partys performance after the May election Neufeldt could again defect to the Opposition However this giv es Campbell even greater incentive to name Neufeldt energy minister a highprofile position Should the Liberals win the election Gordon Campbell has indicated that he would return BC Hydro to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission The BC government has derived billion in revenue from BC Hydro since roughly percent of its profit Critics say this has undermined the utilitys ability to pay down approximately billion in debt and inv est in the future This also has left Hydro without a rate stabilization fund something that sources feel may be needed this year Campbell reportedly intends to address these issues and one can expect this to lead to calls f or change Electricity Export Policy Currently the BC Utilities Commission is demanding more information about B C Hydros outofprovince sales The Commission has warned that given th e low snow pack the utility could be a net importer of power this year Supporti ng this view the Northwest Power Planning Council representing BC Hydros key trading partners in the US has said that it would not be able to rely upon British Columbia or Alberta during peak consumption periods over the next f ew years and that its customers face a percent chance of not making it through the winter without power losses The combination of a low snow pac k a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed to BC Hydro by US consumers may force BC Hydro to stop outofprovince power sales once existing contracts expire BC Hydro Privatization A key campaign energy issue for the Liberal party is the privatization of B C Hydro Campbell has urged greater electricity competition saying We need to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all producers an d consumers on an equal and nondiscriminatory basis He stated that independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn I want to change that big time he told the Canadian Institute of Energy Campbe ll also urged more natural gas development including pipelines and cogeneration plants Campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by NDP leader Ujjal Dosanjh Campbell stated on April We have no intentio n of selling BC Hydro we have no intentions of selling their transmission lines no intention of selling their dams we have no intention of selling their reservoirs Liberal Party spokesman Mike Morton also reiterated on April that BC Hydro would not be for sale A highlevel NDP source commented tha t Campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regarding BC Hydro essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams transmissio n lines or generating stations but that he is in favor of opening the sector up to competition However local sources believe that some parts of BC Hydro might be sold as part of an overall review of BC Crown Corporations to enhance efficiency Likely sale prospects include BC Hydros distribution channels and its e nergy trading subsidiary Powerex In addition Gary FarrellCollins the Libera l finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister after Neufeldt has stated that public ownership of BC Hydros noncore businesses such as Westech its systems division and customer billing could come under review BC Hydro Williston Generation Current reservoirs levels at BC Hydros Williston hydrogeneration facil ity are at ft which allows BC Hydro to drop levels another ft Gwhsft under their current permit The one drawback to this plans additional generation involves the Mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease operation if water levels were to fall below ft Sources close to the Minister of Mines Energy elect Richard Neufeldt indicate that levels at Williston probably will not be drawn down below Mackenzies operational limits due to concern over political backlash

due to a one day optout clause in all longterm power contracts PGE and State locked in tough negotiations several issues on the table PUCimposed requirement forcing PGE to ultimately be responsible for California energy supplies Price of the grid state times book value vs PGE times book value PGE will not use any of the B secured last week to help their ailing utility Daviss announcement of long term power contract didnt include some details Of the megawatts secured this far only are available this summer Some of the long term contracts are really only for three months None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot market One the same day Davis announced long term contracts Davis also quietly announce a rate hike FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal PGE Transmissions deal One thing that is still uncertain is PGE Bankruptcy may still be a likely alternative if current negotiations to buy PGEs share of the electric transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April when all longterm power contracts being negotiated have a oneday optout clause they can exercise unilaterally if a comprehensive solution has not been reached by the state and its major utilities According to sources close to senior PGE officials PGE made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal on the transmission lines depends on the California governments willingness to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make until now PGE will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to relieve it of the PUCimposed requirement to be the electricity buyer of last resort Current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all times to supply Californias energy needs As long as the state steps in and makes those purchases as it has for the past three months the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings But PGE officials are worried this summers supply and Daviss concern over how fast he is draining the states budget surplus If things get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity it buys through longterm contracts then PGE will be left holding the bag Thus as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid PGE is demanding a comprehensive solution that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed to pay State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of get out of jail free card so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough negotiations that are complicated by three other factors PGEs public behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy State legislative demands that the price Davis negotiate for PGEs part of the electricity grid be no more than times revenues from the grid and the FERC must positively approve any grid purchase by the state of California The principal concern on the price front is that PGE wants to sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their transmission while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the politically acceptable limit We see times book value as an absolute upper bound There is no way PGE will get more than that whatever they think according to the leader of one main consumer groups We are going to try to force any deals down to about in any case Negotiators for Davis are also trying to propositionproof any transmission deal to protect against a later ballot proposal They think there are ways to do that but not if the price of PGEs part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative Remember if Daviss eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative he will be running for reelection on the same ballot as a public initiative designed to overturn his solution On the Sacramento front no one understands PGEs motives The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game PGE is playing In a three day period PGE made a series of announcements that left everyone scratching their heads Late Thursday PGE officials leaked information to California papers that they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity transmission grid to the state which seemed like obvious good news but then made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least above what the state was currently offering While a deal can still be done anything like the billion PGE wants would be very hard to get through the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase Late Friday PGE officials announced that they had secured a billion loan for the parent company not the electricity utility and would use the money to pay off bondholders other creditors and to return million to shareholders in a new dividend payout Not a cent of that money was earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PGE and that left at least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood Over the weekend PGE leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay off its energy suppliers debt for cents on the dollar right now For generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will make them whole in a couple of months that kind of trial balloon is extremely unnerving Thus in a very short time period PGEs corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at least a part of the billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and PGEs fundraising will harden and deepen those demands As one senior political official told our source just when you think the corporate leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible they come up with something even more outrageous PGEs actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to construct to solve Californias problems State Democrats doubt they will get Republican support for a deal which means a vote will fall short of the twothirds majority necessary for immediate enactment resulting in days for the legislation to go into effect Additionally in the past hours many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the electricity grid Longterm Contracts Davis didnt tell the whole truth Yesterday Davis announced that he had signed longterm power deals for megawatts of power out of a total megawatts he wanted to sign eventually According to the press release Davis is now of the way toward his longterm goal and has already solved the hardest part of Californias energy crisis This means consumers would maybe pay more than necessary five years from now but these contracts guaranteed that consumers would pay less for the next three years What Davis failed to highlight was that of the megawatt commitment actually only megawatts are available this summer when demand is expected to megawatts and some of these longterm contracts are actually only good for three months None of these contracts however keep California from having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year While the media was concern with Daviss announcement of long term contracts for California of less concern to the media was Daviss quietly announced a decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers The state will accept the emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a permanent increase as well as an additional increase for consumers that will take effect early when the old rate cut legislation expires That would bring the average charge to about cents a kilowatt hour FERC The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve it in a positive vote Senior California officials and legislators doubt that FERC has jurisdiction and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal But they may be wrong The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs off on the deal Its power over transmission deal is absolute no matter what anyone says according to source close to the President There are three possibilities FERC could pocket veto it by not even putting it on agenda for discussion the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted down The Democrat on the commission William Massey has already said he is opposed to it or the Commission could approve it but with condition that Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system One complicating factor in the FERC decision however is that its chairman Curt Hebert who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale may not be around long enough to have his say Hebert is definitely not a shoo in for the FERC

Executive Summary An announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of longterm contracts price and term The threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as Davis hatches a plan to pass on court ordered rate increases and issue revenue bonds Audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred to parent companies Davis is expected to use the threat of endless appeals in courts and a possible ballot initiative in November to keep the pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt as well as to limit the scope of the rate hikes Davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to California consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy Davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups If there is a ballot initiative in November to challenge the expected courtordered rate hikes it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state Legislation and Bail Out Bill ABX was heard for several hours in the Senate Appropriations yesterday Issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure specifically for communities that have harsh climates However the bill has received support from almost everyone including consumer groups The bill is expected to pass sometime today Tim Gage CA Director of Finance said Davis supports all the provisions in ABX and expected to sign Bill ABX was not heard in the Assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear today In committee hearings Monday the DWR testified it is spent all of the M and were spending Mday in the spot market to buy power According to sources with direct access to Governor Davis the ongoing court battle as discussed below is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a settlement Davis recognizes that the expected court ruling in the CPUC case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to California rate payers despite that ruling the state government has the ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the two utilities unless they come to terms Thus Davis believes that California consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity charges but he plans to use the threat of an appeal and a possible ballot initiative to limit the amount of the rate hikes A plan to exempt the lowest income smallest consumers from any rate increase and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using of a baseline usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in Sacramento That would still hit about one half of all consumers since the baseline is set at of average consumption but it is progressive in a politically important sense Making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night when PGE admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates The companys defense they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash was met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious efforts by Californians to use less electricity Every time you think theres a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves something like this happens one legislator moaned LongTerm Contracts A second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of longterm power buying contracts Davis initiated earlier this month The first wave of those contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be surprisingly positive according to officials in the talks We got a series of good offers in those initial proposals And some not so good ones one official told our source The idea is to announce the results of the first contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say you want in on this with these terms We think well eventually shake loose a lot of supply with this strategy Bankruptcy Because of these new dynamics there is improved market confidence that California will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for SoCal Edison and PGE even as they are set to miss another round of payments to creditors and suppliers today remember there is a standstill agreement among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until Feb We believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost by the court case in front of US District Judge Ronald SW Lew in Los Angeles which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week at the latest In fact without that political cover it would be impossible to square all the various circles of this crisis Audit Results and Ballot Initiatives Markets Bush administration officials and perhaps utility companies themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of l to bring all electricity generation back under state control The threat of a proposition initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission released in the last hours confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since midJanuary First the audit of SoCal Edison confirmed that billion of the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells power Second it confirmed that Edison electric paid nearly billion in profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even while it was going on a debtissuing binge The audit of PGE released late last night was even more damaging PGE management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis by not making deep spending cuts including scaling back management salaries The auditors also questioned the utilitys decision to funnel some billion of its profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks Basically they took the money and ran as State Senate Speaker Burton put it yesterday What appears to be Governor Gray Davis grudging acceptance of reality is actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough rate hikestaxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without triggering a new and far more damaging burst of populist outrage among a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making this all up There is no doubt that this use of money by SoCal Edison and the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the spirit of the deregulation law but that is irrelevant in popular political terms Were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by the court case discussed below these audits would make settlement extremely difficult Keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key to understanding the very complex game that Davis his advisers and senior legislators are now playing A ballot initiative would be a potential disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at reestablishing full public control over the electric utilities Even if the state and utilities successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during that prolonged period Thats something California cannot afford as businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate Court Battle Thus legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of the court case in Los Angeles that SoCal Edison and PGE are likely to win in midFebruary The court will most likely grant the two utilities billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders of consumers who would see bills rise by at least California politicians could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start of this extended drama political cover Davis will then have to rely on his political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the utilities to pass on something less than the full billion debt PGE and SoCal Edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they have accumulated since August last year when the PUC refused to let them raise prices even as electricity prices soared The court said the deregulation law was crystal clear when the two utilities had repaid socalled stranded costs they were free to begin charging whatever they needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power Although the utilities won this case the Judge stayed his order until February th at the state governments request As that deadline approaches an intense new negotiating round is under way On the one hand political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher electric prices the courts made me do it but on the other hand they also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would force electricity rates up by about on top of natural gas bills that have soared by about since last year Utility companies are playing this card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final bailout Well just wait until the court puts the order into effect in midFebruary then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and easily One tactic the state political officials are using in order to force a settlement is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the next couple of years One political official pointed out that they could keep the utilities from receiving their money this year next year or perhaps even the year after Sure we tell them they will probably win in court and get that money Eventually We are making them well aware that unless we have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the Supreme Court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least We dont think the creditors will be quite that patient
<3821444.1075856229286.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kristin.walsh@enron.com,2001-01-22 04:38:00,California Update Cc Summary Discussions continue today over bill ABX focus will be on price and term New legislation introduced today whereby the state will try to save the utilities from bankruptcy by taking ownership of utilities hydro assets in exchange for rate increases Wednesday state receives bids from auction rate ranges are expected to be between and cents per kilowatt hour Mid week audit findings will be released audit expected to show PGEs utility subsidiary handed over B to the holding company The holding company used B to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock State commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible bankruptcy scenario Bankruptcy still very possible for both companies Davis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue solutions or bail out Legislation There will be continued discussion regarding bill ABX in the Senate today The discussion will focus on the rate cap of cents per kilowatt hour as well as the term Assemblyman Keeley the author indicated that he believed cents was a fantasy and impossible to obtain Today Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek will introduce legislation whereby the state would temporary or permanently take both PGE and Edisions hydroelectric facilities or transmission lines or both in exchange for keeping the utilities out of bankruptcy The state would allow PGE and Edison to impose rate increases however the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this month by the CPUC as an emergency surcharge The money collected from consumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state would then enter into longterm contracts with power generators Under the bill the state of California would control of all Californias electricity As you can imagine this legislation has not received unanimous praise According to recent corporate filings PGEs hydroelectric plants alone would be valued between and billion This amount just happens to be what Davis estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee once the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the billion in debt Davis is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help with about billion in debt while the utilities of course say the full billion should be covered On Wednesday state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come Davis insists there are already several bids for his cents per kilowatt hour ceiling though few agree with his opinion A handful of smaller independent electricity providers with about a share of California power market indicated Sunday night they would come down to less than eight cents or less than half of what they currently charge in return for the stability of long term contracts Because consumers pay about cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current PUC rules any hope California has to work off the back debts for these utilities lies in hitting something very close to Davis price cap without falling back on higher prices for consumers The level of bids will be particularly important since bond rating agencies moved to put the state of California on a Credit watch on Friday worried that there was no obvious longterm repayment plan for the billions of dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state Utilitys Audit By the middle of this week California auditors will release their findings about how much money PGE and SoCal Edison actually owe to institutions outside their own holding company structure This will define the limits of what the state will guarantee if they guarantee any of the debt The truly explosive part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years A source with knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last three years PGEs utility subsidiary handed over about billion to the holding company Of that total the holding company used billion to pay shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock Another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current power crisis when regulators at the time of deregulation under the direction of Former RGov Pete Wilson forced the two utilities to sell at least half of their powergenerating plants Auditors are expected to say that if the utilities still owned all these plants electricity would cost only cents a kilowatt hour compared with over cents an hour on average in December and January Bankruptcy The threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities Senior advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility companies that ended in bankruptcy As all the parties involved hunker down for another intensely political week they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy but to push this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an advantage Under such conditions the risks of one or more of the players fumbling and triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy is still quite high Californias political leaders order a series of independent analyses to determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy the state or the two utilities The short answer was that no one has any idea Below are the findings of the report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge Would the companies be eligible for Chapter style temporary bankruptcy Some of the advisors thought that PGE and Edisons finances were so bad that Chapter style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option Advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the companies into full liquidation This would most certainly be guaranteed chaos Could the bankruptcy court actually force the PUC to raise the price of electricity to consumers The legal basis for passing on rate increases to consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought particularly if there is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies And there is still the question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge If the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets seriously and finds that PGE and Edison cannot afford to buy electricity he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages If the utilities go into bankruptcy the first creditors in line would be the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges The state could become almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier one of the reasons why suppliers wont sell electricity on credit to these companies now If the two companies went bankrupt it would be the largest bankruptcies in history straining just about everyone involved in the process The corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets from the utility by the FERC for PGE and already in place for Edison may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies currently think This is particularly true if this weeks audit shows the two corporations transferring billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder dividend payments Davis Opinion polls show that Governor Gray Davis is getting high marks for his job and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits One of Davis concerns is according to a senior official in the Governors office that a deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so antiutility and antibusiness that it cripples future growth in the state According to a senior official No one thought Howard Jarvis and his property tax initiative would succeed in destroying our education system but he did with one just ballot line and a lot of popular revulsion The threat of direct popular action is at least as large now as then Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield is already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that individual electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay their debt through higher ratepayer bills This official goes on to say The anger at utility companies is so high here that almost anything Rosenfield could think of would pass and we couldnt do anything about it This threat has begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always appeared wide open to political leaders floating a bond issue or a guarantee for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next several years

shortterm power purchases with no price cap through Febnd New legislation ABX and SBX would seek longterm contracts with cent cap and creation of California Power and Conservation Financing Authority The longterm contracts proposed in ABX are likely to be subject to significant amendment and renegotiation prior to the Febnd expiration of SBX The authority proposed in SBX would have bond issuance powers to finance new generation capacity and conservation measures Negotiations under way on using bond authority for a utility bailoututilities and state government split over debt obligations of utility parents State borrowing plans and power purchases create credit risks for state treasury SoCal Edison misses more payments Bush Administration opposes price caps but is supporting state efforts to split PGE into separate gas and electricity companies in order to assure continued gas supply Absent urgent passage of a bailout plan or an agreement on longerterm contracts utility bankruptcy is still the most likely scenario For further information contact Robert Johnston x or Kristin Walsh x Legislation Passes ShortTerm Measures SBX passed the California State Senate easily As we said yesterday the bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the Department of Water and Resources until February nd The Department will have million available to finance power purchases but there expectations that these costs could easily rise to billion by next week ABX has evolved into a longerterm solution and in its current form would authorize the Department of Water and Resources to enter into longterm contracts as opposed to the day contracts in SBX to buy power at a price cap of cents per kwh This legislation is not expected to pass today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week period covered by SBX when negotiations between generators the utilities and the state are likely to resume SBX What Will the State Do With the Bond Authority A second piece of legislation currently under consideration SB Xhas created uncertainty in the markets This legislation will create a California Power and Conservation Financing Authority with bond issuance authority The uncertainty concerns whether the new authority will address the problem of the billion in outstanding debt owed by the utilities The current text of the legislation focuses only on longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving efficiency Yet the legislation also says the authority may issue bonds exercise power of eminent domain and enter into joint power agreements and buy own and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a project The general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of either issuing bonds to finance past debts or using eminent domain or the bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a Ch proceeding While neither Davis nor Senate leader Burton are talking about a full billion bailout at this point the idea of using bond money to pay past debts continues to circulate in the legislature One of the reasons none of the utility creditors have moved to demand repayment is that they are being quietly reassured by the Governors office that there will be a governmentsupported debt workout in the near future Bailout Could Depend on Parents of Utilities Absorbing Losses The big problem and one which have kept the Governor nor the utility companies from opting for this solution is a massive battle over how much of the outstanding billion in back debt the holding companies of the two utilities will absorb in any restructuring deal As we have reported something like half of that debt is owed by the utilities to their own sister powergenerating companies within their holding company structure the partial deregulation allowed the utilities to split into powergenerating and powerdistributing companies so one side of the holding company buys power from the other side and public opinion polls show overwhelming majorities understand this quite well Davis wants the utility companies to acknowledge the nature of this debt and to absorb some substantial part of the internal debt within their corporate structures we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or issue bonds to deal with the rest As one very senior California political leader explained getting the utility holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread public outrage about a bailout of private pricegouging companies with taxpayer money Since of Californians currently blame the utilities and the PUC for this crisis and only blame Davis this is a crucial political stance for the Governor But of course absorbing anything like billion in debt would be quite a shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and powergenerating branches of the two utilities and they began spreading the word that they were quite willing to accept bankruptcy Thus by midweek both sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court that would be a worst case solution for all sides The countrys economy would suffer from the resulting credit shock the Governors political future would suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a bankruptcy judge while most private sector legal authorities believe the utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during bankruptcy procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of the debt in the end In addition they would most likely face a state government determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in a major way Senator Burtons SBX legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically to make this point quite explicit It would set up a California Power and Conservation Financing Authority with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent domain It would finance new power plants and consider the feasibility and public interest of the state acquiring operating and maintaining transmission facilities currently owned by investorowned and municipal utilities As we write this all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the bankruptcy ledge to safe ground and there is no question the tone has shifted in the last hours from macho confrontation to maybe weve run this thing out as far as we can But as we have noted the chance for miscalculation is still quite high There is no solution agreed to at this time the standoff over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities holding company is continuing and the technical fact of default still makes it possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate accelerated payment Default Update Thursday SoCal Edison million default to California Power Exchange After Edison failed to make a M electricity payment yesterday the California Power Authority began seizing longterm contacts and reselling them to recoup some of the money owed to generators PGE said it expects its trading privileges at the Cal Power Authority to be suspended today leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources While the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted PGEs and SoCals ability to buy power the Department of Water and Resources will be able to pick up some of the slack at least in the very shortterm The state itself may be getting into risky credit territory The proposed California Public Power Authority would borrow in the neighborhood of billion from the state General Fund in advance of this years expected fiscal surplus with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future revenues With nearbankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes it is unclear where the revenues would come from The amount borrowed and terms of repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating agencies Bush Policies As we reported on Wednesday the Bush Administration continues to demonstrate little interest in getting involved in the California crisis PresidentElect Bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root of the current supply shortage Bush and his top officials appear to be unanimously opposed to longterm price caps However there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration according to a source close to a top Bush economic advisor There is significant concern that PGEs credit problems could cause gas suppliers to stop shipments of gas through PGEs pipeline The risk would be that the pipeline could go dry causing significant and possibly dangerous disruptions in California residences and businesses To prevent this problem Bush is working with Davis on a proposal to split PGE into separate gas and electric companies The gas company would be solvent but the electric company would go immediately into Ch following significant defaults

Executive Summary FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives Politically Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis from an economic perspective he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan most notably its exclusion of outofstate generators June st kill clause for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected billion power bill this summereconomic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement QF bid for advance payments from PGE likely to fail in bankruptcy court New generation delays probable because of StateQF squabbling Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal FERC Fallout The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action but is not Rather it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame Once they are politically inoculated the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions Moreover the Administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan Something Less than Effective Price Caps From Daviss point of view the FERC plan has four major flaws The order applies only to California not to the rest of the west NonCalifornia generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California As the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage emergency and does not require any collusion Even when the price caps kick in they are based on the costplus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap The generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control If Davis doesnt sign on to the regional grid by June st then he will have to live with June nd headlines blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California could therefore pay as much as billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of PGE and SCE These sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the FERC andor the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about days One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for longterm power deals The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture The countrys largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PGE Meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the QFs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted If the QFs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the mw of gasfired QF capacity will remain offline Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for longterm contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the MOU for the SCE bailout plan The analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points For example one of the elements of the MOU is a nonbypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid This is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity This makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds According to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company For this and other reasons even if the Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose LongTerm Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to disclose the details of the longterm power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis Even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay

Meet Their May th Deadline Due to Lack of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuancebridge loan by the May th deadline Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart According to sources both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis The Democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund Davis would double dip into the fund Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor However it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place Additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the longterm power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by July If not the state may be in breach of contract Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May th having a bond issuance by July st will be very difficult The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately billion However the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan AB X and AB X AB X authorizes the DWR to sell up to billion in bonds This bill passed the Senate in March but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support AB X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts However sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen currently in AB X Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund For instance Tony Strickland has stated that only of the bonds or approximately billion should be issued Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday Additionally Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount B Lenders JP Morgan B Lehman Brothers B Bear Stearns M Tax Exempt Portion Of the B B is expected to be taxexempt Projected Interest Rate Taxable Rate TaxExempt Rate Current Projected Blended IR Maturity Date August For more details please contact me at Bill SB X Passed the Senate Yesterday but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB X yesterday which authorizes billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority The billion authorized under SB X is not the same as the billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward Again the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations Without the details of the longterm power contracts the governor has negotiated the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power Also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the California Public Power and Conservation Authority However this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August th however some decision will likely be made earlier According to sources the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal though SoCal has signed it The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash The second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB X bridge loan stating that the DWR would received of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would

Executive Summary FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives Politically Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis from an economic perspective he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan most notably its exclusion of outofstate generators June st kill clause for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected billion power bill this summereconomic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement QF bid for advance payments from PGE likely to fail in bankruptcy court New generation delays probable because of StateQF squabbling Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal FERC Fallout The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action but is not Rather it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame Once they are politically inoculated the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions Moreover the Administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan Something Less than Effective Price Caps From Daviss point of view the FERC plan has four major flaws The order applies only to California not to the rest of the west NonCalifornia generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California As the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage emergency and does not require any collusion Even when the price caps kick in they are based on the costplus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap The generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control If Davis doesnt sign on to the regional grid by June st then he will have to live with June nd headlines blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California could therefore pay as much as billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of PGE and SCE These sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the FERC andor the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about days One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for longterm power deals The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture The countrys largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PGE Meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the QFs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted If the QFs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the mw of gasfired QF capacity will remain offline Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for longterm contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the MOU for the SCE bailout plan The analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points For example one of the elements of the MOU is a nonbypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid This is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity This makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds According to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company For this and other reasons even if the Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose LongTerm Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to disclose the details of the longterm power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis Even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay

due to a one day optout clause in all longterm power contracts PGE and State locked in tough negotiations several issues on the table PUCimposed requirement forcing PGE to ultimately be responsible for California energy supplies Price of the grid state times book value vs PGE times book value PGE will not use any of the B secured last week to help their ailing utility Daviss announcement of long term power contract didnt include some details Of the megawatts secured this far only are available this summer Some of the long term contracts are really only for three months None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot market One the same day Davis announced long term contracts Davis also quietly announce a rate hike FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal PGE Transmissions deal One thing that is still uncertain is PGE Bankruptcy may still be a likely alternative if current negotiations to buy PGEs share of the electric transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April when all longterm power contracts being negotiated have a oneday optout clause they can exercise unilaterally if a comprehensive solution has not been reached by the state and its major utilities According to sources close to senior PGE officials PGE made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal on the transmission lines depends on the California governments willingness to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make until now PGE will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to relieve it of the PUCimposed requirement to be the electricity buyer of last resort Current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all times to supply Californias energy needs As long as the state steps in and makes those purchases as it has for the past three months the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings But PGE officials are worried this summers supply and Daviss concern over how fast he is draining the states budget surplus If things get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity it buys through longterm contracts then PGE will be left holding the bag Thus as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid PGE is demanding a comprehensive solution that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed to pay State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of get out of jail free card so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough negotiations that are complicated by three other factors PGEs public behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy State legislative demands that the price Davis negotiate for PGEs part of the electricity grid be no more than times revenues from the grid and the FERC must positively approve any grid purchase by the state of California The principal concern on the price front is that PGE wants to sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their transmission while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the politically acceptable limit We see times book value as an absolute upper bound There is no way PGE will get more than that whatever they think according to the leader of one main consumer groups We are going to try to force any deals down to about in any case Negotiators for Davis are also trying to propositionproof any transmission deal to protect against a later ballot proposal They think there are ways to do that but not if the price of PGEs part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative Remember if Daviss eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative he will be running for reelection on the same ballot as a public initiative designed to overturn his solution On the Sacramento front no one understands PGEs motives The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game PGE is playing In a three day period PGE made a series of announcements that left everyone scratching their heads Late Thursday PGE officials leaked information to California papers that they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity transmission grid to the state which seemed like obvious good news but then made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least above what the state was currently offering While a deal can still be done anything like the billion PGE wants would be very hard to get through the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase Late Friday PGE officials announced that they had secured a billion loan for the parent company not the electricity utility and would use the money to pay off bondholders other creditors and to return million to shareholders in a new dividend payout Not a cent of that money was earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PGE and that left at least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood Over the weekend PGE leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay off its energy suppliers debt for cents on the dollar right now For generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will make them whole in a couple of months that kind of trial balloon is extremely unnerving Thus in a very short time period PGEs corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at least a part of the billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and PGEs fundraising will harden and deepen those demands As one senior political official told our source just when you think the corporate leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible they come up with something even more outrageous PGEs actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to construct to solve Californias problems State Democrats doubt they will get Republican support for a deal which means a vote will fall short of the twothirds majority necessary for immediate enactment resulting in days for the legislation to go into effect Additionally in the past hours many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the electricity grid Longterm Contracts Davis didnt tell the whole truth Yesterday Davis announced that he had signed longterm power deals for megawatts of power out of a total megawatts he wanted to sign eventually According to the press release Davis is now of the way toward his longterm goal and has already solved the hardest part of Californias energy crisis This means consumers would maybe pay more than necessary five years from now but these contracts guaranteed that consumers would pay less for the next three years What Davis failed to highlight was that of the megawatt commitment actually only megawatts are available this summer when demand is expected to megawatts and some of these longterm contracts are actually only good for three months None of these contracts however keep California from having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year While the media was concern with Daviss announcement of long term contracts for California of less concern to the media was Daviss quietly announced a decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers The state will accept the emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a permanent increase as well as an additional increase for consumers that will take effect early when the old rate cut legislation expires That would bring the average charge to about cents a kilowatt hour FERC The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve it in a positive vote Senior California officials and legislators doubt that FERC has jurisdiction and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal But they may be wrong The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs off on the deal Its power over transmission deal is absolute no matter what anyone says according to source close to the President There are three possibilities FERC could pocket veto it by not even putting it on agenda for discussion the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted down The Democrat on the commission William Massey has already said he is opposed to it or the Commission could approve it but with condition that Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system One complicating factor in the FERC decision however is that its chairman Curt Hebert who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale may not be around long enough to have his say Hebert is definitely not a shoo in for the FERC chairman position says one Washington official Two other appointments to the Commission will soon be named this official notes and one of them could easily become chairman

Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the MOU for the SCE bailout plan The analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points For example one of the elements of the MOU is a nonbypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid This is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity This makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds According to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company For this and other reasons even if the Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose LongTerm Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to disclose the details of the longterm power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis Even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay

Executive Summary An announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of longterm contracts price and term The threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as Davis hatches a plan to pass on court ordered rate increases and issue revenue bonds Audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred to parent companies Davis is expected to use the threat of endless appeals in courts and a possible ballot initiative in November to keep the pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt as well as to limit the scope of the rate hikes Davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to California consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy Davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups If there is a ballot initiative in November to challenge the expected courtordered rate hikes it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state Legislation and Bail Out Bill ABX was heard for several hours in the Senate Appropriations yesterday Issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure specifically for communities that have harsh climates However the bill has received support from almost everyone including consumer groups The bill is expected to pass sometime today Tim Gage CA Director of Finance said Davis supports all the provisions in ABX and expected to sign Bill ABX was not heard in the Assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear today In committee hearings Monday the DWR testified it is spent all of the M and were spending Mday in the spot market to buy power According to sources with direct access to Governor Davis the ongoing court battle as discussed below is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a settlement Davis recognizes that the expected court ruling in the CPUC case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to California rate payers despite that ruling the state government has the ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the two utilities unless they come to terms Thus Davis believes that California consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity charges but he plans to use the threat of an appeal and a possible ballot initiative to limit the amount of the rate hikes A plan to exempt the lowest income smallest consumers from any rate increase and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using of a baseline usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in Sacramento That would still hit about one half of all consumers since the baseline is set at of average consumption but it is progressive in a politically important sense Making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night when PGE admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates The companys defense they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash was met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious efforts by Californians to use less electricity Every time you think theres a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves something like this happens one legislator moaned LongTerm Contracts A second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of longterm power buying contracts Davis initiated earlier this month The first wave of those contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be surprisingly positive according to officials in the talks We got a series of good offers in those initial proposals And some not so good ones one official told our source The idea is to announce the results of the first contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say you want in on this with these terms We think well eventually shake loose a lot of supply with this strategy Bankruptcy Because of these new dynamics there is improved market confidence that California will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for SoCal Edison and PGE even as they are set to miss another round of payments to creditors and suppliers today remember there is a standstill agreement among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until Feb We believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost by the court case in front of US District Judge Ronald SW Lew in Los Angeles which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week at the latest In fact without that political cover it would be impossible to square all the various circles of this crisis Audit Results and Ballot Initiatives Markets Bush administration officials and perhaps utility companies themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of l to bring all electricity generation back under state control The threat of a proposition initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission released in the last hours confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since midJanuary First the audit of SoCal Edison confirmed that billion of the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells power Second it confirmed that Edison electric paid nearly billion in profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even while it was going on a debtissuing binge The audit of PGE released late last night was even more damaging PGE management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis by not making deep spending cuts including scaling back management salaries The auditors also questioned the utilitys decision to funnel some billion of its profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks Basically they took the money and ran as State Senate Speaker Burton put it yesterday What appears to be Governor Gray Davis grudging acceptance of reality is actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough rate hikestaxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without triggering a new and far more damaging burst of populist outrage among a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making this all up There is no doubt that this use of money by SoCal Edison and the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the spirit of the deregulation law but that is irrelevant in popular political terms Were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by the court case discussed below these audits would make settlement extremely difficult Keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key to understanding the very complex game that Davis his advisers and senior legislators are now playing A ballot initiative would be a potential disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at reestablishing full public control over the electric utilities Even if the state and utilities successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during that prolonged period Thats something California cannot afford as businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate Court Battle Thus legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of the court case in Los Angeles that SoCal Edison and PGE are likely to win in midFebruary The court will most likely grant the two utilities billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders of consumers who would see bills rise by at least California politicians could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start of this extended drama political cover Davis will then have to rely on his political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the utilities to pass on something less than the full billion debt PGE and SoCal Edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they have accumulated since August last year when the PUC refused to let them raise prices even as electricity prices soared The court said the deregulation law was crystal clear when the two utilities had repaid socalled stranded costs they were free to begin charging whatever they needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power Although the utilities won this case the Judge stayed his order until February th at the state governments request As that deadline approaches an intense new negotiating round is under way On the one hand political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher electric prices the courts made me do it but on the other hand they also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would force electricity rates up by about on top of natural gas bills that have soared by about since last year Utility companies are playing this card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final bailout Well just wait until the court puts the order into effect in midFebruary then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and easily One tactic the state political officials are using in order to force a settlement is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the next couple of years One political official pointed out that they could keep the utilities from receiving their money this year next year or perhaps even the year after Sure we tell them they will probably win in court and get that money Eventually We are making them well aware that unless we have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the Supreme Court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least We dont think the creditors will be quite that patient

legislation introduced today whereby the state will try to save the utilities from bankruptcy by taking ownership of utilities hydro assets in exchange for rate increases Wednesday state receives bids from auction rate ranges are expected to be between and cents per kilowatt hour Mid week audit findings will be released audit expected to show PGEs utility subsidiary handed over B to the holding company The holding company used B to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock State commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible bankruptcy scenario Bankruptcy still very possible for both companies Davis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue solutions or bail out Legislation There will be continued discussion regarding bill ABX in the Senate today The discussion will focus on the rate cap of cents per kilowatt hour as well as the term Assemblyman Keeley the author indicated that he believed cents was a fantasy and impossible to obtain Today Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek will introduce legislation whereby the state would temporary or permanently take both PGE and Edisions hydroelectric facilities or transmission lines or both in exchange for keeping the utilities out of bankruptcy The state would allow PGE and Edison to impose rate increases however the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this month by the CPUC as an emergency surcharge The money collected from consumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state would then enter into longterm contracts with power generators Under the bill the state of California would control of all Californias electricity As you can imagine this legislation has not received unanimous praise According to recent corporate filings PGEs hydroelectric plants alone would be valued between and billion This amount just happens to be what Davis estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee once the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the billion in debt Davis is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help with about billion in debt while the utilities of course say the full billion should be covered On Wednesday state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come Davis insists there are already several bids for his cents per kilowatt hour ceiling though few agree with his opinion A handful of smaller independent electricity providers with about a share of California power market indicated Sunday night they would come down to less than eight cents or less than half of what they currently charge in return for the stability of long term contracts Because consumers pay about cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current PUC rules any hope California has to work off the back debts for these utilities lies in hitting something very close to Davis price cap without falling back on higher prices for consumers The level of bids will be particularly important since bond rating agencies moved to put the state of California on a Credit watch on Friday worried that there was no obvious longterm repayment plan for the billions of dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state Utilitys Audit By the middle of this week California auditors will release their findings about how much money PGE and SoCal Edison actually owe to institutions outside their own holding company structure This will define the limits of what the state will guarantee if they guarantee any of the debt The truly explosive part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years A source with knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last three years PGEs utility subsidiary handed over about billion to the holding company Of that total the holding company used billion to pay shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock Another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current power crisis when regulators at the time of deregulation under the direction of Former RGov Pete Wilson forced the two utilities to sell at least half of their powergenerating plants Auditors are expected to say that if the utilities still owned all these plants electricity would cost only cents a kilowatt hour compared with over cents an hour on average in December and January Bankruptcy The threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities Senior advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility companies that ended in bankruptcy As all the parties involved hunker down for another intensely political week they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy but to push this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an advantage Under such conditions the risks of one or more of the players fumbling and triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy is still quite high Californias political leaders order a series of independent analyses to determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy the state or the two utilities The short answer was that no one has any idea Below are the findings of the report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge Would the companies be eligible for Chapter style temporary bankruptcy Some of the advisors thought that PGE and Edisons finances were so bad that Chapter style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option Advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the companies into full liquidation This would most certainly be guaranteed chaos Could the bankruptcy court actually force the PUC to raise the price of electricity to consumers The legal basis for passing on rate increases to consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought particularly if there is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies And there is still the question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge If the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets seriously and finds that PGE and Edison cannot afford to buy electricity he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages If the utilities go into bankruptcy the first creditors in line would be the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges The state could become almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier one of the reasons why suppliers wont sell electricity on credit to these companies now If the two companies went bankrupt it would be the largest bankruptcies in history straining just about everyone involved in the process The corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets from the utility by the FERC for PGE and already in place for Edison may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies currently think This is particularly true if this weeks audit shows the two corporations transferring billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder dividend payments Davis Opinion polls show that Governor Gray Davis is getting high marks for his job and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits One of Davis concerns is according to a senior official in the Governors office that a deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so antiutility and antibusiness that it cripples future growth in the state According to a senior official No one thought Howard Jarvis and his property tax initiative would succeed in destroying our education system but he did with one just ballot line and a lot of popular revulsion The threat of direct popular action is at least as large now as then Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield is already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that individual electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay their debt through higher ratepayer bills This official goes on to say The anger at utility companies is so high here that almost anything Rosenfield could think of would pass and we couldnt do anything about it This threat has begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always appeared wide open to political leaders floating a bond issue or a guarantee for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next several years

shortterm power purchases with no price cap through Febnd New legislation ABX and SBX would seek longterm contracts with cent cap and creation of California Power and Conservation Financing Authority

powers to finance new generation capacity and conservation measures Negotiations under way on using bond authority for a utility bailoututilities and state government split over debt obligations of utility parents State borrowing plans and power purchases create credit risks for state treasury SoCal Edison misses more payments Bush Administration opposes price caps but is supporting state efforts to split PGE into separate gas and electricity companies in order to assure continued gas supply Absent urgent passage of a bailout plan or an agreement on longerterm contracts utility bankruptcy is still the most likely scenario For further information contact Robert Johnston x or Kristin Walsh x Legislation Passes ShortTerm Measures SBX passed the California State Senate easily As we said yesterday the bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the Department of Water and Resources until February nd The Department will have million available to finance power purchases but there expectations that these costs could easily rise to billion by next week ABX has evolved into a longerterm solution and in its current form would authorize the Department of Water and Resources to enter into longterm contracts as opposed to the day contracts in SBX to buy power at a price cap of cents per kwh This legislation is not expected to pass today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week period covered by SBX when negotiations between generators the utilities and the state are likely to resume SBX What Will the State Do With the Bond Authority A second piece of legislation currently under consideration SB Xhas created uncertainty in the markets This legislation will create a California Power and Conservation Financing Authority with bond issuance authority The uncertainty concerns whether the new authority will address the problem of the billion in outstanding debt owed by the utilities The current text of the legislation focuses only on longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving efficiency Yet the legislation also says the authority may issue bonds exercise power of eminent domain and enter into joint power agreements and buy own and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a project The general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of either issuing bonds to finance past debts or using eminent domain or the bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a Ch proceeding While neither Davis nor Senate leader Burton are talking about a full billion bailout at this point the idea of using bond money to pay past debts continues to circulate in the legislature One of the reasons none of the utility creditors have moved to demand repayment is that they are being quietly reassured by the Governors office that there will be a governmentsupported debt workout in the near future Bailout Could Depend on Parents of Utilities Absorbing Losses The big problem and one which have kept the Governor nor the utility companies from opting for this solution is a massive battle over how much of the outstanding billion in back debt the holding companies of the two utilities will absorb in any restructuring deal As we have reported something like half of that debt is owed by the utilities to their own sister powergenerating companies within their holding company structure the partial deregulation allowed the utilities to split into powergenerating and powerdistributing companies so one side of the holding company buys power from the other side and public opinion polls show overwhelming majorities understand this quite well Davis wants the utility companies to acknowledge the nature of this debt and to absorb some substantial part of the internal debt within their corporate structures we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or issue bonds to deal with the rest As one very senior California political leader explained getting the utility holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread public outrage about a bailout of private pricegouging companies with taxpayer money Since of Californians currently blame the utilities and the PUC for this crisis and only blame Davis this is a crucial political stance for the Governor But of course absorbing anything like billion in debt would be quite a shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and powergenerating branches of the two utilities and they began spreading the word that they were quite willing to accept bankruptcy Thus by midweek both sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court that would be a worst case solution for all sides The countrys economy would suffer from the resulting credit shock the Governors political future would suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a bankruptcy judge while most private sector legal authorities believe the utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during bankruptcy procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of the debt in the end In addition they would most likely face a state government determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in a major way Senator Burtons SBX legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically to make this point quite explicit It would set up a California Power and Conservation Financing Authority with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent domain It would finance new power plants and consider the feasibility and public interest of the state acquiring operating and maintaining transmission facilities currently owned by investorowned and municipal utilities As we write this all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the bankruptcy ledge to safe ground and there is no question the tone has shifted in the last hours from macho confrontation to maybe weve run this thing out as far as we can But as we have noted the chance for miscalculation is still quite high There is no solution agreed to at this time the standoff over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities holding company is continuing and the technical fact of default still makes it possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate accelerated payment Default Update Thursday SoCal Edison million default to California Power Exchange After Edison failed to make a M electricity payment yesterday the California Power Authority began seizing longterm contacts and reselling them to recoup some of the money owed to generators PGE said it expects its trading privileges at the Cal Power Authority to be suspended today leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources While the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted PGEs and SoCals ability to buy power the Department of Water and Resources will be able to pick up some of the slack at least in the very shortterm The state itself may be getting into risky credit territory The proposed California Public Power Authority would borrow in the neighborhood of billion from the state General Fund in advance of this years expected fiscal surplus with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future revenues With nearbankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes it is unclear where the revenues would come from The amount borrowed and terms of repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating agencies Bush Policies As we reported on Wednesday the Bush Administration continues to demonstrate little interest in getting involved in the California crisis PresidentElect Bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root of the current supply shortage Bush and his top officials appear to be unanimously opposed to longterm price caps However there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration according to a source close to a top Bush economic advisor There is significant concern that PGEs credit problems could cause gas suppliers to stop shipments of gas through PGEs pipeline The risk would be that the pipeline could go dry causing significant and possibly dangerous disruptions in California residences and businesses To prevent this problem Bush is working with Davis on a proposal to split PGE into separate gas and electric companies The gas company would be solvent but the electric company would go immediately into Ch following significant defaults

the state Legislation and Bail Out Bill ABX was heard for several hours in the Senate Appropriations yesterday Issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure specifically for communities that have harsh climates However the bill has received support from almost everyone including consumer groups The bill is expected to pass sometime today Tim Gage CA Director of Finance said Davis supports all the provisions in ABX and expected to sign Bill ABX was not heard in the Assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear today In committee hearings Monday the DWR testified it is spent all of the M and were spending Mday in the spot market to buy power According to sources with direct access to Governor Davis the ongoing court battle as discussed below is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a settlement Davis recognizes that the expected court ruling in the CPUC case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to California rate payers despite that ruling the state government has the ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the two utilities unless they come to terms Thus Davis believes that California consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity charges but he plans to use the threat of an appeal and a possible ballot initiative to limit the amount of the rate hikes A plan to exempt the lowest income smallest consumers from any rate increase and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using of a baseline usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in Sacramento That would still hit about one half of all consumers since the baseline is set at of average consumption but it is progressive in a politically important sense Making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night when PGE admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates The companys defense they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash was met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious efforts by Californians to use less electricity Every time you think theres a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves something like this happens one legislator moaned LongTerm Contracts A second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of longterm power buying contracts Davis initiated earlier this month The first wave of those contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be surprisingly positive according to officials in the talks We got a series of good offers in those initial proposals And some not so good ones one official told our source The idea is to announce the results of the first contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say you want in on this with these terms We think well eventually shake loose a lot of supply with this strategy Bankruptcy Because of these new dynamics there is improved market confidence that California will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for SoCal Edison and PGE even as they are set to miss another round of payments to creditors and suppliers today remember there is a standstill agreement among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until Feb We believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost by the court case in front of US District Judge Ronald SW Lew in Los Angeles which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week at the latest In fact without that political cover it would be impossible to square all the various circles of this crisis Audit Results and Ballot Initiatives Markets Bush administration officials and perhaps utility companies themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of l to bring all electricity generation back under state control The threat of a proposition initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission released in the last hours confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since midJanuary First the audit of SoCal Edison confirmed that billion of the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells power Second it confirmed that Edison electric paid nearly billion in profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even while it was going on a debtissuing binge The audit of PGE released late last night was even more damaging PGE management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis by not making deep spending cuts including scaling back management salaries The auditors also questioned the utilitys decision to funnel some billion of its profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks Basically they took the money and ran as State Senate Speaker Burton put it yesterday What appears to be Governor Gray Davis grudging acceptance of reality is actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough rate hikestaxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without triggering a new and far more damaging burst of populist outrage among a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making this all up There is no doubt that this use of money by SoCal Edison and the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the spirit of the deregulation law but that is irrelevant in popular political terms Were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by the court case discussed below these audits would make settlement extremely difficult Keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key to understanding the very complex game that Davis his advisers and senior legislators are now playing A ballot initiative would be a potential disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at reestablishing full public control over the electric utilities Even if the state and utilities successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during that prolonged period Thats something California cannot afford as businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate Court Battle Thus legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of the court case in Los Angeles that SoCal Edison and PGE are likely to win in midFebruary The court will most likely grant the two utilities billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders of consumers who would see bills rise by at least California politicians could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start of this extended drama political cover Davis will then have to rely on his political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the utilities to pass on something less than the full billion debt PGE and SoCal Edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they have accumulated since August last year when the PUC refused to let them raise prices even as electricity prices soared The court said the deregulation law was crystal clear when the two utilities had repaid socalled stranded costs they were free to begin charging whatever they needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power Although the utilities won this case the Judge stayed his order until February th at the state governments request As that deadline approaches an intense new negotiating round is under way On the one hand political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher electric prices the courts made me do it but on the other hand they also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would force electricity rates up by about on top of natural gas bills that have soared by about since last year Utility companies are playing this card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final bailout Well just wait until the court puts the order into effect in midFebruary then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and easily One tactic the state political officials are using in order to force a settlement is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the next couple of years One political official pointed out that they could keep the utilities from receiving their money this year next year or perhaps even the year after Sure we tell them they will probably win in court and get that money Eventually We are making them well aware that unless we have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the Supreme Court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least We dont think the creditors will be quite that patient

due to a one day optout clause in all longterm power contracts PGE and State locked in tough negotiations several issues on the table PUCimposed requirement forcing PGE to ultimately be responsible for California energy supplies Price of the grid state times book value vs PGE times book value PGE will not use any of the B secured last week to help their ailing utility Daviss announcement of long term power contract didnt include some details Of the megawatts secured this far only are available this summer Some of the long term contracts are really only for three months None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot market One the same day Davis announced long term contracts Davis also quietly announce a rate hike FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal PGE Transmissions deal One thing that is still uncertain is PGE Bankruptcy may still be a likely alternative if current negotiations to buy PGEs share of the electric transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April when all longterm power contracts being negotiated have a oneday optout clause they can exercise unilaterally if a comprehensive solution has not been reached by the state and its major utilities According to sources close to senior PGE officials PGE made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal on the transmission lines depends on the California governments willingness to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make until now PGE will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to relieve it of the PUCimposed requirement to be the electricity buyer of last resort Current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all times to supply Californias energy needs As long as the state steps in and makes those purchases as it has for the past three months the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings But PGE officials are worried this summers supply and Daviss concern over how fast he is draining the states budget surplus If things get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity it buys through longterm contracts then PGE will be left holding the bag Thus as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid PGE is demanding a comprehensive solution that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed to pay State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of get out of jail free card so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough negotiations that are complicated by three other factors PGEs public behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy State legislative demands that the price Davis negotiate for PGEs part of the electricity grid be no more than times revenues from the grid and the FERC must positively approve any grid purchase by the state of California The principal concern on the price front is that PGE wants to sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their transmission while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the politically acceptable limit We see times book value as an absolute upper bound There is no way PGE will get more than that whatever they think according to the leader of one main consumer groups We are going to try to force any deals down to about in any case Negotiators for Davis are also trying to propositionproof any transmission deal to protect against a later ballot proposal They think there are ways to do that but not if the price of PGEs part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative Remember if Daviss eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative he will be running for reelection on the same ballot as a public initiative designed to overturn his solution On the Sacramento front no one understands PGEs motives The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game PGE is playing In a three day period PGE made a series of announcements that left everyone scratching their heads Late Thursday PGE officials leaked information to California papers that they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity transmission grid to the state which seemed like obvious good news but then made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least above what the state was currently offering While a deal can still be done anything like the billion PGE wants would be very hard to get through the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase Late Friday PGE officials announced that they had secured a billion loan for the parent company not the electricity utility and would use the money to pay off bondholders other creditors and to return million to shareholders in a new dividend payout Not a cent of that money was earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PGE and that left at least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood Over the weekend PGE leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay off its energy suppliers debt for cents on the dollar right now For generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will make them whole in a couple of months that kind of trial balloon is extremely unnerving Thus in a very short time period PGEs corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at least a part of the billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and PGEs fundraising will harden and deepen those demands As one senior political official told our source just when you think the corporate leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible they come up with something even more outrageous PGEs actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to construct to solve Californias problems State Democrats doubt they will get Republican support for a deal which means a vote will fall short of the twothirds majority necessary for immediate enactment resulting in days for the legislation to go into effect Additionally in the past hours many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the electricity grid Longterm Contracts Davis didnt tell the whole truth Yesterday Davis announced that he had signed longterm power deals for megawatts of power out of a total megawatts he wanted to sign eventually According to the press release Davis is now of the way toward his longterm goal and has already solved the hardest part of Californias energy crisis This means consumers would maybe pay more than necessary five years from now but these contracts guaranteed that consumers would pay less for the next three years What Davis failed to highlight was that of the megawatt commitment actually only megawatts are available this summer when demand is expected to megawatts and some of these longterm contracts are actually only good for three months None of these contracts however keep California from having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year While the media was concern with Daviss announcement of long term contracts for California of less concern to the media was Daviss quietly announced a decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers The state will accept the emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a permanent increase as well as an additional increase for consumers that will take effect early when the old rate cut legislation expires That would bring the average charge to about cents a kilowatt hour FERC The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve it in a positive vote Senior California officials and legislators doubt that FERC has jurisdiction and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal But they may be wrong The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs off on the deal Its power over transmission deal is absolute no matter what anyone says according to source close to the President There are three possibilities FERC could pocket veto it by not even putting it on agenda for discussion the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted down The Democrat on the commission William Massey has already said he is opposed to it or the Commission could approve it but with condition that Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system One complicating factor in the FERC decision however is that its chairman Curt Hebert who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale may not be around long enough to have his say Hebert is definitely not a shoo in for the FERC chairman position says one Washington official Two other appointments to the Commission will soon be named this official notes and one of them could easily become chairman

Executive Summary FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives Politically Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis from an economic perspective he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan most notably its exclusion of outofstate generators June st kill clause for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected billion power bill this summereconomic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement QF bid for advance payments from PGE likely to fail in bankruptcy court New generation delays probable because of StateQF squabbling Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal FERC Fallout The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action but is not Rather it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame Once they are politically inoculated the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions Moreover the Administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan Something Less than Effective Price Caps From Daviss point of view the FERC plan has four major flaws The order applies only to California not to the rest of the west NonCalifornia generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California As the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage emergency and does not require any collusion Even when the price caps kick in they are based on the costplus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap The generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control If Davis doesnt sign on to the regional grid by June st then he will have to live with June nd headlines blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California could therefore pay as much as billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of PGE and SCE These sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the FERC andor the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about days One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for longterm power deals The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture The countrys largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PGE Meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the QFs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted If the QFs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the mw of gasfired QF capacity will remain offline Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for longterm contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the MOU for the SCE bailout plan The analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points For example one of the elements of the MOU is a nonbypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid This is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity This makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds According to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company For this and other reasons even if the Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose LongTerm Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to disclose the details of the longterm power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis Even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay

Meet Their May th Deadline Due to Lack of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuancebridge loan by the May th deadline Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart According to sources both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis The Democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund Davis would double dip into the fund Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor However it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place Additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the longterm power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by July If not the state may be in breach of contract Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May th having a bond issuance by July st will be very difficult The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately billion However the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan AB X and AB X AB X authorizes the DWR to sell up to billion in bonds This bill passed the Senate in March but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support AB X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts However sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen currently in AB X Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund For instance Tony Strickland has stated that only of the bonds or approximately billion should be issued Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday Additionally Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount B Lenders JP Morgan B Lehman Brothers B Bear Stearns M Tax Exempt Portion Of the B B is expected to be taxexempt Projected Interest Rate Taxable Rate TaxExempt Rate Current Projected Blended IR Maturity Date August For more details please contact me at Bill SB X Passed the Senate Yesterday but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB X yesterday which authorizes billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority The billion authorized under SB X is not the same as the billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward Again the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations Without the details of the longterm power contracts the governor has negotiated the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power Also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the California Public Power and Conservation Authority However this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August th however some decision will likely be made earlier According to sources the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal though SoCal has signed it The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash The second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB X bridge loan stating that the DWR would received of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount In other words the state will get paid before the utilities If this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments

powers to finance new generation capacity and conservation measures Negotiations under way on using bond authority for a utility bailoututilities and state government split over debt obligations of utility parents State borrowing plans and power purchases create credit risks for state treasury SoCal Edison misses more payments Bush Administration opposes price caps but is supporting state

bankruptcy is still the most likely scenario For further information contact Robert Johnston x or Kristin Walsh x Legislation Passes ShortTerm Measures SBX passed the California State Senate easily As we said yesterday the bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the Department of Water and Resources until February nd The Department will have million available to finance power purchases but there expectations that these costs could easily rise to billion by next week ABX has evolved into a longerterm solution and in its current form would authorize the Department of Water and Resources to enter into longterm contracts as opposed to the day contracts in SBX to buy power at a price cap of cents per kwh This legislation is not expected to pass today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week period covered by SBX when negotiations between generators the utilities and the state are likely to resume SBX What Will the State Do With the Bond Authority A second piece of legislation currently under consideration SB Xhas created uncertainty in the markets This legislation will create a California Power and Conservation Financing Authority with bond issuance authority The uncertainty concerns whether the new authority will address the problem of the billion in outstanding debt owed by the utilities The current text of the legislation focuses only on longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving efficiency Yet the legislation also says the authority may issue bonds exercise power of eminent domain and enter into joint power agreements and buy own and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a project The general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of either issuing bonds to finance past debts or using eminent domain or the bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a Ch proceeding While neither Davis nor Senate leader Burton are talking about a full billion bailout at this point the idea of using bond money to pay past debts continues to circulate in the legislature One of the reasons none of the utility creditors have moved to demand repayment is that they are being quietly reassured by the Governors office that there will be a governmentsupported debt workout in the near future Bailout Could Depend on Parents of Utilities Absorbing Losses The big problem and one which have kept the Governor nor the utility companies from opting for this solution is a massive battle over how much of the outstanding billion in back debt the holding companies of the two utilities will absorb in any restructuring deal As we have reported something like half of that debt is owed by the utilities to their own sister powergenerating companies within their holding company structure the partial deregulation allowed the utilities to split into powergenerating and powerdistributing companies so one side of the holding company buys power from the other side and public opinion polls show overwhelming majorities understand this quite well Davis wants the utility companies to acknowledge the nature of this debt and to absorb some substantial part of the internal debt within their corporate structures we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or issue bonds to deal with the rest As one very senior California political leader explained getting the utility holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread public outrage about a bailout of private pricegouging companies with taxpayer money Since of Californians currently blame the utilities and the PUC for this crisis and only blame Davis this is a crucial political stance for the Governor But of course absorbing anything like billion in debt would be quite a shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and powergenerating branches of the two utilities and they began spreading the word that they were quite willing to accept bankruptcy Thus by midweek both sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court that would be a worst case solution for all sides The countrys economy would suffer from the resulting credit shock the Governors political future would suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a bankruptcy judge while most private sector legal authorities believe the utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during bankruptcy procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of the debt in the end In addition they would most likely face a state government determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in a major way Senator Burtons SBX legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically to make this point quite explicit It would set up a California Power and Conservation Financing Authority with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent domain It would finance new power plants and consider the feasibility and public interest of the state acquiring operating and maintaining transmission facilities currently owned by investorowned and municipal utilities As we write this all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the bankruptcy ledge to safe ground and there is no question the tone has shifted in the last hours from macho confrontation to maybe weve run this thing out as far as we can But as we have noted the chance for miscalculation is still quite high There is no solution agreed to at this time the standoff over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities holding company is continuing and the technical fact of default still makes it possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate accelerated payment Default Update Thursday SoCal Edison million default to California Power Exchange After Edison failed to make a M electricity payment yesterday the California Power Authority began seizing longterm contacts and reselling them to recoup some of the money owed to generators PGE said it expects its trading privileges at the Cal Power Authority to be suspended today leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources While the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted PGEs and SoCals ability to buy power the Department of Water and Resources will be able to pick up some of the slack at least in the very shortterm The state itself may be getting into risky credit territory The proposed California Public Power Authority would borrow in the neighborhood of billion from the state General Fund in advance of this years expected fiscal surplus with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future revenues With nearbankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes it is unclear where the revenues would come from The amount borrowed and terms of repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating agencies Bush Policies As we reported on Wednesday the Bush Administration continues to demonstrate little interest in getting involved in the California crisis PresidentElect Bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root of the current supply shortage Bush and his top officials appear to be unanimously opposed to longterm price caps However there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration according to a source close to a top Bush economic advisor There is significant concern that PGEs credit problems could cause gas suppliers to stop shipments of gas through PGEs pipeline The risk would be that the pipeline could go dry causing significant and possibly dangerous disruptions in California residences and businesses To prevent this problem Bush is working with Davis on a proposal to split PGE into separate gas and electric companies The gas company would be solvent but the electric company would go immediately into Ch following significant defaults

Meet Their May th Deadline Due to Lack of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuancebridge loan by the May th deadline Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart According to sources both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis The Democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund Davis would double dip into the fund Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor However it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place Additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the longterm power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by July If not the state may be in breach of contract Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May th having a bond issuance by July st will be very difficult The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately billion However the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan AB X and AB X AB X authorizes the DWR to sell up to billion in bonds This bill passed the Senate in March but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support AB X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts However sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen currently in AB X Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund For instance Tony Strickland has stated that only of the bonds or approximately billion should be issued Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday Additionally Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount B Lenders JP Morgan B Lehman Brothers B Bear Stearns M Tax Exempt Portion Of the B B is expected to be taxexempt Projected Interest Rate Taxable Rate TaxExempt Rate Current Projected Blended IR Maturity Date August For more details please contact me at Bill SB X Passed the Senate Yesterday but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB X yesterday which authorizes billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority The billion authorized under SB X is not the same as the billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward Again the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations Without the details of the longterm power contracts the governor has negotiated the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power Also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the California Public Power and Conservation Authority However this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August th however some decision will likely be made earlier According to sources the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal though SoCal has signed it The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash The second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB X bridge loan stating that the DWR would received of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount In other words the state will get paid before the utilities If this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments

Executive Summary FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives Politically Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis from an economic perspective he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan most notably its exclusion of outofstate generators June st kill clause for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected billion power bill this summereconomic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement QF bid for advance payments from PGE likely to fail in bankruptcy court New generation delays probable because of StateQF squabbling Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal FERC Fallout The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action but is not Rather it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame Once they are politically inoculated the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions Moreover the Administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan Something Less than Effective Price Caps From Daviss point of view the FERC plan has four major flaws The order applies only to California not to the rest of the west NonCalifornia generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California As the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage emergency and does not require any collusion Even when the price caps kick in they are based on the costplus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap The generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control If Davis doesnt sign on to the regional grid by June st then he will have to live with June nd headlines blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California could therefore pay as much as billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of PGE and SCE These sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the FERC andor the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about days One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for longterm power deals The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture The countrys largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PGE Meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the QFs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted If the QFs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the mw of gasfired QF capacity will remain offline Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for longterm contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the MOU for the SCE bailout plan The analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points For example one of the elements of the MOU is a nonbypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid This is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity This makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds According to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company For this and other reasons even if the Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose LongTerm Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to disclose the details of the longterm power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis Even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay

deal going through is a onetime quick vote if deal has t o go to hearings it will probably die If not transmission deal legislators will seize assets and seek price ca ps Asset seizure would target power contracts then power plants as a resul t the endless court battles will ensue but this gives Davis opportunity to continue to blame generators and marketers Bankruptcy for SoCal is still the most likely scenario with the QFs or SoCal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended Congressional democrats rally around Davis and seize opportunity to blame the Administration Transmission Deal and Democratic Support As Governor Gray Davis scrambles to build support for his SoCal Ed transmission proposal one thing is evident the longer the deal is exposed to public debate the less likely it is to pass In fact politicians have been so leery of the deal that Davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor to introduce the bill in the Senate In the eyes of many Democrati c legislators and all Republicans forcing SoCal Edison into bankruptcy is looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines that is wh y the Governors senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick up or down vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week The bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoi d debate however if there is an opening within the next two weeks and Davis feels he has enough support it will be pushed through Because the SoCal deal needs every piece in place as negotiated by Davis team the team wants no amendments allowed on the Assembly floor and a quick vote If thi s unlikely fast track strategy fails for Davis the prospects for the transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily keep in mind that th at it cannot even be resubmitted to the Assembly until it has been vetted by SoCal Edison attorneys According to sources the legislature is going to try to modify the Memorandum of Understanding between Gov Davis and SCE However the Senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to pass even a modified MOU Burton reportedly believes that at lea st Democrats will vote against it along with the Republicans The more that bill gets picked apart in public the uglier it looks and the more Democrat s will realize that they are all alone in supporting it Another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of SoCal and not the state Among other things the state is overpaying by about billion for the transmission lines Additionally the MOU Davis has with SoCal Ed nearly matches point for point the deal Davis condemned with PG E Asset Seizures Since before the PGE bankruptcy filing we have maintained that asset seizures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasing ly frustrated Democrats Davis legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law on eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across California to existing power contracts negotiated by whom Daviss calls profiteering power brokers Of course everyone in the Governors office understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal courts and would be a legal nightmare there are a few minor Constitutiona l legal and interstate commerce problems The main thing is that the seizing would continue Daviss main approach to this problem management by press conference and it would put the Governor and Democrats on the right side of the issue punishing the capitalist leeches According to one senior Democratic legislator there is movement within Democratic members of the state Assembly to demand that Davis agree to seize the power contracts in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase Of cours e taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking the power plants The appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would allegedly put California state officials in charge of where the power is sold and reduce markups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide spotmarket power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the pric e through the roof Price Caps One strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur depends powerfully on decisions made by the three Republican Governors from Colorado Alaska and Wyoming These three were the key players during the Portland Western Governors Conference last January and according to senio r White House officials it took the personal and prolonged intervention of President Bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous call for price caps from the governors If they had signed that price cap appeal the administration source said we would already have price caps So if they start to make it clear something has changed we will have to listen Sources indicate that if these Republican leaders begin to rethin k their opposition to price caps the Bush administration will be forced to reconsider price caps as a remedy for the West Cost Plus Caps Think of these as Republican price caps in that their fir st duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to provide power into the affected grid Just to give some idea of magnitudes in a cost plus deal current discussions would put a cap on power costs at something like per kilowatt hour That is a long way down from the August futures contract that is pricing in per kilowatt hour but a lo ng way above last Augusts kwhr price and a particularly long way above t he cost of generating this power which is something like kwh MarketPrice Exceptions The option allows the Bush administration to hav e political credit for imposing price caps As we write FERC is currently i n the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generating power in California Duke Dynegy AES Reliant and Williams The permit grants a further threeyear waiver that allows them to sell power into California in the existing whatever price the market will bear In other words FERC could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy at the market price perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market share and then power to control prices would revert back to FERC Technically in granting the extension of these permits FERC has to establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield mark et power that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding power at crucial times Of course FERC has just found on three different rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the subsequent price spikes But that would mean FERC would have to want to wie ld effective power over price capping in California and they have shown no desire on that front The escape clause for FERC simply to renew the waiver s is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than of an electricity market and none of these companies come close In other words the waivers option lets FERC escape if the Bush administration and FERC commissioners really want to escape Once again th at decision may be more in the hands of the three Republican Governors than anywhere else in the country But you can be certain that in the past few days Administration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabilities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plants Democrats Seize Opportunity to blame Bush Senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could come in as high as billion which would destroy state finances for a decade Add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear everyday about their own direct outofpocket electricity costs they paid billion for electricity in billion in and are expected to pa y billion this year ten times the rate two years ago Then of course they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredible numbers home in a very direct way and well who can blame the Democrats f or saying there is a simple solution but the White House wont allow it National level Democrats realize Californias power crisis is a prime opportunity to chastise the Bush administration and its freemarket advocat e FERC Chairman Hebert over their resistance to summer price caps As Californias leaders calculate this years taxpayer energy bill at potentially billion a rogues gallery of Democratic congressional leaders are currently meeting with Governor Davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across the eight western states of the power grid with a singular message the solution to all western voters electricity problems lies righ t in Washington DC at FERC headquarters controlled by Bush Administration appointees And as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its possible impact on control over the US Congress comes more into focus the solutions articulated by Californias Democrats who sense they have Republicans on the run in the West become less and less fr ee market focused The two strains of the Democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps

Meet Their May th Deadline Due to Lack of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuancebridge loan by the May th deadline Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart According to sources both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis The Democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund Davis would double dip into the fund Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor However it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place Additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the longterm power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by July If not the state may be in breach of contract Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May th having a bond issuance by July st will be very difficult The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately billion However the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan AB X and AB X AB X authorizes the DWR to sell up to billion in bonds This bill passed the Senate in March but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support AB X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts However sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen currently in AB X Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund For instance Tony Strickland has stated that only of the bonds or approximately billion should be issued Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday Additionally Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount B Lenders JP Morgan B Lehman Brothers B Bear Stearns M Tax Exempt Portion Of the B B is expected to be taxexempt Projected Interest Rate Taxable Rate TaxExempt Rate Current Projected Blended IR Maturity Date August For more details please contact me at Bill SB X Passed the Senate Yesterday but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB X yesterday which authorizes billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority The billion authorized under SB X is not the same as the billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward Again the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations Without the details of the longterm power contracts the governor has negotiated the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power Also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the California Public Power and Conservation Authority However this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August th however some decision will likely be made earlier According to sources the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal though SoCal has signed it The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash The second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB X bridge loan stating that the DWR would received of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount In other words the state will get paid before the utilities If this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments

Executive Summary FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives Politically Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis from an economic perspective he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan most notably its exclusion of outofstate generators June st kill clause for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected billion power bill this summereconomic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement QF bid for advance payments from PGE likely to fail in bankruptcy court New generation delays probable because of StateQF squabbling Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal FERC Fallout The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action but is not Rather it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame Once they are politically inoculated the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions Moreover the Administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan Something Less than Effective Price Caps From Daviss point of view the FERC plan has four major flaws The order applies only to California not to the rest of the west NonCalifornia generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California As the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage emergency and does not require any collusion Even when the price caps kick in they are based on the costplus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap The generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control If Davis doesnt sign on to the regional grid by June st then he will have to live with June nd headlines blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California could therefore pay as much as billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of PGE and SCE These sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the FERC andor the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about days One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for longterm power deals The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture The countrys largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PGE Meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the QFs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted If the QFs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the mw of gasfired QF capacity will remain offline Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for longterm contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the MOU for the SCE bailout plan The analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points For example one of the elements of the MOU is a nonbypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid This is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity This makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds According to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company For this and other reasons even if the Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose LongTerm Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to disclose the details of the longterm power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis Even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay

power contracts then power plants as a resul t the endless court battles will ensue but this gives Davis opportunity to continue to blame generators and marketers Bankruptcy for SoCal is still the most likely scenario with the QFs or SoCal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended Congressional democrats rally around Davis and seize opportunity to blame the Administration Transmission Deal and Democratic Support As Governor Gray Davis scrambles to build support for his SoCal Ed transmission proposal one thing is evident the longer the deal is exposed to public debate the less likely it is to pass In fact politicians have been so leery of the deal that Davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor to introduce the bill in the Senate In the eyes of many Democrati c legislators and all Republicans forcing SoCal Edison into bankruptcy is looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines that is wh y the Governors senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick up or down vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week The bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoi d debate however if there is an opening within the next two weeks and Davis feels he has enough support it will be pushed through Because the SoCal deal needs every piece in place as negotiated by Davis team the team wants no amendments allowed on the Assembly floor and a quick vote If thi s unlikely fast track strategy fails for Davis the prospects for the transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily keep in mind that th at it cannot even be resubmitted to the Assembly until it has been vetted by SoCal Edison attorneys According to sources the legislature is going to try to modify the Memorandum of Understanding between Gov Davis and SCE However the Senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to pass even a modified MOU Burton reportedly believes that at lea

supporting it Another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of SoCal and not the state Among other things the state is overpaying by about billion for the transmission lines Additionally the MOU Davis has with SoCal Ed nearly matches point for point the deal Davis condemned with PG E Asset Seizures Since before the PGE bankruptcy filing we have maintained that asset seizures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasing ly frustrated Democrats Davis legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law on eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across California to existing power contracts negotiated by whom Daviss calls profiteering power brokers Of course everyone in the Governors office understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal courts and would be a legal nightmare there are a few minor Constitutiona l legal and interstate commerce problems The main thing is that the seizing would continue Daviss main approach to this problem management by press conference and it would put the Governor and Democrats on the right side of the issue punishing the capitalist leeches According to one senior Democratic legislator there is movement within Democratic members of the state Assembly to demand that Davis agree to seize the power contracts in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase Of cours e taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking the power plants The appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would allegedly put California state officials in charge of where the power is sold and reduce markups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide spotmarket power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the pric e through the roof Price Caps One strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur depends powerfully on decisions made by the three Republican Governors from Colorado Alaska and Wyoming These three were the key players during the Portland Western Governors Conference last January and according to senio r White House officials it took the personal and prolonged intervention of President Bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous call for price caps from the governors If they had signed that price cap appeal the administration

waiver that allows them to sell power into California in the existing whatever price the market will bear In other words FERC could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy at the market price perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market share and then power to control prices would revert back to FERC Technically in granting the extension of these permits FERC has to establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield mark et power that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding power at crucial times Of course FERC has just found on three different rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the subsequent price spikes But that would mean FERC would have to want to wie ld effective power over price capping in California and they have shown no desire on that front The escape clause for FERC simply to renew the waiver s is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than of an electricity market and none of these companies come close In other words the waivers option lets FERC escape if the Bush administration and FERC commissioners really want to escape Once again th at decision may be more in the hands of the three Republican Governors than anywhere else in the

takes on a more aggressive national tone and its possible impact on control over the US Congress comes more into focus the solutions articulated by Californias Democrats who sense they have Republicans on the run in the West become less and less fr ee market focused The two strains of the Democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps

Executive Summary FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives Politically Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis from an economic perspective he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan most notably its exclusion of outofstate generators June st kill clause for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected billion power bill this summereconomic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement QF bid for advance payments from PGE likely to fail in bankruptcy court New generation delays probable because of StateQF squabbling Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal FERC Fallout The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action but is not Rather it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame Once they are politically inoculated the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions Moreover the Administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan Something Less than Effective Price Caps From Daviss point of view the FERC plan has four major flaws The order applies only to California not to the rest of the west NonCalifornia generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California As the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage emergency and does not require any collusion Even when the price caps kick in they are based on the costplus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap The generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control If Davis doesnt sign on to the regional grid by June st then he will have to live with June nd headlines blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California could therefore pay as much as billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of PGE and SCE These sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the FERC andor the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about days One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for longterm power deals The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture The countrys largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PGE Meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the QFs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted If the QFs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the mw of gasfired QF capacity will remain offline Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for longterm contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the MOU for the SCE bailout plan The analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points For example one of the elements of the MOU is a nonbypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid This is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity This makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds According to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company For this and other reasons even if the Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose LongTerm Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to disclose the details of the longterm power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis Even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay

Meet Their May th Deadline Due to Lack of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuancebridge loan by the May th deadline Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart According to sources both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis The Democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund Davis would double dip into the fund Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor However it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place Additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the longterm power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by July If not the state may be in breach of contract Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May th having a bond issuance by July st will be very difficult The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately billion However the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan AB X and AB X AB X authorizes the DWR to sell up to billion in bonds This bill passed the Senate in March but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support AB X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts However sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen currently in AB X Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund For instance Tony Strickland has stated that only of the bonds or approximately billion should be issued Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday Additionally Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount B Lenders JP Morgan B Lehman Brothers B Bear Stearns M Tax Exempt Portion Of the B B is expected to be taxexempt Projected Interest Rate Taxable Rate TaxExempt Rate Current Projected Blended IR Maturity Date August For more details please contact me at Bill SB X Passed the Senate Yesterday but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB X yesterday which authorizes billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority The billion authorized under SB X is not the same as the billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward Again the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations Without the details of the longterm power contracts the governor has negotiated the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power Also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the California Public Power and Conservation Authority However this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August th however some decision will likely be made earlier According to sources the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal though SoCal has signed it The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash The second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB X bridge loan stating that the DWR would received of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount In other words the state will get paid before the utilities If this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments

Executive Summary FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives Politically Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis from an economic perspective he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan most notably its exclusion of outofstate generators June st kill clause for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected billion power bill this summereconomic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement QF bid for advance payments from PGE likely to fail in bankruptcy court New generation delays probable because of StateQF squabbling Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal FERC Fallout The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action but is not Rather it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame Once they are politically inoculated the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions Moreover the Administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan Something Less than Effective Price Caps From Daviss point of view the FERC plan has four major flaws The order applies only to California not to the rest of the west NonCalifornia generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California As the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage emergency and does not require any collusion Even when the price caps kick in they are based on the costplus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap The generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control If Davis doesnt sign on to the regional grid by June st then he will have to live with June nd headlines blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California could therefore pay as much as billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of PGE and SCE These sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the FERC andor the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about days One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for longterm power deals The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture The countrys largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PGE Meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the QFs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted If the QFs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the mw of gasfired QF capacity will remain offline Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for longterm contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the MOU for the SCE bailout plan The analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points For example one of the elements of the MOU is a nonbypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid This is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity This makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds According to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company For this and other reasons even if the Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose LongTerm Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to disclose the details of the longterm power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis Even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay

deal going through is a onetime quick vote if deal has t o go to hearings it will probably die If not transmission deal legislators will seize assets and seek price ca ps Asset seizure would target power contracts then power plants as a resul t the endless court battles will ensue but this gives Davis opportunity to continue to blame generators and marketers Bankruptcy for SoCal is still the most likely scenario with the QFs or SoCal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended Congressional democrats rally around Davis and seize opportunity to blame the Administration Transmission Deal and Democratic Support As Governor Gray Davis scrambles to build support for his SoCal Ed transmission proposal one thing is evident the longer the deal is exposed to public debate the less likely it is to pass In fact politicians have been so leery of the deal that Davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor to introduce the bill in the Senate In the eyes of many Democrati c legislators and all Republicans forcing SoCal Edison into bankruptcy is looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines that is wh y the Governors senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick up or down vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week The bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoi d debate however if there is an opening within the next two weeks and Davis feels he has enough support it will be pushed through Because the SoCal deal needs every piece in place as negotiated by Davis team the team wants no amendments allowed on the Assembly floor and a quick vote If thi s unlikely fast track strategy fails for Davis the prospects for the transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily keep in mind that th at it cannot even be resubmitted to the Assembly until it has been vetted by SoCal Edison attorneys According to sources the legislature is going to try to modify the Memorandum of Understanding between Gov Davis and SCE However the Senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to pass even a modified MOU Burton reportedly believes that at lea st Democrats will vote against it along with the Republicans The more that bill gets picked apart in public the uglier it looks and the more Democrat s will realize that they are all alone in supporting it Another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of SoCal and not the state Among other things the state is overpaying by about billion for the transmission lines Additionally the MOU Davis has with SoCal Ed nearly matches point for point the deal Davis condemned with PG E Asset Seizures Since before the PGE bankruptcy filing we have maintained that asset seizures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasing ly frustrated Democrats Davis legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law on eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across California to existing power contracts negotiated by whom Daviss calls profiteering power brokers Of course everyone in the Governors office understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal courts and would be a legal nightmare there are a few minor Constitutiona l legal and interstate commerce problems The main thing is that the seizing would continue Daviss main approach to this problem management by press conference and it would put the Governor and Democrats on the right side of the issue punishing the capitalist leeches According to one senior Democratic legislator there is movement within Democratic members of the state Assembly to demand that Davis agree to seize the power contracts in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase Of cours e taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking the power plants The appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would allegedly put California state officials in charge of where the power is sold and reduce markups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide spotmarket power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the pric e through the roof Price Caps One strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur depends powerfully on decisions made by the three Republican Governors from Colorado Alaska and Wyoming These three were the key players during the Portland Western Governors Conference last January and according to senio r White House officials it took the personal and prolonged intervention of President Bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous call for price caps from the governors If they had signed that price cap appeal the administration source said we would already have price caps So if they start to make it clear something has changed we will have to listen Sources indicate that if these Republican leaders begin to rethin k their opposition to price caps the Bush administration will be forced to reconsider price caps as a remedy for the West Cost Plus Caps Think of these as Republican price caps in that their fir st duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to provide power into the affected grid Just to give some idea of magnitudes in a cost plus deal current discussions would put a cap on power costs at something like per kilowatt hour That is a long way down from the August futures contract that is pricing in per kilowatt hour but a lo ng way above last Augusts kwhr price and a particularly long way above t he cost of generating this power which is something like kwh MarketPrice Exceptions The option allows the Bush administration to hav e political credit for imposing price caps As we write FERC is currently i n the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generating power in California Duke Dynegy AES Reliant and Williams The permit grants a further threeyear waiver that allows them to sell power into California in the existing whatever price the market will bear In other words FERC could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy at the market price perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market share and then power to control prices would revert back to FERC Technically in granting the extension of these permits FERC has to establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield mark et power that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding power at crucial times Of course FERC has just found on three different rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the subsequent price spikes But that would mean FERC would have to want to wie ld effective power over price capping in California and they have shown no desire on that front The escape clause for FERC simply to renew the waiver s is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than of an electricity market and none of these companies come close In other words the waivers option lets FERC escape if the Bush administration and FERC commissioners really want to escape Once again th at decision may be more in the hands of the three Republican Governors than anywhere else in the country But you can be certain that in the past few days Administration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabilities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plants Democrats Seize Opportunity to blame Bush Senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could come in as high as billion which would destroy state finances for a decade Add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear everyday about their own direct outofpocket electricity costs they paid billion for electricity in billion in and are expected to pa y billion this year ten times the rate two years ago Then of course they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredible numbers home in a very direct way and well who can blame the Democrats f or saying there is a simple solution but the White House wont allow it National level Democrats realize Californias power crisis is a prime opportunity to chastise the Bush administration and its freemarket advocat e FERC Chairman Hebert over their resistance to summer price caps As Californias leaders calculate this years taxpayer energy bill at potentially billion a rogues gallery of Democratic congressional leaders are currently meeting with Governor Davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across the eight western states of the power grid with a singular message the solution to all western voters electricity problems lies righ t in Washington DC at FERC headquarters controlled by Bush Administration appointees And as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its possible impact on control over the US Congress comes more into focus the solutions articulated by Californias Democrats who sense they have Republicans on the run in the West become less and less fr ee market focused The two strains of the Democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps

deal going through is a onetime quick vote if deal has t o go to hearings it will probably die If not transmission deal legislators will seize assets and seek price ca ps Asset seizure would target power contracts then power plants as a resul t the endless court battles will ensue but this gives Davis opportunity to continue to blame generators and marketers Bankruptcy for SoCal is still the most likely scenario with the QFs or SoCal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended Congressional democrats rally around Davis and seize opportunity to blame the Administration Transmission Deal and Democratic Support As Governor Gray Davis scrambles to build support for his SoCal Ed transmission proposal one thing is evident the longer the deal is exposed to public debate the less likely it is to pass In fact politicians have been so leery of the deal that Davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor to introduce the bill in the Senate In the eyes of many Democrati c legislators and all Republicans forcing SoCal Edison into bankruptcy is looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines that is wh y the Governors senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick up or down vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week The bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoi d debate however if there is an opening within the next two weeks and Davis feels he has enough support it will be pushed through Because the SoCal deal needs every piece in place as negotiated by Davis team the team wants no amendments allowed on the Assembly floor and a quick vote If thi s unlikely fast track strategy fails for Davis the prospects for the transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily keep in mind that th at it cannot even be resubmitted to the Assembly until it has been vetted by SoCal Edison attorneys According to sources the legislature is going to try to modify the Memorandum of Understanding between Gov Davis and SCE However the Senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to pass even a modified MOU Burton reportedly believes that at lea st Democrats will vote against it along with the Republicans The more that bill gets picked apart in public the uglier it looks and the more Democrat s will realize that they are all alone in supporting it Another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of SoCal and not the state Among other things the state is overpaying by about billion for the transmission lines Additionally the MOU Davis has with SoCal Ed nearly matches point for point the deal Davis condemned with PG E Asset Seizures Since before the PGE bankruptcy filing we have maintained that asset seizures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasing ly frustrated Democrats Davis legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law on eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across California to existing power contracts negotiated by whom Daviss calls profiteering power brokers Of course everyone in the Governors office understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal courts and would be a legal nightmare there are a few minor Constitutiona l legal and interstate commerce problems The main thing is that the seizing would continue Daviss main approach to this problem management by press conference and it would put the Governor and Democrats on the right side of the issue punishing the capitalist leeches According to one senior Democratic legislator there is movement within Democratic members of the state Assembly to demand that Davis agree to seize the power contracts in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase Of cours e taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking the power plants The appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would allegedly put California state officials in charge of where the power is sold and reduce markups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide spotmarket power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the pric e through the roof Price Caps One strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur depends powerfully on decisions made by the three Republican Governors from Colorado Alaska and Wyoming These three were the key players during the Portland Western Governors Conference last January and according to senio r White House officials it took the personal and prolonged intervention of President Bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous call for price caps from the governors If they had signed that price cap appeal the administration source said we would already have price caps So if they start to make it clear something has changed we will have to listen Sources indicate that if these Republican leaders begin to rethin k their opposition to price caps the Bush administration will be forced to reconsider price caps as a remedy for the West Cost Plus Caps Think of these as Republican price caps in that their fir st duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to provide power into the affected grid Just to give some idea of magnitudes in a cost plus deal current discussions would put a cap on power costs at something like per kilowatt hour That is a long way down from the August futures contract that is pricing in per kilowatt hour but a lo ng way above last Augusts kwhr price and a particularly long way above t he cost of generating this power which is something like kwh MarketPrice Exceptions The option allows the Bush administration to hav e political credit for imposing price caps As we write FERC is currently i n the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generating power in California Duke Dynegy AES Reliant and Williams The permit grants a further threeyear waiver that allows them to sell power into California in the existing whatever price the market will bear In other words FERC could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy at the market price perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market share and then power to control prices would revert back to FERC Technically in granting the extension of these permits FERC has to establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield mark et power that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding power at crucial times Of course FERC has just found on three different rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the subsequent price spikes But that would mean FERC would have to want to wie ld effective power over price capping in California and they have shown no desire on that front The escape clause for FERC simply to renew the waiver s is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than of an electricity market and none of these companies come close In other words the waivers option lets FERC escape if the Bush administration and FERC commissioners really want to escape Once again th at decision may be more in the hands of the three Republican Governors than anywhere else in the country But you can be certain that in the past few days Administration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabilities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plants Democrats Seize Opportunity to blame Bush Senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could come in as high as billion which would destroy state finances for a decade Add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear everyday about their own direct outofpocket electricity costs they paid billion for electricity in billion in and are expected to pa y billion this year ten times the rate two years ago Then of course they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredible numbers home in a very direct way and well who can blame the Democrats f or saying there is a simple solution but the White House wont allow it National level Democrats realize Californias power crisis is a prime opportunity to chastise the Bush administration and its freemarket advocat e FERC Chairman Hebert over their resistance to summer price caps As Californias leaders calculate this years taxpayer energy bill at potentially billion a rogues gallery of Democratic congressional leaders are currently meeting with Governor Davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across the eight western states of the power grid with a singular message the solution to all western voters electricity problems lies righ t in Washington DC at FERC headquarters controlled by Bush Administration appointees And as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its possible impact on control over the US Congress comes more into focus the solutions articulated by Californias Democrats who sense they have Republicans on the run in the West become less and less fr ee market focused The two strains of the Democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps

Executive Summary FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives Politically Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis from an economic perspective he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan most notably its exclusion of outofstate generators June st kill clause for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected billion power bill this summereconomic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement QF bid for advance payments from PGE likely to fail in bankruptcy court New generation delays probable because of StateQF squabbling Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal FERC Fallout The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action but is not Rather it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame Once they are politically inoculated the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions Moreover the Administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan Something Less than Effective Price Caps From Daviss point of view the FERC plan has four major flaws The order applies only to California not to the rest of the west NonCalifornia generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California As the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage emergency and does not require any collusion Even when the price caps kick in they are based on the costplus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap The generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control If Davis doesnt sign on to the regional grid by June st then he will have to live with June nd headlines blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California could therefore pay as much as billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of PGE and SCE These sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the FERC andor the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about days One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for longterm power deals The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture The countrys largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PGE Meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the QFs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted If the QFs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the mw of gasfired QF capacity will remain offline Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for longterm contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the MOU for the SCE bailout plan The analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points For example one of the elements of the MOU is a nonbypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid This is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity This makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds According to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company For this and other reasons even if the Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose LongTerm Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to disclose the details of the longterm power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis Even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay

is in a holding patter n until they can name a new Chair to head up the corporation Brian Smith was replaced with interim Chairman Robert Fairweather but we do not expect Fairweather to have a long tenure the word is Gordon Campbell and compan y are seeking a replacement to fill Mr Smiths shoes as early as midAugus t We expect key changes to occur in Hydros executive and board of direct ors following the appointment of the new Chair Although senior management at BC Hydro is relatively comfortable with the companys financial positio n and competitiveness they will be pursuing a strategy of expanding genera tion capability through new dams and oilgas exploration pending environme ntal approvals As a part of BC Hydros move to look for additional genera ting capacity they are turning to a pair of megaprojects that were scrapp ed a decade ago BC Hydro has commissioned new technical review studies of the MW Site C hydroelectric project near Fort St John and the MW coalfired Hat Creek project near Kamloops In terms of a rate hearing we do not expect BC Hydro to conduct a rate hea ring until the new Chairman is appointed It will be difficult to get rate s raised although with the government budget deficit looming there will be considerable pressure to begin looking this direction Another key revenu e challenge for BC Hydro will be responding to the recent price caps impose d by FERC on western power markets and potential power purchase refunds to California though their contributions are not immense they are still sign ificant BC Energy Politics Things have really heated up in Victoria now that the new Campbell administ ration is settling in Earlier we reported that the Office of the Premier had taken control of all the agencies and political staffing decisions W ith of the elected members of the BC Legislature sources close to th e Premier indicate change will be fast and furious to offset any local co verage from volatile media The BC Governments primary focus will be to s timulate the economy while trying to restrain government spending To that extent they have instituted an across the board stimulus tax cut and will have to deal with the deficit issues that that cut entails One of th e ways they are looking to balance things out is to outsource Crown assets and look for other areas to generate revenue new sources of government re venue through oil and gas exploration and energy will be a top priority Minister of Energy and Mines Richard Neufeld will be one of the main driv ers behind the current fasttracking of the offshore oil and natural gas ex ploration There is a great deal of pressure on the BC Liberals to balance this budget and they will be looking at ways of delivering revenue sources through oil and gas exploration permitting as a shortterm solution Neuf eld has reviewed the Backhouse Report Northern Development Commission reg arding the need for continued local public input and has basically tossed i t aside the report had not gone far enough to please the Liberals Other things on the Minister of Energys agenda Oppose Sumas power project phase out Burarrd Thermal Sumas has bee n a serious bone of contention between Washington State and Canada With Core Review protect BC Hydro and all of its core assets includin g dams reservoirs and power lines under public ownership Restore independent BC Utilities Commission

recommendations regarding allocation of funding that ha s been frozen for the Power for Jobs Initiative BPA Senator Patty Murray moved last week to drop the review provision on the Se nate bill which would have opened up an additional billion for BPA borr owing authority If Senator Murray is successful the measure could have a substantial impact on BPA financial solvency With the exception of the approximately million spill over the Dalles an d Bonneville dams BPA has already foregone a major summer spill to protect endangered salmon species Representatives of four Northwest governors ventured to Washington DC last week to express concerns over the new hydro BiOp and how it will be impleme nted States were concerned about their lack of input in the implementatio n process a plan being developed by action agencies and spearheaded by BP A The plan has been put on hold pending a review headed by Interior Depar tment lawyer Ann Klee Idaho and Washington representatives showed concern that the BiOp could be overturned in court they were concerned that the NMFS underestimated the risk of extinction of Snake River stocks and that i t was illegal to rely on offsite mitigation to help satisfy the hydro syst ems ESA obligations While the administration has said it plans to double past expenditures to implement the BiOp nobody at the meeting could come up with just what the previous BiOp costs were for now the salmon plan i s pure lip service Smelter Curtailments Kaiser Faced with declining aluminum prices which have decreased from last year Kaiser is in a difficult position due to the fact that they are maintaining a level of infrastructure and personnelreadiness which will al low them to restart s lines of their operations on the fly Should t his curtailment last longer than a year it would be costprohibitive for t hem to continue incurring that infrastructure expense Kaiser has gone on the record to say it is still open to signing load a curtailment agreement with BPA but it is unclear at this time whether BPA foresees a benefit in signing an agreement considering shortterm and perceived midterm electric ity price decreases We are continuing to monitor this situation as it dev elops although an agreement in the shortterm seems doubtful Alcoa Recently mentioned in the press Canadas Newfoundland government an d US aluminum giant Alcoa Inc announced Thursday they would conduct a fe asibility study to possibly revive the stalled Lower Churchill hydroelectri c project in the remote Labrador region The generating station on Gull Is land could produce up to MW of electricity Costs of the project are estimated at some C billion billion far below the C billion o riginally thought With a drop in net income due to slackening global aluminum demand and higher energy prices Alcoa has suffered along with the rest of the aluminum industry to find cheaper less volatile sources of el ectricity Along with their ongoing negotiations with BC Hydro it appears Alcoa is making a determined push to work with the Canadians to play all s ides of a competitive electricity market Forestry Issues There are a number of fuel management projects

please feel free to Kristin Walsh x EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FERC MultiParty Refund Negotiations BPA Financials Smelter Agreements BC Hydro Rate Freeze Power Refunds The big event that happened last week in Washington DC in regards to Calif ornia and the rest of the Western energy markets was that multiparty nego tiations that flopped apparently the difference between billion and million between parties could not be settled Below is a rough brea kdown corporate offerings Williams Duke Reliant Dynegy Mirant million combined PowerEx BC Hydro million Power Marketers including Enron million California Municipal Utilities million Loadserving entities outside CA million Northwest utilities submitted their calculations of overcharges however J udge Curtis Wagner has virtually ignored Northwest claims of million i n overcharges stating There was little time to address the issues raised by the Pacific Northwest parties They did not have data on what they are owed nor an amount of refunds due them Contrary to the judges claim a number of Northwest utilities did submit claim amounts at the settlement c onference although the problem is each utility has its own methodology for calculating these amounts Wagner was probably frustrated that there was no standard methodology for these calculations and appears to be leaning ag ainst giving NW utilities the same fasttrack status as California FERC h ad originally not even wanted to consider NW claims in this conference unti l a group of NW senators got together and applied some pressure the resul t was there was not much time to get the overcharge data together Below i s another rough breakdown of the claims PacificCorp million Snohomish PUD million Tacoma Power million Seattle City Light million Port of Seattle million BPA million BPA BPA Borrowing Sen Patty Murray DWA has been leading the fight for BPA s request of B in additional borrowing authority and was pleased the Sen ate voted to increase access to additional funds however Sen Murray has promised to fight the reauthorization caveat Murrays spokesman said the Committee may have been concerned about bumping up against spending caps when it added the mandate for annual reauthorization Bonneville has war ned it could exhaust its borrowing authority by the end of unless the amount was boosted from the current limit of billion the increase got through the Senate Energy Water Development Subcommittee but had the caveat added when it reached the full Appropriations Committee Increased borrowing authority would be used to update transmission infrastructure r etrofit Columbia River hydropower projects to boost efficiency and continue conservation programs We can expect to see more action coming out of Sen Murrays office Refunds Recent media reports have hinted to the possibility of Northwest utilities including BPA seeking refunds for the overpriced power Californ ia is currently fighting This information seems supported by fears that ea rlier settlements reached between Northwest utilities and California State may be challenged by bankruptcy proceedings If a bankruptcy court were to issue a ruling that significantly altered agreements between BPA and PGE potentially bankrupt SoCal Ed it is possible that BPA could press a refund request in the range of M to M However while BPAs refund request may be an option to stabilize their finances they are also careful about voicing their opinion because of the million in gross sales the y made from California BPA Administration The Bush Administration reportedly has no current plan s to replace the BPAs administrator The entire Northwest delegation Dem ocrats and Republicans from the BPA region has asked that he be made the f ulltime administrator However since many of the decisionmakers at DOE are conservative Republicans theyre not comfortable with him because he i s a Democrat At this time DOE people are unsure of how to handle this ma tter and appear to be in a state of limbo DSIAluminum Smelter Load Reduction Agreements BPA is in the hot seat r ight now realizing that falling electricity prices is making it possible f or smelters under load reduction agreements to begin shopping around for ot her sources Few believe that these current market prices will be sustaina ble considering the fact that the West will see a significant supply incre ase within the next year Consequently DSIs will be very concerned about signing long term price contracts given the current downward pressure on p rices which are still historically very high but dropping Currently t here are two Northwest smelters seeking to restart plant operations Alco a is in preliminary talks with BC Hydro to secure additional power to resta rt its Intalco smelter and Kaiser free from the money and the constraints of a loadreduction agreement is also attempting to restart plants We w ill continuing monitoring of this situation and will update as the story de velops BC HYDRO Rate Freeze The current rate freeze was imposed by the former NDP governm ent and it ends September It is up to the government to direct t he BCUC to lift the rate freeze and before it can do that it has to sched ule a rate hearing and decide to put the utility back under the BCUCs purv iew It has been a number of years since there was a rate hearing and peo ple are not looking forward to it because it begs all sorts of questions ab out overall energy policy A rate hearing will be delayed until the new go vernment has completed its administrative core review and decided on a br oader energy policy including its goals for BC Hydro Lifting the rate fr eeze partly depends on how much regulators believe should be held in the ra te stabilization account this money has been redirected elsewhere over th e past few years leaving the utility unprepared for the sort of lowwater conditions that have surfaced this year BC Hydro wants the freeze lifted and the new government will have an ideological bias against continuing th e rate freeze given that it was put in place by the NDP and flouts free ent erprise principles This suggests the rate freeze is on the way out but i t may persist beyond the original September deadline for the reasons out lined above How long it persists depends on how long it takes the new gove rnment to complete the core review

Angelides Hides State Budget Concerns House Committee to Vote on Energy Relief Edisons MOU Doubtful The unusually calm settling over the California legislature about SoCal Edi sons potential bankruptcy has finally affected the relentlessly optimistic investment bank analysts and other company shareholders We have reported that through all plans from BZ there is not a solid plan to save this co mpany and now executives are even more fearful that this predictions may co me to fruition Over the last few days Edison executives have begun pointing hard at the C PUC meeting this Friday as a makeorbreak event for the company The is b ecause after the meeting Daviss MOU plan to buy SoCals grid will have no chance of preventing a potential bankruptcy This plan is essentially dea d although Governor Daivs has yet to say this in a press releases The fin al nail will happen after the CPUC adjourns its Friday meeting without voti ng on several necessary MOU provisions Unless the CPUC makes a last minut e emergency amendment to their agenda the deal will be dead despite S oCals support for letting the deal stand past its deadline Sources indi cate that CPUC President Loretta Lynch holds reservations on the MOU and co ntinues to distance herself from Davis Attempting to influence policy making Edison executives have spent the las t few investor phone conferences warning that June would see substantiall y increased risks for a creditorinduced bankruptcy if the Davis plan dies at CPUC This is interesting since no one else seems to have been focused on the date until Edison began mentioning it late last week However the re is no more or less threat of bankruptcy than there is now or will be in two weeks As reported several times earlier most everyone had given up on the MOU long before this Fridays CPUC meeting Plan Z Shows Little Progress Meanwhile the unhurried pace toward a Plan Z that we reported last Friday has gained little progress Legislators continue to pinpoint a plan that will secure reelection votes and at the same time weigh the need for rat e hikes for Californias corporate and home electricity users As they has h it out the state is spending even more on electricity purchases In spi te of better than expected levels of conservation the states electricity expenditures over the last month rose to an average of Mday The recent rate increases mean more spending by the state and that calls into questio n the reassuring Angelides scenario for Californias budget prospects later this year The California Budget Crunch Even more worrisome than a idle Plan Z is increasing evidence that last mon ths conference call with State Treasurer Angelides was a little misleading During that conference call Angelides claimed that State Comptroller Conn ell and many in the financial committee had the numbers wrong Angelides a rgued that B already spent to buy power since January was really the to tal amount of authorized spending through late August In fact he said on ly B of that had been spent Sources now indicate that Angelides wa s technically correct if you use spent to mean only the amount of money f or which checks had been written This is different than the amount of mon ey California had already promised to energy suppliers who had already supp lied energy to the state In fact when Angelides was speaking the state h ad in fact already promised to pay B for energy it had already consumed the total committed has topped B By the time the state gets its power bonds auctioned in August they will have already spent all B and be b ack to dipping into the General Fund The idea of RANs being auctioned be fore the power bonds get issued is still an option if the general fund does nt make it to August The nearest answer to both of these cash flow deficits lies in part in the painful process that the legislature is undertaking now another round of huge electricity rate hikes to securitize debt issuance Then the hope is that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings wh olesale rates down and the debts can be repaid The only near term path t o bringing generating assets on line immediately is the MW from QF pl ants which are off line because of cash flow problems Settling their need s is wrapped up in settling the PGE and Edison trade creditor issues whic h makes the legislatures leisurely approach to the rate hikehaircut situa tion all the more troublesome Energy Relief The House Energy Commerce Committee is scheduled to vote on HR th e Emergency Electricity Relief Act tomorrow at am The bill which w as twice postponed and does not include any provisions on price caps but d uring the course of the markup sources indicate that it is possible even likely that a Democrat could offer a price cap amendment Rep Waxman D CA offered a price cap amendment at an earlier markup of the bill at the subcommittee level The Waxman amendment was rejected along party lines all Republicans and Democrats voted nay Sources inside Joe Bartons of fice report that staff and members have been meeting to work out a compromi se on the price cap issue but nothing has been resolved As of this aftern

Party currently holding polls at a probusiness rightofcenter party led by Gordon Campbell Major changes in British Columbia energy policy are likely under a Libe ral government A low snow pack a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed by US power consumers could force BC Hydro to stop outofprovince power sales once existing contracts expire BC Hydros additional generation at Williston is likely undeliverable Liberal Party Platform Income tax cut that would make BCs income tax the lowest in Canada Independent audit of the provinces books amid allegations of NDP misma nagement and incompetence Review of all Crown corporations including BC Hydro to enhance effici ency and management quality Campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the Corporate Capital Tax the Machinery Equipment Tax and the Corporate Income Tax Energy Agenda According to sources under the Liberal partys rule significant changes i n the BC governments energy policy could include a move toward the privati zation of some BC Hydro assets perhaps including its transmission assets as well as increased government support for independent power producers and coalfired production At the same time a rate review and attempts to es tablish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack of clarity about the provinces overall energy strategy over the next few y ears Campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding coalfired production Campbell calls thermal coal an asset that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in BC A hig hranking NDP source believes that Campbell will take the province back alo ng the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting new techn ology The source expects this to lead to strong protests from environment alists These are confrontational moves and people will be on the street s Campbells most likely choice for energy minister is Richard Neufeldt thou gh we caution that this decision depends on the makeup of the legislature after the election Neufeldt is responsible for the Liberal Partys energy mining and northern development portfolio Sources speculate that if rig htwing Liberals are dissatisfied with the partys performance after the Ma y election Neufeldt could again defect to the Opposition However this g ives Campbell even greater incentive to name Neufeldt energy minister a hi ghprofile position Should the Liberals win the election Gordon Campbell has indicated that he would return BC Hydro to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission The B C government has derived billion in revenue from BC Hydro since roughly percent of its profit Critics say this has undermined the uti litys ability to pay down approximately billion in debt and invest in the future This also has left Hydro without a rate stabilization fund so mething that sources feel may be needed this year Campbell reportedly int ends to address these issues and one can expect this to lead to calls for change Electricity Export Policy Currently the BC Utilities Commission is demanding more information about B C Hydros outofprovince sales The Commission has warned that given the low snow pack the utility could be a net importer of power this year Sup porting this view the Northwest Power Planning Council representing BC Hy dros key trading partners in the US has said that it would not be able to rely upon British Columbia or Alberta during peak consumption periods over the next few years and that its customers face a percent chance of not making it through the winter without power losses The combination of a l ow snow pack a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission and pub lic concern about outstanding debts owed to BC Hydro by US consumers may fo rce BC Hydro to stop outofprovince power sales once existing contracts ex pire BC Hydro Privatization A key campaign energy issue for the Liberal party is the privatization of B C Hydro Campbell has urged greater electricity competition saying We n eed to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all producer s and consumers on an equal and nondiscriminatory basis He stated that independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn I want to change that big time he told the Canadian Institute of Energy Campbell also urged more natural gas development including pipelines and cogenera tion plants Campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by NDP leader Ujjal Dosanjh Campbell stated on April We have no intention of selling BC Hydro we have no intentions of selling their transmission li nes no intention of selling their dams we have no intention of selling th eir reservoirs Liberal Party spokesman Mike Morton also reiterated on April that BC Hydro would not be for sale A highlevel NDP source commen ted that Campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regardi ng BC Hydro essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams trans mission lines or generating stations but that he is in favor of opening th e sector up to competition However local sources believe that some parts of BC Hydro might be sold as part of an overall review of BC Crown Corporations to enhance efficiency Likely sale prospects include BC Hydros distribution channels and its ene rgy trading subsidiary Powerex In addition Gary FarrellCollins the Li beral finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister after Neufeldt has stated that public ownership of BC Hydros noncore bu sinesses such as Westech its systems division and customer billing coul d come under review BC Hydro Williston Generation Current reservoirs levels at BC Hydros Williston hydrogeneration facility are at ft which allows BC Hydro to drop levels another ft Gw hsft under their current permit The one drawback to this plans additio nal generation involves the Mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease op eration if water levels were to fall below ft Sources close to the M inister of Mines Energy elect Richard Neufeldt indicate that levels a t Williston probably will not be drawn down below Mackenzies operational l imits due to concern over political backlash

Not Meet Their May th Deadline Due to Lack of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuancebridge loan by the May th deadline Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart According to sources both the Republic ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis The Democratic cauc us is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis Many legislative Republic ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that o nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund Davis would double dip into the fund Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg islature and the governor However it is believed once Davis discloses th e details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take plac e Additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the lon gterm power contracts as opposed to those still in development require t hat the bond issuance happen by July If not the state may be in breach of contract Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th e bridge loan legislation by May th having a bond issuance by July st wi ll be very difficult The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat e would eat the billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately billion However the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful l disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan AB X and AB X AB X authorizes the DWR to sell up to billion in bonds This bi ll passed the Senate in March but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac k of Republican support AB X deals with energy conservation programs fo r community college districts However sources report this bill may be am ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen curre ntly in AB X Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be li kely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature Republic ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund For instance Tony Strickland has stated that only of the bonds or approximately billion should be issued Other Republ icans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday Additionally Lehman Brothers repo rtedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind ications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount B LendersJP Morgan B Lehman Brothers B Bear Stearns M Tax Exempt PortionOf the B B is expected to be taxexempt Projected Interest RateTaxable Rate TaxExempt Rate Current Projected Blended IR Maturity DateAugust For more details please contact me at Bill SB X Passed the Senate Yesterday but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB X yesterday which authorizes billion to create t he California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority The billion authorized under SB X is not the same as the billion that must be aut horized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the addi tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward Again the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz ations Without the details of the longterm power contracts the governor has negotiated the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support No f urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchas ing power Also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the Calif ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority However this can be consi dered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earl ier in the crisis SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy T he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au gust th however some decision will likely be made earlier According t o sources the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal though SoCal has s igned it The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass If the legislature indicat es that it will not pas the MOU SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank ruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash The second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond is suance would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB X bridge loan s tating that the DWR would received of its payments from ratepayers th en the utilities would receive the residual amount In other words the st ate will get paid before the utilities If this language is included and p assed by the legislature it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments

discretion Executive Summary FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives Politically Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis from an economic perspective he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan most notably its exclusion of outofstate generators June st kill clause for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected billion power bill this summereconomic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement QF bid for advance payments from PGE likely to fail in bankruptcy court New generation delays probable because of StateQF squabbling Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal FERC Fallout The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action but is not Rather it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame Once they are politically inoculated the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions Moreover the Administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan Something Less than Effective Price Caps From Daviss point of view the FERC plan has four major flaws The order applies only to California not to the rest of the west NonCalifornia generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California As the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage emergency and does not require any collusion Even when the price caps kick in they are based on the costplus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap The generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control If Davis doesnt sign on to the regional grid by June st then he will have to live with June nd headlines blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California could therefore pay as much as billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of PGE and SCE These sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the FERC andor the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about days One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for longterm power deals The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture The countrys largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PGE Meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the QFs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted If the QFs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the mw of gasfired QF capacity will remain offline Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for longterm contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the MOU for the SCE bailout plan The analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points For example one of the elements of the MOU is a nonbypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid This is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity This makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds According to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company For this and other reasons even if the Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose LongTerm Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to disclose the details of the longterm power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis Even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay

chance of deal going through is a onetime quick vote if deal has to go to hearings it will probably die If not transmission deal legislators will seize assets and seek price caps Asset seizure would target power contracts then power plants as a res ult the endless court battles will ensue but this gives Davis opportunity to continue to blame generators and marketers Bankruptcy for SoCal is still the most likely scenario with the QFs or SoCal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended Congressional democrats rally around Davis and seize opportunity to bla me the Administration Transmission Deal and Democratic Support As Governor Gray Davis scrambles to build support for his SoCal Ed transmi ssion proposal one thing is evident the longer the deal is exposed to pub lic debate the less likely it is to pass In fact politicians have been so leery of the deal that Davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor to introduce the bill in the Senate In the eyes of many Democratic legisl ators and all Republicans forcing SoCal Edison into bankruptcy is looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines that is why the G overnors senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick up or down vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week The bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoid debat e however if there is an opening within the next two weeks and Davis feel s he has enough support it will be pushed through Because the SoCal deal needs every piece in place as negotiated by Davis team the team wants no amendments allowed on the Assembly floor and a quick vote If this unli kely fast track strategy fails for Davis the prospects for the transmissio n lines purchase will deteriorate steadily keep in mind that that it canno t even be resubmitted to the Assembly until it has been vetted by SoCal Edi son attorneys According to sources the legislature is going to try to m odify the Memorandum of Understanding between Gov Davis and SCE However the Senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to pass even a modified MOU Burton reportedly believes that at least Democ rats will vote against it along with the Republicans The more that bill g ets picked apart in public the uglier it looks and the more Democrats will realize that they are all alone in supporting it Another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of SoCal and not the state Among other things the state is overpaying by about billion for the transmission lines Additionally the MOU Davis has wit h SoCal Ed nearly matches point for point the deal Davis condemned with PGE Asset Seizures Since before the PGE bankruptcy filing we have maintained that asset seiz ures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasingly f rustrated Democrats Davis legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law o n eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across California to existing power contracts negotiated by whom Daviss calls profiteering power brokers Of course everyone in the Governors office understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal courts and would be a legal nightmare there are a few minor Constitution al legal and interstate commerce problems The main thing is that the sei zing would continue Daviss main approach to this problem management by press conference and it would put the Governor and Democrats on the righ t side of the issue punishing the capitalist leeches According to one senior Democratic legislator there is movement within Democratic members o f the state Assembly to demand that Davis agree to seize the power contract s in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase Of course taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking t he power plants The appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would alle gedly put California state officials in charge of where the power is sold a nd reduce markups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide spotmarket power purchases before peak emergency conditions dri ve the price through the roof Price Caps One strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur dep ends powerfully on decisions made by the three Republican Governors from Co lorado Alaska and Wyoming These three were the key players during the Por tland Western Governors Conference last January and according to senior W hite House officials it took the personal and prolonged intervention of Pr esident Bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous c all for price caps from the governors If they had signed that price cap a ppeal the administration source said we would already have price caps So if they start to make it clear something has changed we will have to li sten Sources indicate that if these Republican leaders begin to rethink their opposition to price caps the Bush administration will be forced to r econsider price caps as a remedy for the West Cost Plus Caps Think of these as Republican price caps in that their fir st duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to provide power into the affected grid Just to give some idea of magnitudes in a cost plus deal current discussions would put a cap on power costs at something like per kilowatt hour That is a long way down from the Au gust futures contract that is pricing in per kilowatt hour but a long way above last Augusts kwhr price and a particularly long way above the cost of generating this power which is something like kwh MarketPrice Exceptions The option allows the Bush administration to hav e political credit for imposing price caps As we write FERC is currently in the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generatin g power in California Duke Dynegy AES Reliant and Williams The permi t grants a further threeyear waiver that allows them to sell power into Ca lifornia in the existing whatever price the market will bear In other w ords FERC could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy at the market price perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market share and then power to control prices would revert back to FERC Technically in granting the extension of these permits FERC has to establ ish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield market pow er that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding pow er at crucial times Of course FERC has just found on three different ruli ngs in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of a bility over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the s ubsequent price spikes But that would mean FERC would have to want to wiel d effective power over price capping in California and they have shown no d esire on that front The escape clause for FERC simply to renew the waivers is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than of an electricity market and none of these companie s come close In other words the waivers option lets FERC escape if the Bush administrat ion and FERC commissioners really want to escape Once again that decision may be more in the hands of the three Republican Governors than anywhere e lse in the country But you can be certain that in the past few days Admini stration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabi lities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plant s Democrats Seize Opportunity to blame Bush Senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could come in as high as billion which would destroy state finances for a d ecade Add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear every day about their own direct outofpocket electricity costs they paid bi llion for electricity in billion in and are expected to pay billion this year ten times the rate two years ago Then of course they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredibl e numbers home in a very direct way and well who can blame the Democrats for saying there is a simple solution but the White House wont allow it National level Democrats realize Californias power crisis is a prime oppor tunity to chastise the Bush administration and its freemarket advocate FE RC Chairman Hebert over their resistance to summer price caps As Califor nias leaders calculate this years taxpayer energy bill at potentially billion a rogues gallery of Democratic congressional leaders are current ly meeting with Governor Davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across t he eight western states of the power grid with a singular message the sol ution to all western voters electricity problems lies right in Washington D C at FERC headquarters controlled by Bush Administration appointees And as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its possible impact on control over the US Congress comes more into focus the solutions articulated by Californias Democrats who sense they have Republ icans on the run in the West become less and less free market focused T he two strains of the Democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps

Angelides Summary Bond Issuance to be B with year term tax exempt and n onexempt Angelides in favor of wind fall profit tax Opposed to current discussion between Davis and Socal in regards to Soc al paying off the generators over years with a year grace period What decisions on rate components are necessary before you can sell bonds The big things we need are that the PUC must enter into agreement with DWR essentially warranting that sufficient revenues from rates will be availa ble for purchasing power It is really their job to define what each party needs to pay for power We need to give assurance to the investment communi ty that whatever the overall rate is the state will get enough to pay its bonds However if the utilities challenge the decision it could stall the bond issuance What do you think will be the size of the first bond issue Based on what is currently possible and what the legislature has authorize d around bn The PUC has allowed us to sell north of bn but we ant icipate that bn is absorbable Until the administration provides details for this office and the public on what its costs of buying power are and w hat it needs in terms of funding what will drive it is that number not wh at the PUC has said The issuance may well be a single bn issue or a ser ies of smaller ones done together eg bn each weeks apart What is the total size of the market for CA taxexempt bonds What we do normally is bn in bonds for various revenues or general ob ligations In the CA infrastructure rate reductions bonds was a bn i ssuance and this was handled well This is not exclusively a CA market Around bn of these bonds is sold each year We anticipate that the bo nds will be taxexempt and nonexempt What is the total of electric supply contracts that are firm enough to requ ire funding We have estimates The DWR is buying power and lets say power costs and its portion of rates is This bond issuance covers the diff betwee n and So the bond issuance is a way to cover the gap However i f power prices do not come down you cannot keep borrowing If we issue mo re than bn in bonds I have to see the whole financial plan The impli cation is that he will not keep this plan secret What will be the term mix of the bond issues Overall term is expected to be in the year range I do not know the mix Do you have the ability to do bridging tax anticipation notes or anything l ike that to take care of the general fund The very purpose of the bridge loan is that we are taking a taxable and ta xexempt bridge loan until bonds are issued In order for us to issue bond s a number of steps have to occur I would hope that the PUC and DWR do wh at they have to do realistically by June Then the bond issuance would com e semi allatonce In other words either all at once or something like billion every three weeks Are all of the general funds assets in cash or are some in the form of a less liquid receivable We have a lot of liquidity in real cash in general fund We have a cash f low We have the ability in pooled money investment accounts so that we can go out to five years We have bnplus in that account What is the minimum working capital required in the general fund for dayto day operations It depends and goes up and down On any given day we are doing on the or der of mm There is a bn budget between the general funds and speci al fund Are you discussing the DWR contracting in relation to the required funding Do you have a veto on the deals struck This is all in the administrations court What we have asked for is the information We have asked for this today by letter We have to move from working with or banks to a public offering which means public disclos ure The general fund has been making advances to buy power but we want t o get out of that business and to stop the bn plus drain on general fund from arranging an interim loan What is the credit risk from industry or other large users cherry picking o r selfselecting There are limits on the options out there ABX has limited the ability o f people to opt out of the system If you do allow them to opt out what d o they have to pay to preserve the revenue stream The agreement between th e DWR and the PUC will say that through a financing order we will get you the revenue to service the bonds even if it adjusts rates This will be a covenant that the money will be made available If an initiative is launched could it create enough uncertainty to have an effect on ABIX or the bond issuance What about Harvey proofing What is the direct state participation The states role is infrastructure and economic development Bonds will b e issued in name of DWR only to pay for power the state is buying not to r epay utility deb I dont think the state will repay utility debt The st ate can buy power in or out of Chapter There will be no participation by the state bank I know Harvey well and he and I agree on a number of t hings For example I am cosponsoring the public power authority We shoul d not put the state in the business of refinancing utility debt I dont t hink most consumer groups realize that we are selling bonds to pay for powe r I very much want and it is in my interest to repay the general fund At the same time that this office is financing the purchase of energy the fundamental problem is the price we are being charged by the generatorsth e ransom that is being demanded by the generators I agree with Harvey that as of this current time the generators are winning We will have to consi der excess profits taxes or if the generators continue they have increase d their prices tenfold The generators they bought a set of plants for bn Since January the state has spent over bn If the generators dont take their foot off our throat they may leave us no option but to take ba ck plants under emergency power So let them justify those rates What c auses the problem is the generators jacking up prices to the point where th ey will make us do something about it What is the measurable size premium that will have to be paid based on th e most current estimates of bond issue size Measurable is the wrong choice of words We dont know how many basis poi nts If it is more than bn we will begin to feel it Also I am not for that proposal to allow the utilities to pay off the gene rators over years with a year grace period They should work that out themselves not on the backs of ratepayers The perspective here is that t hey did very very well in and They upstreamed billions

inevitable Many questions still unanswered most notably sizestructure of rate increase and past utility debts Past undercollect major sticking point with little help available from transmission deal or longterm contracts Reliant seeking relief in circuit court from emergency orders large generators increasingly angry with Davis blame game QFs waiting for details of rate hike new price formula crucial to SoCals ability to make payments Bankruptcy outlook increasingly complex but debt rescheduling remains subject to failure In our late Friday report we wrote Davis could order rate hikes as a last ditch effort but this action would not address the undercollection issue There is still a high chance of bankruptcy by either the larger generators commercial paper holders and less now but still very possible the QFs as time is running out Events are unfolding exactly along these lines Why Rate Hikes Now CPUC President Lorretta Lynch came out this weekend in favor of rate hikes Davis and many legislators recognize that rate hikes are the quickest solution but that there is a potentially painful political price attached Davis will probably come out in support of a structured rate system passing on most of the hikes to business and industrial users Other California politicians are starting to face reality of rate hikes The CalEnergy ruling massively reduced their leverage over the creditors who are now able to sell outside the state if they can get similar relief from the courts And its not just the QFsthe giant Reliant Energy is appealing to the Ninth Circuit Court in San Francisco against Federal Judge Frank Damrells series of rulings forcing large generators to continue to sell to California What Impact Will the Rate Hikes Have Rate rises will stabilize the situation going forward but there will be a messy scramble to assign blame and liability for past debts Some form of rescheduling is a possibility but there are any number of accidents that could happen and yet result in bankruptcy for the utilities if they dont seek protection from creditors themselves UndercollectionNet Short Still Unaddressed All of these developments fail to address the past undercollection or the bond revenue plan Still the passage of rate hikes could speed up the legislature on these fronts as well The bulk of the rate hikes will go first to repay the DWR then to the commercial creditors Absent the transmission line deal the bond revenue plan would have to be restructured to repay the past undercollect Longterm power contracts are still relatively meaningless until when the majority of the contracts kick in Large Power Suppliers Losing Patience Relations are also deteriorating between Davis and the large power suppliers Davis for the most part has been very careful to cultivate them during the drawn out negotiations talking to several of the main CEOs almost daily But state legislators and officials are rapidly trying to initiate investigations of alleged market manipulation and overcharging to deflect the growing political heat from themselves This is only agitating the larger generators more as every day passes If Reliant loses their case it may also tempt some of the larger generators to force the issue to bankruptcy Whats more financial creditors are also waiting with growing impatience and the utilities themselves are contemplating voluntary bankruptcy PGE in particular simply will not agree to Davis transmission lines deal as it stands and a bankruptcy workout may offer the best albeit uncertain chance of a return to eventual health someday QFs Listening and Waiting But the largest threat as we have been saying is not from the major energy companies It is the small companies known as QFs that will be the triggers if bankruptcy occurs Remember these two facts The QFs are a diverse group of companies and it only takes three of them to force bankruptcy and many of them have to move in court quickly or lose any possible standing for future court action It is in the interests of a number of creditors to wait and hope that a negotiated settlement can be reached but others have a large incentive to game the situation and threaten to force bankruptcy Other bullish news PGE gets extended forbearance until April th from its banks and SoCal announces that it will pay some QFs The actual amount of payments to the QFs is still subject to the CPUC approving a revised pricing formula that is satisfactory to the QFs That decision should come tomorrow Outlook Last week we wrote that the QFs felt there was no point in filing today because they want to see what they can get from the legislature this week and in all likelihood what they can get from the CPUC hearing next week The next hours will be crucial Only massive rate hikes or higher roughly would address the undercollect issue and Davis is unlikely to authorize those As one source told us the age of denial is mostly coming to an end and that is the main source of hope that California can begin to move forward from this But the situation is so complex and there are so many players and angles involved that a negotiated solution to the past debt problem will still be complicated and vulnerable to failure

An exemption of the gasfired QFs from this bill as proposed by Sen Keeley could further forestall an involuntary bankruptcy filing If passed the draft CPUC order would give the utilities another days after rate hikes to pay the QFs The negotiations with the QFs are complicated by the issue of payments owed by the utilities to the DWR Senators are demanding that the utilities set up a trust fund from rate revenues to pay back the DWR The CalEnergy ruling as reported by Bloomberg this PM is an attractive option for other QFs looking to at least temporarily escape longterm supply contracts with Edison If neither the CPUC nor the legislature exempts the gasfired generators from the new rate structure an immediate involuntary bankruptcy filing is expected However if the exemption is implemented then a bankruptcy filing would be delayed QF Bill Makes it to Senate Floor The CPUC bill the number is not yet known is in mockup form and does the following Repeals PUC Code section which set a formula for QFs under deregulation Amends portions of AB X which will ensure that DWR receives money for its power purchases and includes provisions for the issuance of bonds Includes a provision for SDGE rates since they were not covered under other legislation The bill passed the Senate Energy and also just passed the Senate Appropriations Committee and is headed to the Senate Floor Senator Comments on the Bill Keeley author of bill presented that the bill would allow the PUC to decide the QF contracts which is the proper authority to debate the issue Most of the opposition to this portion of the bill was regarding the fact that the bill provides no guidance to the PUC regarding voided costs for natural gasfired QFs Republicans offered an amendment to not have section repealed for gasfired generators but Keeley had concerns with the amendment Keeley stated that he did not think they should limit the PUCs flexibility and that as drafted the amendment was too broad He also indicated that gasfired utilities have a legitimate issue with the draft order He said that the PUC order needs to be amended and Keeley is confident that the PUC has recognized that in discussion over the past hours Opponents to the QF Bill The following people testified in opposition to QF portion TURN Delta Power QF Syke Energy John Hancock Financial California Manufacturers Association Crockett Cogeneration Independent Energy Producers Clean Power Campaign PGE SCE The gasfired QFs that testified in opposition noted that they have been offline for a couple of months and cannot come back online unless their issues are addressed In response to the QFs not getting paid Sen Bowen stated that if the utilities do not pay the QFs as directed under the draft order then she would personally see to it that they go into bankruptcy PGE and SCE Testimony Sen Battin asked both utilities about the draft order which states that after the change in the rates by QFs the utilities must pay the QFs within days and whether the utilities would abide by the order PGEs response was that they are receiving million per month the cost of their own generation is million and the QF amount is million per month the draft order would lower the QF cost to million PGE was cut off at this point and asked point blank whether their answer to Battins question was yes or no Battin Bowen and Murray all asked whether it was yes or no The PGE rep stated that it would be no if the issue of the payments owed to ISO and DWR is not resolved If the ISO costs of purchases were included in the DWR payments then PGE would not have a problem The SCE response was that if the money coming in was less than the money going out then it could not comply with the PUC order Payments to DWR Senator Sher then asked both utilities regarding a requirement under AB X that the utilities set aside those moneys that are owed to the DWR for purchasing power that they collect from ratepayers in a trust fund those SCE responded that they are still in negotiations with DWR on the terms and conditions Several legislators responded angrily that this was not part of the bill and that they should have a trust fund set up PGE noted that they are setting some money aside but would not state how much Sen Sher ended the conversation by stating that if the utilities do not set up a trust fund by tomorrow they would either pass emergency legislation or go after them for violating the law X Provisions Tim Gage from Dept of Finance noted the Governors support of the entire bill and noted that the X provisions would ensure that DWR gets paid PGE also testified in opposition to these provisions Senator Bowen made the following statements Senator Peace has announced that he has received another notice of million appropriation needed to purchase power and will not approve the funding unless PGE and SCE drop their challenge to the PUC regarding the DWR issue Also stated that the PUC could

increase due to a one day optout clause in all longterm power contracts PGE and State locked in tough negotiations several issues on the table PUCimposed requirement forcing PGE to ultimately be responsible for California energy supplies Price of the grid state times book value vs PGE times book value PGE will not use any of the B secured last week to help their ailing utility Daviss announcement of long term power contract didnt include some details Of the megawatts secured this far only are available this summer Some of the long term contracts are really only for three months None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot market One the same day Davis announced long term contracts Davis also quietly announce a rate hike FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal PGE Transmissions deal One thing that is still uncertain is PGE Bankruptcy may still be a likely alternative if current negotiations to buy PGEs share of the electric transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April when all longterm power contracts being negotiated have a oneday optout clause they can exercise unilaterally if a comprehensive solution has not been reached by the state and its major utilities According to sources close to senior PGE officials PGE made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal on the transmission lines depends on the California governments willingness to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make until now PGE will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to relieve it of the PUCimposed requirement to be the electricity buyer of last resort Current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all times to supply Californias energy needs As long as the state steps in and makes those purchases as it has for the past three months the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings But PGE officials are worried this summers supply and Daviss concern over how fast he is draining the states budget surplus If things get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity it buys through longterm contracts then PGE will be left holding the bag Thus as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid PGE is demanding a comprehensive solution that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed to pay State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of get out of jail free card so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough negotiations that are complicated by three other factors PGEs public behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy State legislative demands that the price Davis negotiate for PGEs part of the electricity grid be no more than times revenues from the grid and the FERC must positively approve any grid purchase by the state of California The principal concern on the price front is that PGE wants to sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their transmission while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the politically acceptable limit We see times book value as an absolute upper bound There is no way PGE will get more than that whatever they think according to the leader of one main consumer groups We are going to try to force any deals down to about in any case Negotiators for Davis are also trying to propositionproof any transmission deal to protect against a later ballot proposal They think there are ways to do that but not if the price of PGEs part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative Remember if Daviss eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative he will be running for reelection on the same ballot as a public initiative designed to overturn his solution On the Sacramento front no one understands PGEs motives The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game PGE is playing In a three day period PGE made a series of announcements that left everyone scratching their heads Late Thursday PGE officials leaked information to California papers that they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity transmission grid to the state which seemed like obvious good news but then made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least above what the state was currently offering While a deal can still be done anything like the billion PGE wants would be very hard to get through the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase Late Friday PGE officials announced that they had secured a billion loan for the parent company not the electricity utility and would use the money to pay off bondholders other creditors and to return million to shareholders in a new dividend payout Not a cent of that money was earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PGE and that left at least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood Over the weekend PGE leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay off its energy suppliers debt for cents on the dollar right now For generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will make them whole in a couple of months that kind of trial balloon is extremely unnerving Thus in a very short time period PGEs corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at least a part of the billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and PGEs fundraising will harden and deepen those demands As one senior political official told our source just when you think the corporate leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible they come up with something even more outrageous PGEs actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to construct to solve Californias problems State Democrats doubt they will get Republican support for a deal which means a vote will fall short of the twothirds majority necessary for immediate enactment resulting in days for the legislation to go into effect Additionally in the past hours many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the electricity grid Longterm Contracts Davis didnt tell the whole truth Yesterday Davis announced that he had signed longterm power deals for megawatts of power out of a total megawatts he wanted to sign eventually According to the press release Davis is now of the way toward his longterm goal and has already solved the hardest part of Californias energy crisis This means consumers would maybe pay more than necessary five years from now but these contracts guaranteed that consumers would pay less for the next three years What Davis failed to highlight was that of the megawatt commitment actually only megawatts are available this summer when demand is expected to megawatts and some of these longterm contracts are actually only good for three months None of these contracts however keep California from having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year While the media was concern with Daviss announcement of long term contracts for California of less concern to the media was Daviss quietly announced a decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers The state will accept the emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a permanent increase as well as an additional increase for consumers that will take effect early when the old rate cut legislation expires That would bring the average charge to about cents a kilowatt hour FERC The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve it in a positive vote Senior California officials and legislators doubt that FERC has jurisdiction and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal But they may be wrong The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs off on the deal Its power over transmission deal is absolute no matter what anyone says according to source close to the President There are three possibilities FERC could pocket veto it by not even putting it on agenda for discussion the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted down The Democrat on the commission William Massey has already said he is opposed to it or the Commission could approve it but with condition that Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system One complicating factor in the FERC decision however is that its chairman Curt Hebert who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale may not be around long enough to have his say Hebert is definitely not a shoo in for the FERC chairman position says one Washington official Two other appointments to the Commission will soon be named this official notes and one of them could easily become chairman

are on and the snowpack is approaching nor mal levels after a month of torrential storms back at the poker table in S acramento the situation continues to drift toward bankruptcy Indeed almos t any reading of Governor Gray Daviss political situation after the shock LA Federal Court ruling makes forcing the utilities into bankruptcy his bes t bet At least one of the three major power generators PGE seems to agr ee that bankruptcy is better than cutting the deal on the table now partic ularly after yesterdays FERC ruling that it is okay for the company to shi ft assets around to protect them in case of bankruptcy Davis Wants To Keep Hope Alive Until Analyst Meetings Next Week Today is crucial in determining the exact odds of a bankruptcy since Davis wants to cut a deal if possible before heading off to lead the National Gov ernors Association and meet with Wall Street analysts Tuesday and Wednesda y In fact Daviss desire to have something definitive to say next week is the only reason to believe that bankruptcy can be avoided in California A ccording to talks with all sides Davis has offered to buy the electricity grid from the three largest power producers PGE SoCal Edison and San Die go for something like billion that they could use to pay off most of th e money they owe to suppliers and creditors outside their own corporate she lls But the questions is why the utilities would want the deal that appears to be on offer and that leaves many people on both sides of the table wonderin g whether Davis actually wants a deal or an excuse to get back to a situati on where he has courtordered cover to raise electricity rates that he know s are necessary but politically difficult According to key Sacramento off icials Confidence continues to wane in Davis ability to do this The pla in fact is the stick hes carrying isnt awfully big Adds another The k ey people here just think the utilities are playing him Either theyre pla ying him or hes going to roll on the price hes going to pay double what the transmission assets are worth The utilities got away with the same ki nd of thing before in of course Davis is more astute than that and a bankruptcy judge could yet be the political cover for a resolution that has been lacking since the utilities lost their court case in Los Angeles Little Support for Transmission Assets Deal The transmission assets deal doesnt look attractive for anyone Davis has no particular affinity for it having adopted State Senator Burto ns proposal when his own preferred equity warrants idea began to fade The legislature is wary of more state involvement in the power industry an d concerned about the vast investment needed in the network The utilities PGE in particular dont want to sell Accounting Ambiguities Appear State Offers Only Tepid Support for Bon d Scheme There are also more and more issues quietly emerging about utility account ing methods which the audits didnt pick up says one California official The way they calculate depreciation is very strange If the accounts were done on a proper GAAP basis instead of some kind of FERC basis they would l ook different Even if the deal goes through the financing could be diffi cult and very expensive The state has definitively ruled out putting the f ull faith and credit of the state of California behind the proposed bonds State Treasurer Angelides has also been informed it is unlikely theyd qual ify for taxexempt status Small IPP Players Furious And while the big players talk there is increasing nervousness among small independent and alternative generators The small companies have been the biggest losers so far their representative Jan SmutnyJones was tossed off the Board of the California ISO and the closing of the California PX deprives them of the main marketing channel for their power The CEOs of la rge companies like Dynegy and Reliant are talking to Davis on a daily basis but the small companies are out of the loop They also lack the financial resources and diversity of income streams to resist problems for long Lar ge companies and the major bank creditors are also aware of the potential p olitical and relationship risks across the US if they get cast in the role of villain in California For the small companies however it is a matter of survival Some legislators in Sacramento are operating under the assumpt ion that it would take a creditor committee of the large generators to forc e bankruptcy Not so All it takes is three creditors owed at least each to apply for bankruptcy Two small companies Cal Energy and Ridgewoo d Power are already resorting to the courts to try to press for payment If bankruptcy is triggered there is immense uncertainty about what would h appen No major player we talk to is confident they can predict the outcome especially after the shock of Judge Lews unexpected ruling in Los Angele s It is likely that the issues would have to be decided ultimately by the State Supreme Court FERC and the Federal government could also be ensnared as writs fly But to many of the players that uncertain mess following ba nkruptcy looks better than certain loss in a bad deal

any questions Thanks Kristin Walsh x Aluminum Smelters DSIs Kaiser Aluminum Kaiser Aluminum has begun the recall of to workers to its Mead smelter in Washington They are beginning the process of getting their operations back into productive capacity as they await load reduction negotiations with BPA perhaps using the recall as a posturing tactic to threaten restart Kaiser wants BPA to give them per megawatt hour to shut down operations for two years beginning October competitors are being paid but it seems unlikely that BPA will budge now that spot electricity prices have reached reasonable levels in the MWh range To make a long story short Kaiser botched their chance at a great deal and is now lining up the troops to threaten BPA into signing Alcoa Aluminum Alcoa is still in talks with BC Hydro in regards to restarting its Intalco smelter operations Consequently the bottom line with the BPA load reduction agreement priced in at per MWh and a rough estimate of per MWh breakeven point on electricity prices Alcoa could go to BC Hydro with a much more aggressive bid on electricity With current market prices floating near per MWh and a MWh load reduction payment from BPA for the next two years there is a very real possibility Alcoa could profitably restart operations if prices break lower and find a stable price there Contacts close to BC Hydro are aggressively pursuing the inside track on these negotiations particularly on the Hydros side of things We are aiming to find out a potential restart date and will report when available BC Hydro BC Government BC Government has been allowed to gain intervener status in discussions regarding the Sumas power plant sitting in Northern Washington State near the Canadian border This border dispute has been going on for the last months the Canucks citing air pollution as a major public health hazard coming from a site so close to Canadian cities Now the BC government has been allowed to sit in on sitting negotiations and provide its input a large step forward for BC now that the NDP has been stripped of power On the offshore drilling front there has been no direct legislation this week although it is believed that the Greens and the remnants of the NDP environmentalists are on the ropes on this issue Sources indicate that the laborenvironmentalist split that took the House Democrats on the ANWR vote in Washington last week will likely mirror itself in the offshore drilling and forestry debates in British Columbia Many labor groups have allied themselves with corporate interests in the past and are likely to do so again if the issue of oil royalties and jobs are at stake in Northern British Columbia BC Hydro There has been no real movement this week on the BC Hydro front They are awaiting the selection of their new Chair and Board upcoming by midSeptember Bonneville Power Authority Financial Solvency Senator Patty Murray has stated she will go to the mat on the ANWR debate and that there will be no room for equivocation on this front Whether or not this opening salvo is meant as deterrence or smokescreen remains to be seen although a reliable source suggests she is not willing to change her position in exchange for increased BPA funding Sources indicate that the bill before the Senate to increase BPAs funding by billion to a total billion with the provision of annual reports to the Senate was opposed by GOP leadership in the Senate and by the White House It is likely that Murray would scrap the bill altogether unless a viable alternative emerges FERC Oversight There remains a question as to whether or not Chairman Heberts resignation at FERC will play a role in Murrays decisionmaking It is our understanding that upon Heberts resignation a vacancy will open in FERC and there are no restrictions to its partisanship since the Commission will have two Democrats and two Republicans in it That opening creates an opportunity for some individuals who were initially passed over the by White House to have another shot at becoming a FERC Commissioner We are entertaining two scenarios The White House looks to use the FERC vacancy to gain influence in the ANWR vote should labors influence not be strong enough to swing a victory The White House is confident of the ANWR victory and will appoint a Republican to the position most likely a contender on the short list being someone who was passed over recently in favor of Woods Spill Issues There are no additional spill issues that have been brought up this week We are not expecting anything substantive until the end of August to come from this area Other Dam Issues PacifiCorp and the Yakama Indian Nation have signed a preliminary agreement to file a joint competing license application with FERC for the Priest Rapids hydro project now operated by Grant County PUD Representatives of the utility and the tribe indicate their goal is to more broadly share the benefits of the twodam MW project with the region Grant County PUD which holds the existing license now uses about percent of the output the rest is under contract to public and private utilities with the regions four IOUs receiving the most This is an example of the growing influence of tribal nations on water issues in the Pacific Northwest While it is unlikely to say the least that tribal nations will take control of BPAoperated dams they will increasingly become energy players in this region Forest Fires The Chelan blaze has been controlled and there are no major forest fires which warrant disruption of electrical transmissions

Hydro talks to provide the aluminum producer a source of cheap stable energy Alcoa is still shopping around to find a good seller since the load reduction agreement with BPA is still in effect It should be noted that BCs Premier Gordon Campbell has had longstanding poor relations with Alcan Inc of Canada a competitor of Alcoas While in the opposition Campbell helped to scuttle a completion deal that would have allowed Alcan to finish a B hydroelectric power project Earlier this year BC Hydro considered a plan to refund Alcan some money for an energy buyback deal similar to the load reduction agreements south of the border If Campbell can move to secure an aluminum partner he does not have a problem with he will likely do so to that end look for Alcoa and BC Hydro talks to be productive if the Premier has anything to say about it Alcoa is still in talks with BPA on potential continued load reduction agreements In a recent shareholder meeting last week Alcoas management was peppered with questions from Wall Street fund managers regarding the BPA talks the feeling in the sector is that aluminum prices have begun to bottom out and the impetus is now to start rebuilding production in the Pacific Northwest and reestablishing revenue growth Kaiser Aluminum With the hiring of Harvey Perry as the companys new aluminum chief Kaisers longterm aluminum strategy still remains somewhat unclear As the only DSI to not have signed a load curtailment agreement with BPA they are still in discussions If anything new arises we will keep you updated BC Hydro BC Government Campbells government will be moving swiftly on the heels of the House bill to approve ANWR drilling to fast track the lifting of the moratorium on offshore oil and natural gas exploration Some of the communities in northern British Columbia such as Fort St John Dawson Creek Black Gold and Fort McMurray have had significant recent population booms and they are poised to hit critical mass as oil company money rolls into the region Currently there is debate about how to structure and site the pipeline that will run from ANWR through British Columbia Significant oil company exploration royalties will flow into local tax base coffers which will make the offshore drilling an extremely competitive business between BC and Alaska BC Hydro Hydro officials are in the process of officially courting new partners and are becoming more aggressive in their attempts to find energy buyers Due to its ability to generate cheap hydroelectric power BC Hydro is looking to be competitive player in the market avoiding its traditional subsidy of the Jobs for Power program and pursuing lucrative crossborder contracts with US firms At the same time Hydro will be moving to slice community programs anywhere from to million and outsourcing its information technology departments for savings in the million range BC Hydro whose annual revenues hover typically around million is looking at early minibudget estimates for to be in the million range Its trading subsidiary PowerEx has not come back with a refund counteroffer to California and it looks like CA will have to take this issue to court BC Hydro is in the process of selecting its new chair of the board which is looking more and more likely to be Larry Bell from Campbells transition team We have yet to pin down the name of the second candidate although we believe he is a vicepresident at West Coast Energy The selection will not likely occur for another two weeks so we do not anticipate any major policy shifts until late October or November In the meantime Campbell and Gary Collins the Finance Minister will be calling the shots on Hydros future Keep in mind that the Minister of Energy and Mines Neufeld has the official title but his power has been greatly curbed by the Premier the administration will be playing it safe until they feel they have a few knowledgeable players on board who are receptive to their agenda Bonneville Power Administration Financial Solvency After having a chance to speak with a source close to Sen Patty Murrays DWA office it has become apparent that the energy and water appropriations bill to provide BPA an additional billion in borrowing authority over the billion of existing authority it already has may be scuttled Sen Murray has been fighting a provision in that bill which would have forced BPA to come back to the Senate every year for review the White House the Senate Appropriations Committee OMB and the Budget Committee have all been opposed to the entire bill The feeling is that if the billion of additional authority would be issued the money would be coming off the back of Social Security and Medicare Eight northwest Senators will be convening on this issue over the course of the next month and a half The next time this issue will come up again is the middle of September when there is another energy bill conference Obviously now that Bushs energy bill has passed the House they will be looking to bring considerable pressure on Democratic Senators to pass the legislation we would not be surprised if a deal to extend BPA borrowing authority is linked with support for ANWR drilling Spill Issues The million spill over two Columbia River dams a few short weeks after BPA administrator Steve Wright said there would be no summer spills was very likely a political bone for the environmental groups Fish managers notably CRITFCs Bob Heinith and ODFWs Christine Mallette had stumped hard for any spill at all being better than none but they lacked survival data to show that it would benefit fish in this extremely low flow year Power operators and the Corps of Engineers questioned the models used to determine the value of the spill citing the impact of adverse tailwater conditions from low flows being compounded by spilling water making it extra hard for juvenile fish to leave the area below the dams and hence suffer higher mortality from predators like the northern pikeminnow Dam Breaching Congressman Jim McDermott DWA recently announced that he was introducing a bill that would pave the way for breaching the four lower Snake dams It would also call for another study on the economic effects of breaching and authorize the Corps of Engineers to partially remove the dams if the Secretary of Commerce finds it necessary to satisfy ESA Clean Water Act or tribal treaty obligations The Bush Administration has so far failed to allocate funds to implement the Salmon Recovery Plan to avoid dam removal McDermott said in a July press release If this bill nudges them to take the plan seriously and it is successful in preventing the breaching of the dams then no one would be happier than I would he said Now is the time to plan for all contingencies Cosponsored by Tom Petri RWI and other representativesbut no others from the Northwestthe bill will have difficulty getting out of committee where opposition has massed quickly led by Butch Otter RID and Doc Hastings RWA The two issued Dear Colleague letters asking fellow members not to support McDermotts bill Pacific Northwest utilities and energy interests have battled long and hard with salmon environmentalists over the issue with dam breaching The environmentalists took their lumps earlier this year when energy prices shot up and left them nowhere to run politically Now that energy prices have come down again they will continue to beat their drum over salmon preservation although they are much weakened now Forestry Issues Forest Fires One of the largest forest fires in the Pacific Northwest the Thirty Mile Fire which claimed the lives of four firefighters is under control this week The only other major fire in this region currently is the acre Union Valley fire in Southeast Washington State The fire is three and a half miles north of Chelan WA and evacuations of residences continue in upper Union Valley and in Washington Creek drainage The fire continues to spread north into Washington Creek drainage Burnout operations on the northeast flank of the fire were successfully completed We have not seen any reports of this fire disrupting any electrical lines or significantly hampering transmission

spite of better than expected levels of conservation the states electricity expenditures over the last month rose to an average of Mday The recent rate increases mean more spending by the state and that calls into question the reassuring Angelides scenario for Californias budget prospects later this year The California Budget Crunch Even more worrisome than a idle Plan Z is increasing evidence that last months conference call with State Treasurer Angelides was a little misleading During that conference call Angelides claimed that State Comptroller Connell and many in the financial committee had the numbers wrong Angelides argued that B already spent to buy power since January was really the total amount of authorized spending through late August In fact he said only B of that had been spent Sources now indicate that Angelides was technically correct if you use spent to mean only the amount of money for which checks had been written This is different than the amount of money California had already promised to energy suppliers who had already supplied energy to the state In fact when Angelides was speaking the state had in fact already promised to pay B for energy it had already consumed the total committed has topped B By the time the state gets its power bonds auctioned in August they will have already spent all B and be back to dipping into the General Fund The idea of RANs being auctioned before the power bonds get issued is still an option if the general fund doesnt make it to August The nearest answer to both of these cash flow deficits lies in part in the painful process that the legislature is undertaking now another round of huge electricity rate hikes to securitize debt issuance Then the hope is that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings wholesale rates down and the debts can be repaid The only near term path to bringing generating assets on line immediately is the MW from QF plants which are off line because

Hides State Budget Concerns House Committee to Vote on Energy Relief Edisons MOU Doubtful The unusually calm settling over the California legislature about SoCal Edisons potential bankruptcy has finally affected the relentlessly optimistic investment bank analysts and other company shareholders We have reported that through all plans from BZ there is not a solid plan to save this company and now executives are even more fearful that this predictions may come to fruition Over the last few days Edison executives have begun pointing hard at the CPUC meeting this Friday as a makeorbreak event for the company The is because after the meeting Daviss MOU plan to buy SoCals grid will have no chance of preventing a potential bankruptcy This plan is essentially dead although Governor Daivs has yet to say this in a press releases The final nail will happen after the CPUC adjourns its Friday meeting without voting on several necessary MOU provisions Unless the CPUC makes a last minute emergency amendment to their agenda the deal will be dead despite SoCals support for letting the deal stand past its deadline Sources indicate that CPUC President Loretta Lynch holds reservations on the MOU and continues to distance herself from Davis Attempting to influence policy making Edison executives have spent the last few investor phone conferences warning that June would see substantially increased risks for a creditorinduced bankruptcy if the Davis plan dies at CPUC This is interesting since no one else seems to have been focused on the date until Edison began mentioning it late last week However there is no more or less threat of bankruptcy than there is now or will be in two weeks As reported several times earlier most everyone had given up on the MOU long before this Fridays CPUC meeting Plan Z Shows Little Progress Meanwhile the unhurried pace toward a Plan Z that we reported last Friday has gained little progress Legislators continue to pinpoint a plan that will secure reelection votes and at the same time weigh the need for rate hikes for Californias corporate and home electricity users As they hash it out the state is spending even more on electricity purchases In spite of better than expected levels of conservation the states electricity expenditures over the last month rose to an average of Mday The recent rate increases mean more spending by the state and that calls into question the reassuring Angelides scenario for Californias budget prospects later this year The California Budget Crunch Even more worrisome than a idle Plan Z is increasing evidence that last months conference call with State Treasurer Angelides was a little misleading During that conference call Angelides claimed that State Comptroller Connell and many in the financial committee had the numbers wrong Angelides argued that B already spent to buy power since January was really the total amount of authorized spending through late August In fact he said only B of that had been spent Sources now indicate that Angelides was technically correct if you use spent to mean only the amount of money for which checks had been written This is different than the amount of money California had already promised to energy suppliers who had already supplied energy to the state In fact when Angelides was speaking the state had in fact already promised to pay B for energy it had already consumed the total committed has topped B By the time the state gets its power bonds auctioned in August they will have already spent all B and be back to dipping into the General Fund The idea of RANs being auctioned before the power bonds get issued is still an option if the general fund doesnt make it to August The nearest answer to both of these cash flow deficits lies in part in the painful process that the legislature is undertaking now another round of huge electricity rate hikes to securitize debt issuance Then the hope is that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings wholesale rates down and the debts can be repaid The only near term path to bringing generating assets on line immediately is the MW from QF plants which are off line because of cash flow problems Settling their needs is wrapped up in settling the PGE and Edison trade creditor issues which makes the legislatures leisurely approach to the rate hikehaircut situation all the more troublesome Energy Relief The House Energy Commerce Committee is scheduled to vote on HR the Emergency Electricity Relief Act tomorrow at am The bill which was twice postponed and does not include any provisions on price caps but during the course of the markup sources indicate that it is possible even likely that a Democrat could offer a price cap amendment Rep Waxman DCA offered a price cap amendment at an earlier markup of the bill at the subcommittee level The Waxman amendment was rejected along party lines all Republicans and Democrats voted nay Sources inside Joe Bartons office report that staff and members have been meeting to work out a compromise on the price cap issue but nothing has been resolved As of this afternoon those discussions have been terminated in favor of an open discourse in the Committee tomorrow Since an agreement was not reached compromise language is not expected to be offered as an amendment tomorrow If it is it would not be something that leaders on the Republican and Democrat sides have crafted together and therefore would not likely pass Sources indicate that the committee does expect Waxman and possibly others to offer price cap language but it is not expected to pass

Vince Milnthorp Rob Presto Kevin Ribeiro Claudio Shapiro Richard Steffes James Tawney Mark Tholan Scott Whitman Britt Subject California Update Importance High Executive Summary CPUC likely to pass rate hikes tomorrow politicians bowing to the inevitable Many questions still unanswered most notably sizestructure of rate increase and past utility debts Past undercollect major sticking point with little help available from transmission deal or longterm contracts Reliant seeking relief in circuit court from emergency orders large generators increasingly angry with Davis blame game QFs waiting for details of rate hike new price formula crucial to SoCals ability to make payments Bankruptcy outlook increasingly complex but debt rescheduling remains subject to failure In our late Friday report we wrote Davis could order rate hikes as a last ditch effort but this action would not address the undercollection issue There is still a high chance of bankruptcy by either the larger generators commercial paper holders and less now but still very possible the QFs as time is running out Events are unfolding exactly along these lines Why Rate Hikes Now CPUC President Lorretta Lynch came out this weekend in favor of rate hikes Davis and many legislators recognize that rate hikes are the quickest solution but that there is a potentially painful political price attached Davis will probably come out in support of a structured rate system passing on most of the hikes to business and industrial users Other California politicians are starting to face reality of rate hikes The CalEnergy ruling massively reduced their leverage over the creditors who are now able to sell outside the state if they can get similar relief from the courts And its not just the QFsthe giant Reliant Energy is appealing to the Ninth Circuit Court in San Francisco against Federal Judge Frank Damrells series of rulings forcing large generators to continue to sell to California What Impact Will the Rate Hikes Have Rate rises will stabilize the situation going forward but there will be a messy scramble to assign blame and liability for past debts Some form of rescheduling is a possibility but there are any number of accidents that could happen and yet result in bankruptcy for the utilities if they dont seek protection from creditors themselves UndercollectionNet Short Still Unaddressed All of these developments fail to address the past undercollection or the bond revenue plan Still the passage of rate hikes could speed up the legislature on these fronts as well The bulk of the rate hikes will go first to repay the DWR then to the commercial creditors Absent the transmission line deal the bond revenue plan would have to be restructured to repay the past undercollect Longterm power contracts are still relatively meaningless until when the majority of the contracts kick in Large Power Suppliers Losing Patience Relations are also deteriorating between Davis and the large power suppliers Davis for the most part has been very careful to cultivate them during the drawn out negotiations talking to several of the main CEOs almost daily But state legislators and officials are rapidly trying to initiate investigations of alleged market manipulation and overcharging to deflect the growing political heat from themselves This is only agitating the larger generators more as every day passes If Reliant loses their case it may also tempt some of the larger generators to force the issue to bankruptcy Whats more financial creditors are also waiting with growing impatience and the utilities themselves are contemplating voluntary bankruptcy PGE in particular simply will not agree to Davis transmission lines deal as it stands and a bankruptcy workout may offer the best albeit uncertain chance of a return to eventual health someday QFs Listening and Waiting But the largest threat as we have been saying is not from the major energy companies It is the small companies known as QFs that will be the triggers if bankruptcy occurs Remember these two facts The QFs are a diverse group of companies and it only takes three of them to force bankruptcy and many of them have to move in court quickly or lose any possible standing for future court action It is in the interests of a number of creditors to wait and hope that a negotiated settlement can be reached but others have a large incentive to game the situation and threaten to force bankruptcy Other bullish news PGE gets extended forbearance until April th from its banks and SoCal announces that it will pay some QFs The actual amount of payments to the QFs is still subject to the CPUC approving a revised pricing formula that is satisfactory to the QFs That decision should come tomorrow Outlook Last week we wrote that the QFs felt there was no point in filing today because they want to see what they can get from the legislature this week and in all likelihood what they can get from the CPUC hearing next week The next hours will be crucial Only massive rate hikes or higher roughly would address the undercollect issue and Davis is unlikely to authorize those As one source told us the age of denial is mostly coming to an end and that is the main source of hope that California can begin to move forward from this But the situation is so complex and there are so many players and angles involved that a negotiated solution to the past debt problem will still be complicated and vulnerable to failure

Summary Bond Issuance to be B with year term tax exempt and nonexempt Angelides in favor of wind fall profit tax Opposed to current discussion between Davis and Socal in regards to Socal paying off the generators over years with a year grace period What decisions on rate components are necessary before you can sell bonds The big things we need are that the PUC must enter into agreement with DWR essentially warranting that sufficient revenues from rates will be availabl e for purchasing power It is really their job to define what each party need s to pay for power We need to give assurance to the investment community tha t whatever the overall rate is the state will get enough to pay its bonds However if the utilities challenge the decision it could stall the bond issuance What do you think will be the size of the first bond issue Based on what is currently possible and what the legislature has authorize d around bn The PUC has allowed us to sell north of bn but we anticipate that bn is absorbable Until the administration provides details for this office and the public on what its costs of buying power ar e and what it needs in terms of funding what will drive it is that number n ot what the PUC has said The issuance may well be a single bn issue or a series of smaller ones done together eg bn each weeks apart What is the total size of the market for CA taxexempt bonds What we do normally is bn in bonds for various revenues or general obligations In the CA infrastructure rate reductions bonds was a bn issuance and this was handled well This is not exclusively a CA market Around bn of these bonds is sold each year We anticipate that the bonds will be taxexempt and nonexempt What is the total of electric supply contracts that are firm enough to require funding We have estimates The DWR is buying power and lets say power costs and its portion of rates is This bond issuance covers the diff between and So the bond issuance is a way to cover the gap However if power prices do not come down you cannot keep borrowing If we issue more than bn in bonds I have to see the whole financial plan The implication is that he will not keep this plan secret What will be the term mix of the bond issues Overall term is expected to be in the year range I do not know the mix Do you have the ability to do bridging tax anticipation notes or anything like that to take care of the general fund The very purpose of the bridge loan is that we are taking a taxable and taxexempt bridge loan until bonds are issued In order for us to issue bonds a number of steps have to occur I would hope that the PUC and DWR d o what they have to do realistically by June Then the bond issuance would come semi allatonce In other words either all at once or something like billion every three weeks Are all of the general funds assets in cash or are some in the form of a less liquid receivable We have a lot of liquidity in real cash in general fund We have a cash flow We have the ability in pooled money investment accounts so that we ca n go out to five years We have bnplus in that account What is the minimum working capital required in the general fund for daytoday operations It depends and goes up and down On any given day we are doing on the order of mm There is a bn budget between the general funds and special fund Are you discussing the DWR contracting in relation to the required funding Do you have a veto on the deals struck This is all in the administrations court What we have asked for is t he information We have asked for this today by letter We have to move from working with or banks to a public offering which means public disclosure The general fund has been making advances to buy power but we want to get out of that business and to stop the bn plus drain on general fund from arranging an interim loan What is the credit risk from industry or other large users cherry picking o r selfselecting There are limits on the options out there ABX has limited the ability o f people to opt out of the system If you do allow them to opt out what do they have to pay to preserve the revenue stream The agreement between the DWR and the PUC will say that through a financing order we will get you t he revenue to service the bonds even if it adjusts rates This will be a covenant that the money will be made available If an initiative is launched could it create enough uncertainty to have an effect on ABIX or the bond issuance What about Harvey proofing W hat is the direct state participation The states role is infrastructure and economic development Bonds wil l be issued in name of DWR only to pay for power the state is buying not to rep ay utility deb I dont think the state will repay utility debt The stat e can buy power in or out of Chapter There will be no participation by the state bank I know Harvey well and he and I agree on a number of things For example I am cosponsoring the public power authority We should not pu t the state in the business of refinancing utility debt I dont think mo st consumer groups realize that we are selling bonds to pay for power I very much want and it is in my interest to repay the general fund At the sam e time that this office is financing the purchase of energy the fundamental problem is the price we are being charged by the generatorsthe ransom that is being demanded by the generators I agree with Harvey that as of this current time the generators are winning We will have to consider excess profits taxes or if the generators continue they have increased their prices tenfold The generators they bought a set of plants for bn Since January the state has spent over bn If the generators dont ta ke their foot off our throat they may leave us no option but to take back plants under emergency power So let them justify those rates What caus es the problem is the generators jacking up prices to the point where they wil l make us do something about it What is the measurable size premium that will have to be paid based on the most current estimates of bond issue size Measurable is the wrong choice of words We dont know how many basis points If it is more than bn we will begin to feel it Also I am not for that proposal to allow the utilities to pay off the generators over years with a year grace period They should work that out themselves not on the backs of ratepayers The perspective here is th at they did very very well in and They upstreamed billions

deal going through is a onetime quick vote if deal has t o go to hearings it will probably die If not transmission deal legislators will seize assets and seek price ca ps Asset seizure would target power contracts then power plants as a resul t the endless court battles will ensue but this gives Davis opportunity to continue to blame generators and marketers Bankruptcy for SoCal is still the most likely scenario with the QFs or SoCal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended Congressional democrats rally around Davis and seize opportunity to blame the Administration Transmission Deal and Democratic Support As Governor Gray Davis scrambles to build support for his SoCal Ed transmission proposal one thing is evident the longer the deal is exposed to public debate the less likely it is to pass In fact politicians have been so leery of the deal that Davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor to introduce the bill in the Senate In the eyes of many Democrati c legislators and all Republicans forcing SoCal Edison into bankruptcy is looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines that is wh y the Governors senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick up or down vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week The bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoi d debate however if there is an opening within the next two weeks and Davis feels he has enough support it will be pushed through Because the SoCal deal needs every piece in place as negotiated by Davis team the team wants no amendments allowed on the Assembly floor and a quick vote If thi s unlikely fast track strategy fails for Davis the prospects for the transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily keep in mind that th at it cannot even be resubmitted to the Assembly until it has been vetted by SoCal Edison attorneys According to sources the legislature is going to try to modify the Memorandum of Understanding between Gov Davis and SCE However the Senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to pass even a modified MOU Burton reportedly believes that at lea st Democrats will vote against it along with the Republicans The more that bill gets picked apart in public the uglier it looks and the more Democrat s will realize that they are all alone in supporting it Another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of SoCal and not the state Among other things the state is overpaying by about billion for the transmission lines Additionally the MOU Davis has with SoCal Ed nearly matches point for point the deal Davis condemned with PG E Asset Seizures Since before the PGE bankruptcy filing we have maintained that asset seizures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasing ly frustrated Democrats Davis legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law on eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across California to existing power contracts negotiated by whom Daviss calls profiteering power brokers Of course everyone in the Governors office understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal courts and would be a legal nightmare there are a few minor Constitutiona l legal and interstate commerce problems The main thing is that the seizing would continue Daviss main approach to this problem management by press conference and it would put the Governor and Democrats on the right side of the issue punishing the capitalist leeches According to one senior Democratic legislator there is movement within Democratic members of the state Assembly to demand that Davis agree to seize the power contracts in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase Of cours e taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking the power plants The appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would allegedly put California state officials in charge of where the power is sold and reduce markups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide spotmarket power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the pric e through the roof Price Caps One strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur depends powerfully on decisions made by the three Republican Governors from Colorado Alaska and Wyoming These three were the key players during the Portland Western Governors Conference last January and according to senio r White House officials it took the personal and prolonged intervention of President Bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous call for price caps from the governors If they had signed that price cap appeal the administration source said we would already have price caps So if they start to make it clear something has changed we will have to listen Sources indicate that if these Republican leaders begin to rethin k their opposition to price caps the Bush administration will be forced to reconsider price caps as a remedy for the West Cost Plus Caps Think of these as Republican price caps in that their fir st duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to provide power into the affected grid Just to give some idea of magnitudes in a cost plus deal current discussions would put a cap on power costs at something like per kilowatt hour That is a long way down from the August futures contract that is pricing in per kilowatt hour but a lo ng way above last Augusts kwhr price and a particularly long way above t he cost of generating this power which is something like kwh MarketPrice Exceptions The option allows the Bush administration to hav e political credit for imposing price caps As we write FERC is currently i n the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generating power in California Duke Dynegy AES Reliant and Williams The permit grants a further threeyear waiver that allows them to sell power into California in the existing whatever price the market will bear In other words FERC could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy at the market price perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market share and then power to control prices would revert back to FERC Technically in granting the extension of these permits FERC has to establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield mark et power that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding power at crucial times Of course FERC has just found on three different rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the subsequent price spikes But that would mean FERC would have to want to wie ld effective power over price capping in California and they have shown no desire on that front The escape clause for FERC simply to renew the waiver s is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than of an electricity market and none of these companies come close In other words the waivers option lets FERC escape if the Bush administration and FERC commissioners really want to escape Once again th at decision may be more in the hands of the three Republican Governors than anywhere else in the country But you can be certain that in the past few days Administration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabilities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plants Democrats Seize Opportunity to blame Bush Senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could come in as high as billion which would destroy state finances for a decade Add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear everyday about their own direct outofpocket electricity costs they paid billion for electricity in billion in and are expected to pa y billion this year ten times the rate two years ago Then of course they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredible numbers home in a very direct way and well who can blame the Democrats f or saying there is a simple solution but the White House wont allow it National level Democrats realize Californias power crisis is a prime opportunity to chastise the Bush administration and its freemarket advocat e FERC Chairman Hebert over their resistance to summer price caps As Californias leaders calculate this years taxpayer energy bill at potentially billion a rogues gallery of Democratic congressional leaders are currently meeting with Governor Davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across the eight western states of the power grid with a singular message the solution to all western voters electricity problems lies righ t in Washington DC at FERC headquarters controlled by Bush Administration appointees And as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its possible impact on control over the US Congress comes more into focus the solutions articulated by Californias Democrats who sense they have Republicans on the run in the West become less and less fr ee market focused The two strains of the Democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps

<21993848.1075843452041.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kristin.walsh@enron.com,2001-04-27 09:25:00,California Update Cc report contains confidential and sensitive information Please treat with discretion Executive Summary FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives Politically Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis from an economic perspective he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan most notably its exclusion of outofstate generators June st kill clause for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected billion power bill this summereconomic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement QF bid for advance payments from PGE likely to fail in bankruptcy court New generation delays probable because of StateQF squabbling Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal FERC Fallout The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action but is not Rather it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame Once they are politically inoculated the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions Moreover the Administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan Something Less than Effective Price Caps From Daviss point of view the FERC plan has four major flaws The order applies only to California not to the rest of the west NonCalifornia generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California As the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage emergency and does not require any collusion Even when the price caps kick in they are based on the costplus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap The generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control If Davis doesnt sign on to the regional grid by June st then he will have to live with June nd headlines blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California could therefore pay as much as billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of PGE and SCE These sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the FERC andor the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about days One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for longterm power deals The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture The countrys largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PGE Meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the QFs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted If the QFs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the mw of gasfired QF capacity will remain offline Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for longterm contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the MOU for the SCE bailout plan The analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points For example one of the elements of the MOU is a nonbypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid This is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity This makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds According to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company For this and other reasons even if the Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose LongTerm Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to disclose the details of the longterm power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis Even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay

Meet Their May th Deadline Due to Lack of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuancebridge loan by the May th deadline Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart According to sources both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis The Democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund Davis would double dip into the fund Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor However it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place Additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the longterm power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by July If not the state may be in breach of contract Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May th having a bond issuance by July st will be very difficult The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately billion However the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan AB X and AB X AB X authorizes the DWR to sell up to billion in bonds This bill passed the Senate in March but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support AB X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts However sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen currently in AB X Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund For instance Tony Strickland has stated that only of the bonds or approximately billion should be issued Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday Additionally Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount B Lenders JP Morgan B Lehman Brothers B Bear Stearns M Tax Exempt Portion Of the B B is expected to be taxexempt Projected Interest Rate Taxable Rate TaxExempt Rate Current Projected Blended IR Maturity Date August For more details please contact me at Bill SB X Passed the Senate Yesterday but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB X yesterday which authorizes billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority The billion authorized under SB X is not the same as the billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward Again the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations Without the details of the longterm power contracts the governor has negotiated the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power Also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the California Public Power and Conservation Authority However this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August th however some decision will likely be made earlier According to sources the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal though SoCal has signed it The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash The second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB X bridge loan stating that the DWR would received of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount In other words the state will get paid before the utilities If this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments

Coordinating the California Legislature CPUCs Rate Setting Authority In Question Highlights from the SoCal Investor Conference Call MOU As reported earlier SB XX the leading SoCal rescue adopted by the CA Senate has undergone minor amendments by the California Assembly Three important revisions on the bill are In regard to commercial rates the assembly has now left open the definition of large or industrial users by eliminating the previous kWh usage requirement This change could enable the Assembly to categoriz e either smaller or larger consumers into the industrialcommercial user stat us The bill would not become effective unless SB XX is signed into law S B XX authored by Sen Speier is regarding the CPUCs authority over utilities and generators in California it places certain generation that w as purchased by Reliant Dynegy etc from the utilities after deregulation under PUC authority The States purchase of the SoCal Ed transmission lines has been remo ved AB XX was also revised by the Assembly with many of the deleted provision s duplicate in SB XX such as the conservation lands and the option to buy the transmission lines Additionally AB XX can not be enacted unless SB XX the windfall profits bill is signed The joining of XX to SB XX and of XX to XX is very likely a method by which the Assembly is pressuring the governor to sign these other bills which otherwise might no t have been enrolled However the joining of these bills makes their passag e more difficult The remaining provisions of AB XX are as follows Renewables Portfolio Direct Access Ratepayer Refund Account changed the name to Ratepayer Benefit Account Balancing Account for SCE procurement of power DRC replaced with nonbypassable charge option for MOU This includes reference to balancing account recovery of reasonable procurement costs a nd the prohibition of reasonableness review on contracts by PUC Putting the MOU to a Vote The Speaker feels that everything in these bills has been discussed already so nothing is really new Hertzberg met with advisors Wednesday night pm to decide if the Assembly will convene on Friday It probably has a lot to do with the ability to get enough members support of these measures and willingness to go back to Sacramento Many are vacationing some in other countries If there is an Assembly session on Friday he plans to have an informational hearing on the measure today If the Assemblys session f ails to convene Friday it is unclear what he intends to do On the other side of the equation it is unlikely that Senator Burton will bring the Senate back into session to approve this bill The Senate wont even consider it until it comes back from recess but the Assembly feels it is their responsibilit y thereby putting the onus back on the Senate Apparently there is really no coordination between the leadership of the different houses While SB XX and AB XX are the most publicized bills neither bill will be the actual legislative vehicle for these provisions The proposed content of these bills will be amended into other bills which are further along in the process thereby eliminating the need to waive a number of rules and hold numerous hearings This will speed up the process Apparently the Speaker s office has not yet identified the actual bills that will be used But they hope to find bills that are so far along in the legislative process that if the Assembly passes the bills they will not be able to be amended in the Senate It does appear that the Assembly does intend to send these through as two separate bills though with the SB XX provisions in one bill and the AB XX provisions in another CPUC Rate Setting Authority or Rate Setting Minority Recently the California Assembly has pursued a legislative provision that would enable lawmakers to abrogate the CPUCs ratesetting authority and hand over that power to the California legislature Politically this gives the Governor the ability to say if rates increase automatically that he did n ot approve of the rate increase and there is nothing he can do about it But it also gives Wall Street buyers of Californias revenue bonds assurance s that no matter what the need there will always be enough revenue to back revenue bonds payments thus deniability to ratepayers and certainty for bondholders Were this provision to pass the CPUC would still retain oversight of rates for the investor owned utilities As for DWR under the draft rate agreeme nt proposed by the CPUC it contains a mechanism for the Commission to use in setting electricity rates that satisfy DWRs revenue requirement DWRs revenue requirements include bondrelated costs operating costs such as power purchase costs and administrative costs ABX provided for energyrelated bonds to be sold by the state to support DWRs power purchases Because power contracts require DWR to pay for power before it makes bond payments and DWR must sell power to obtain revenues the ratesetting mechanism in the rate agreement also applies to DWRs power purchases not just its bond payments Note that if the Commission adopts a rate agreement it becomes irrevocable The draft agreement also includes a provision stating that the CPUC will take the DWR at its word as to its retail revenue requirements The agreement would require that the CPUC set rates meeting DWRs requirements in either or days The day mechanism applies whenever DWR submits a revenue requirement The day mechanism applies when DWR anticipates or actually draws on its reserves The rate agreement includes an enforceable covenant by the CPUC specifyin g how the Commission will set rates to meet DWRs revenue requirements wh ich includes both bond costs and operating costs If the CPUCs draft rate agreement is approved there will be no legisla tive or PUC oversight of any of those costs and no opportunity for public comme nt for as long as bonds are outstanding If a rate agreement can be avoided there will be opportunities to review and alter the agreements demand management and administrative costs Either way power contract costs rema in an obligation of DWR and cannot be altered except by mutual consent of DWR and the contractor SoCal Edison Investor Conference Call The following are notes from the SoCal Edison conference call with holders of defaulted debt July PDT In order for California to sell their revenuebonds with an investment grade rating two criterion must be met there must be a ratesupported dedicated revenue stream in place and the legislature must have the powe r to override of the CPUCs rate setting authority and raise rates if necessary The second criterion however faces significant opposition fr om the California State Constitution Regarding the DWR rate requirement Craver the spokesperson for SoCal stated that SoCal is evaluating the numbers particularly on the DWR side He stated that if you accept their output of models and numbers it appears this requirement would fit within the existing rate structure However w e need to remember that deregulation started with forecasts that proved to be wrong Therefore this is risky in that SoCal is faced with fixed revenues and floating costs Unlike DWR SoCal has no ability to adjust rates based on costs making floating natural gas prices a risk Prudential asked if based on the Hertzberg legislation the sale of the transmission assets is now off the table SoCal responded that this is correct Prudential asked if SoCal could then anticipate more securitization ie be securitized for all but million with an optio n to buy the transmission assets at book for years SoCal responded that i t was unclear what the pricing of the transmission assets would be but there would be an option for the state to purchase the transmission assets Prudential asked about the status of the remaining nonlegislative implementing decisions on the MOU and if the legislation XX and XX contains them SoCal responded that there are outstanding issues remaini ng for implementing the MOU Ratemaking for the utilities retained generation The PUC is holding hearings on this issue this week These hearings have slowed the process A decision is expected by the end of August A procurement plan for the utility This plan is before the PUC SoCal suggested the PUC may be waiting to see what passes the legislature before acting on this point Regardless the company needs an adequate balancing account with an automatic rate trigger Clarification on the utility holding companys position regarding st priority On this front the PUC asserted its jurisdiction over all three utilities and their holding companies The three holding companies have challenged this decision Commissioner Bilas has written a draft decision in favor of the challenge a final decision is expected as soon as Thursday This would clarify that the utilities have first call on investment from th e holding companies but that the holding companies are not obligated to pay the debts of the utilities Deutsche Bank asked if in SoCals numbers reported to date it was assuming the charges for ancillary services SoCal responded that DWR had confirmed as of January that it would pick up these charges These charges would otherwise amount to million billion in additional revenue requirement for the utility Based on FERC rulings SoCal had not been counting on paying these charges so they are not reflected in the companys numbers However SoCal will be paying grid management and uplif t charges They anticipate paying some portion of these charges This cou ld potentially require an amended URG filing Citigroup asked where Edison stands on the Edison Mission Energy issues Edison responded that they are working on new facilities on

final bidders exce pt for Hopewell which is done There is no specific timeline on when the dea ls will be announced but it is a matter of days to a week Appalucia Management asked if on SoCals generation DWR is assuming a costplus or retail rate SoCal responded that it uses costofservice bas ed rates The return on the rate basis is approximately cents The stipulated covers SoCals generation

Coordinating the California Legislature CPUCs Rate Setting Authority In Question Highlights from the SoCal Investor Conference Call MOU As reported earlier SB XX the leading SoCal rescue adopted by the CA Senate has undergone minor amendments by the California Assembly Three important revisions on the bill are In regard to commercial rates the assembly has now left open the definition of large or industrial users by eliminating the previous kWh usage requirement This change could enable the Assembly to categoriz e either smaller or larger consumers into the industrialcommercial user stat us The bill would not become effective unless SB XX is signed into law S B XX authored by Sen Speier is regarding the CPUCs authority over utilities and generators in California it places certain generation that w as purchased by Reliant Dynegy etc from the utilities after deregulation under PUC authority The States purchase of the SoCal Ed transmission lines has been remo ved AB XX was also revised by the Assembly with many of the deleted provision s duplicate in SB XX such as the conservation lands and the option to buy the transmission lines Additionally AB XX can not be enacted unless SB XX the windfall profits bill is signed The joining of XX to SB XX and of XX to XX is very likely a method by which the Assembly is pressuring the governor to sign these other bills which otherwise might no t have been enrolled However the joining of these bills makes their passag e more difficult The remaining provisions of AB XX are as follows Renewables Portfolio Direct Access Ratepayer Refund Account changed the name to Ratepayer Benefit Account Balancing Account for SCE procurement of power DRC replaced with nonbypassable charge option for MOU This includes reference to balancing account recovery of reasonable procurement costs a nd the prohibition of reasonableness review on contracts by PUC Putting the MOU to a Vote The Speaker feels that everything in these bills has been discussed already so nothing is really new Hertzberg met with advisors Wednesday night pm to decide if the Assembly will convene on Friday It probably has a lot to do with the ability to get enough members support of these measures and willingness to go back to Sacramento Many are vacationing some in other countries If there is an Assembly session on Friday he plans to have an informational hearing on the measure today If the Assemblys session f ails to convene Friday it is unclear what he intends to do On the other side of the equation it is unlikely that Senator Burton will bring the Senate back into session to approve this bill The Senate wont even consider it until it comes back from recess but the Assembly feels it is their responsibilit y thereby putting the onus back on the Senate Apparently there is really no coordination between the leadership of the different houses While SB XX and AB XX are the most publicized bills neither bill will be the actual legislative vehicle for these provisions The proposed content of these bills will be amended into other bills which are further along in the process thereby eliminating the need to waive a number of rules and hold numerous hearings This will speed up the process Apparently the Speaker s office has not yet identified the actual bills that will be used But they hope to find bills that are so far along in the legislative process that if the Assembly passes the bills they will not be able to be amended in the Senate It does appear that the Assembly does intend to send these through as two separate bills though with the SB XX provisions in one bill and the AB XX provisions in another CPUC Rate Setting Authority or Rate Setting Minority Recently the California Assembly has pursued a legislative provision that would enable lawmakers to abrogate the CPUCs ratesetting authority and hand over that power to the California legislature Politically this gives the Governor the ability to say if rates increase automatically that he did n ot approve of the rate increase and there is nothing he can do about it But it also gives Wall Street buyers of Californias revenue bonds assurance s that no matter what the need there will always be enough revenue to back revenue bonds payments thus deniability to ratepayers and certainty for bondholders Were this provision to pass the CPUC would still retain oversight of rates for the investor owned utilities As for DWR under the draft rate agreeme nt proposed by the CPUC it contains a mechanism for the Commission to use in setting electricity rates that satisfy DWRs revenue requirement DWRs revenue requirements include bondrelated costs operating costs such as power purchase costs and administrative costs ABX provided for energyrelated bonds to be sold by the state to support DWRs power purchases Because power contracts require DWR to pay for power before it makes bond payments and DWR must sell power to obtain revenues the ratesetting mechanism in the rate agreement also applies to DWRs power purchases not just its bond payments Note that if the Commission adopts a rate agreement it becomes irrevocable The draft agreement also includes a provision stating that the CPUC will take the DWR at its word as to its retail revenue requirements The agreement would require that the CPUC set rates meeting DWRs requirements in either or days The day mechanism applies whenever DWR submits a revenue requirement The day mechanism applies when DWR anticipates or actually draws on its reserves The rate agreement includes an enforceable covenant by the CPUC specifyin g how the Commission will set rates to meet DWRs revenue requirements wh ich includes both bond costs and operating costs If the CPUCs draft rate agreement is approved there will be no legisla tive or PUC oversight of any of those costs and no opportunity for public comme nt for as long as bonds are outstanding If a rate agreement can be avoided there will be opportunities to review and alter the agreements demand management and administrative costs Either way power contract costs rema in an obligation of DWR and cannot be altered except by mutual consent of DWR and the contractor SoCal Edison Investor Conference Call The following are notes from the SoCal Edison conference call with holders of defaulted debt July PDT In order for California to sell their revenuebonds with an investment grade rating two criterion must be met there must be a ratesupported dedicated revenue stream in place and the legislature must have the powe r to override of the CPUCs rate setting authority and raise rates if necessary The second criterion however faces significant opposition fr om the California State Constitution Regarding the DWR rate requirement Craver the spokesperson for SoCal stated that SoCal is evaluating the numbers particularly on the DWR side He stated that if you accept their output of models and numbers it appears this requirement would fit within the existing rate structure However w e need to remember that deregulation started with forecasts that proved to be wrong Therefore this is risky in that SoCal is faced with fixed revenues and floating costs Unlike DWR SoCal has no ability to adjust rates based on costs making floating natural gas prices a risk Prudential asked if based on the Hertzberg legislation the sale of the transmission assets is now off the table SoCal responded that this is correct Prudential asked if SoCal could then anticipate more securitization ie be securitized for all but million with an optio n to buy the transmission assets at book for years SoCal responded that i t was unclear what the pricing of the transmission assets would be but there would be an option for the state to purchase the transmission assets Prudential asked about the status of the remaining nonlegislative implementing decisions on the MOU and if the legislation XX and XX contains them SoCal responded that there are outstanding issues remaini ng for implementing the MOU Ratemaking for the utilities retained generation The PUC is holding hearings on this issue this week These hearings have slowed the process A decision is expected by the end of August A procurement plan for the utility This plan is before the PUC SoCal suggested the PUC may be waiting to see what passes the legislature before acting on this point Regardless the company needs an adequate balancing account with an automatic rate trigger Clarification on the utility holding companys position regarding st priority On this front the PUC asserted its jurisdiction over all three utilities and their holding companies The three holding companies have challenged this decision Commissioner Bilas has written a draft decision in favor of the challenge a final decision is expected as soon as Thursday This would clarify that the utilities have first call on investment from th e holding companies but that the holding companies are not obligated to pay the debts of the utilities Deutsche Bank asked if in SoCals numbers reported to date it was assuming the charges for ancillary services SoCal responded that DWR had confirmed as of January that it would pick up these charges These charges would otherwise amount to million billion in additional revenue requirement for the utility Based on FERC rulings SoCal had not been counting on paying these charges so they are not reflected in the companys numbers However SoCal will be paying grid management and uplif t charges They anticipate paying some portion of these charges This cou ld potentially require an amended URG filing Citigroup asked where Edison stands on the Edison Mission Energy issues Edison responded that they are working on new facilities on the bank side The current facilities expire on October th or th Edison indicated it is in the process of finalizing sales of approximately MW of nonstrategic assets They are in negotiations with the final bidders exce pt for Hopewell which is done There is no specific timeline on when the dea ls will be announced but it is a matter of days to a week Appalucia Management asked if on SoCals generation DWR is assuming a costplus or retail rate SoCal responded that it uses costofservice bas ed rates The return on the rate basis is approximately cents The stipulated covers SoCals generation its contracted generation QF costs which were quoted as the most significant portion and uncollectables This is driven by gas costs for the QFs Revenue is fixed at

Meet Their May th Deadline Due to Lack of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuancebridge loan by the May th deadline Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart According to sources both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis The Democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund Davis would double dip into the fund Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor However it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place Additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the longterm power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by July If not the state may be in breach of contract Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May th having a bond issuance by July st will be very difficult The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately billion However the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan AB X and AB X AB X authorizes the DWR to sell up to billion in bonds This bill passed the Senate in March but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support AB X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts However sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen currently in AB X Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund For instance Tony Strickland has stated that only of the bonds or approximately billion should be issued Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday Additionally Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount B Lenders JP Morgan B Lehman Brothers B Bear Stearns M Tax Exempt Portion Of the B B is expected to be taxexempt Projected Interest Rate Taxable Rate TaxExempt Rate Current Projected Blended IR Maturity Date August For more details please contact me at Bill SB X Passed the Senate Yesterday but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB X yesterday which authorizes billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority The billion authorized under SB X is not the same as the billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward Again the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations Without the details of the longterm power contracts the governor has negotiated the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power Also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the California Public Power and Conservation Authority However this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August th however some decision will likely be made earlier According to sources the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal though SoCal has signed it The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash The second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB X bridge loan stating that the DWR would received of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount In other words the state will get paid before the utilities If this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments

begin to look at regional solutions Moreover the Administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan Something Less than Effective Price Caps From Daviss point of view the FERC plan has four major flaws The order applies only to California not to the rest of the west NonCalifornia generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California As the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage emergency and does not require any collusion Even when the price caps kick in they are based on the costplus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap The generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control If Davis doesnt sign on to the regional grid by June st then he will have to live with June nd headlines blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California could therefore pay as much as billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of PGE and SCE These sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the FERC andor the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about days One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for longterm power deals The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture The countrys largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PGE Meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the QFs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted If the QFs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the mw of gasfired QF capacity will remain offline Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for longterm contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the MOU for the SCE bailout plan The analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points For example one of the elements of the MOU is a nonbypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid This is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity This makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds According to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company For this and other reasons even if the Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose LongTerm Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to disclose the details of the longterm power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis Even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay

deal going through is a onetime quick vote if deal has t o go to hearings it will probably die If not transmission deal legislators will seize assets and seek price ca ps Asset seizure would target power contracts then power plants as a resul t the endless court battles will ensue but this gives Davis opportunity to continue to blame generators and marketers Bankruptcy for SoCal is still the most likely scenario with the QFs or SoCal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended Congressional democrats rally around Davis and seize opportunity to blame the Administration Transmission Deal and Democratic Support As Governor Gray Davis scrambles to build support for his SoCal Ed transmission proposal one thing is evident the longer the deal is exposed to public debate the less likely it is to pass In fact politicians have been so leery of the deal that Davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor to introduce the bill in the Senate In the eyes of many Democrati c legislators and all Republicans forcing SoCal Edison into bankruptcy is looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines that is wh y the Governors senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick up or down vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week The bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoi d debate however if there is an opening within the next two weeks and Davis feels he has enough support it will be pushed through Because the SoCal deal needs every piece in place as negotiated by Davis team the team wants no amendments allowed on the Assembly floor and a quick vote If thi s unlikely fast track strategy fails for Davis the prospects for the transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily keep in mind that th at it cannot even be resubmitted to the Assembly until it has been vetted by SoCal Edison attorneys According to sources the legislature is going to try to modify the Memorandum of Understanding between Gov Davis and SCE However the Senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to pass even a modified MOU Burton reportedly believes that at lea st Democrats will vote against it along with the Republicans The more that bill gets picked apart in public the uglier it looks and the more Democrat s will realize that they are all alone in supporting it Another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of SoCal and not the state Among other things the state is overpaying by about billion for the transmission lines Additionally the MOU Davis has with SoCal Ed nearly matches point for point the deal Davis condemned with PG E Asset Seizures Since before the PGE bankruptcy filing we have maintained that asset seizures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasing ly frustrated Democrats Davis legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law on eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across California to existing power contracts negotiated by whom Daviss calls profiteering power brokers Of course everyone in the Governors office understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal courts and would be a legal nightmare there are a few minor Constitutiona l legal and interstate commerce problems The main thing is that the seizing would continue Daviss main approach to this problem management by press conference and it would put the Governor and Democrats on the right side of the issue punishing the capitalist leeches According to one senior Democratic legislator there is movement within Democratic members of the state Assembly to demand that Davis agree to seize the power contracts in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase Of cours e taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking the power plants The appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would allegedly put California state officials in charge of where the power is sold and reduce markups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide spotmarket power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the pric e through the roof Price Caps One strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur depends powerfully on decisions made by the three Republican Governors from Colorado Alaska and Wyoming These three were the key players during the Portland Western Governors Conference last January and according to senio r White House officials it took the personal and prolonged intervention of President Bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous call for price caps from the governors If they had signed that price cap appeal the administration source said we would already have price caps So if they start to make it clear something has changed we will have to listen Sources indicate that if these Republican leaders begin to rethin k their opposition to price caps the Bush administration will be forced to reconsider price caps as a remedy for the West Cost Plus Caps Think of these as Republican price caps in that their fir st duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to provide power into the affected grid Just to give some idea of magnitudes in a cost plus deal current discussions would put a cap on power costs at something like per kilowatt hour That is a long way down from the August futures contract that is pricing in per kilowatt hour but a lo ng way above last Augusts kwhr price and a particularly long way above t he cost of generating this power which is something like kwh MarketPrice Exceptions The option allows the Bush administration to hav e political credit for imposing price caps As we write FERC is currently i n the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generating power in California Duke Dynegy AES Reliant and Williams The permit grants a further threeyear waiver that allows them to sell power into California in the existing whatever price the market will bear In other words FERC could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy at the market price perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market share and then power to control prices would revert back to FERC Technically in granting the extension of these permits FERC has to establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield mark et power that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding power at crucial times Of course FERC has just found on three different rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the subsequent price spikes But that would mean FERC would have to want to wie ld effective power over price capping in California and they have shown no desire on that front The escape clause for FERC simply to renew the waiver s is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than of an electricity market and none of these companies come close In other words the waivers option lets FERC escape if the Bush administration and FERC commissioners really want to escape Once again th at decision may be more in the hands of the three Republican Governors than anywhere else in the country But you can be certain that in the past few days Administration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabilities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plants Democrats Seize Opportunity to blame Bush Senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could come in as high as billion which would destroy state finances for a decade Add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear everyday about their own direct outofpocket electricity costs they paid billion for electricity in billion in and are expected to pa y billion this year ten times the rate two years ago Then of course they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredible numbers home in a very direct way and well who can blame the Democrats f or saying there is a simple solution but the White House wont allow it National level Democrats realize Californias power crisis is a prime opportunity to chastise the Bush administration and its freemarket advocat e FERC Chairman Hebert over their resistance to summer price caps As Californias leaders calculate this years taxpayer energy bill at potentially billion a rogues gallery of Democratic congressional leaders are currently meeting with Governor Davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across the eight western states of the power grid with a singular message the solution to all western voters electricity problems lies righ t in Washington DC at FERC headquarters controlled by Bush Administration appointees And as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its possible impact on control over the US Congress comes more into focus the solutions articulated by Californias Democrats who sense they have Republicans on the run in the West become less and less fr ee market focused The two strains of the Democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps

<7323034.1075843708365.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kristin.walsh@enron.com,2001-04-05 03:12:00,California Update Cc the transcript of an interview conducted yesterday with State Treasurer Phil Angelides Summary Bond Issuance to be B with year term tax exempt and nonexempt Angelides in favor of wind fall profit tax Opposed to current discussion between Davis and Socal in regards to Socal paying off the generators over years with a year grace period What decisions on rate components are necessary before you can sell bonds The big things we need are that the PUC must enter into agreement with DWR essentially warranting that sufficient revenues from rates will be availabl e for purchasing power It is really their job to define what each party need s to pay for power We need to give assurance to the investment community tha t whatever the overall rate is the state will get enough to pay its bonds However if the utilities challenge the decision it could stall the bond issuance What do you think will be the size of the first bond issue Based on what is currently possible and what the legislature has authorize d around bn The PUC has allowed us to sell north of bn but we anticipate that bn is absorbable Until the administration provides details for this office and the public on what its costs of buying power ar e and what it needs in terms of funding what will drive it is that number n ot what the PUC has said The issuance may well be a single bn issue or a series of smaller ones done together eg bn each weeks apart What is the total size of the market for CA taxexempt bonds What we do normally is bn in bonds for various revenues or general obligations In the CA infrastructure rate reductions bonds was a bn issuance and this was handled well This is not exclusively a CA market Around bn of these bonds is sold each year We anticipate that the bonds will be taxexempt and nonexempt What is the total of electric supply contracts that are firm enough to require funding We have estimates The DWR is buying power and lets say power costs and its portion of rates is This bond issuance covers the diff between and So the bond issuance is a way to cover the gap However if power prices do not come down you cannot keep borrowing If we issue more than bn in bonds I have to see the whole financial plan The implication is that he will not keep this plan secret What will be the term mix of the bond issues Overall term is expected to be in the year range I do not know the mix Do you have the ability to do bridging tax anticipation notes or anything like that to take care of the general fund The very purpose of the bridge loan is that we are taking a taxable and taxexempt bridge loan until bonds are issued In order for us to issue bonds a number of steps have to occur I would hope that the PUC and DWR d o what they have to do realistically by June Then the bond issuance would come semi allatonce In other words either all at once or something like billion every three weeks Are all of the general funds assets in cash or are some in the form of a less liquid receivable We have a lot of liquidity in real cash in general fund We have a cash flow We have the ability in pooled money investment accounts so that we ca n go out to five years We have bnplus in that account What is the minimum working capital required in the general fund for daytoday operations It depends and goes up and down On any given day we are doing on the order of mm There is a bn budget between the general funds and special fund Are you discussing the DWR contracting in relation to the required funding Do you have a veto on the deals struck This is all in the administrations court What we have asked for is t he information We have asked for this today by letter We have to move from working with or banks to a public offering which means public disclosure The general fund has been making advances to buy power but we want to get out of that business and to stop the bn plus drain on general fund from arranging an interim loan What is the credit risk from industry or other large users cherry picking o r selfselecting There are limits on the options out there ABX has limited the ability o f people to opt out of the system If you do allow them to opt out what do they have to pay to preserve the revenue stream The agreement between the DWR and the PUC will say that through a financing order we will get you t he revenue to service the bonds even if it adjusts rates This will be a covenant that the money will be made available If an initiative is launched could it create enough uncertainty to have an effect on ABIX or the bond issuance What about Harvey proofing W hat is the direct state participation The states role is infrastructure and economic development Bonds wil l be issued in name of DWR only to pay for power the state is buying not to rep ay utility deb I dont think the state will repay utility debt The stat e can buy power in or out of Chapter There will be no participation by the state bank I know Harvey well and he and I agree on a number of things For example I am cosponsoring the public power authority We should not pu t the state in the business of refinancing utility debt I dont think mo st consumer groups realize that we are selling bonds to pay for power I very much want and it is in my interest to repay the general fund At the sam e time that this office is financing the purchase of energy the fundamental problem is the price we are being charged by the generatorsthe ransom that is being demanded by the generators I agree with Harvey that as of this current time the generators are winning We will have to consider excess profits taxes or if the generators continue they have increased their prices tenfold The generators they bought a set of plants for bn Since January the state has spent over bn If the generators dont ta ke their foot off our throat they may leave us no option but to take back plants under emergency power So let them justify those rates What caus es the problem is the generators jacking up prices to the point where they wil l make us do something about it What is the measurable size premium that will have to be paid based on the most current estimates of bond issue size Measurable is the wrong choice of words We dont know how many basis points If it is more than bn we will begin to feel it Also I am not for that proposal to allow the utilities to pay off the generators over years with a year grace period They should work that out themselves not on the backs of ratepayers The perspective here is th at they did very very well in and They upstreamed billions

Kaminski Vince Milnthorp Rob Presto Kevin Ribeiro Claudio Shapiro Richard Steffes James Tawney Mark Tholan Scott Whitman Britt Subject California Update Importance High Executive Summary CPUC likely to pass rate hikes tomorrow politicians bowing to the inevitable Many questions still unanswered most notably sizestructure of rate increase and past utility debts Past undercollect major sticking point with little help available from transmission deal or longterm contracts Reliant seeking relief in circuit court from emergency orders large generators increasingly angry with Davis blame game QFs waiting for details of rate hike new price formula crucial to SoCals ability to make payments Bankruptcy outlook increasingly complex but debt rescheduling remains subject to failure In our late Friday report we wrote Davis could order rate hikes as a last ditch effort but this action would not address the undercollection issue There is still a high chance of bankruptcy by either the larger generators commercial paper holders and less now but still very possible the QFs as time is running out Events are unfolding exactly along these lines Why Rate Hikes Now CPUC President Lorretta Lynch came out this weekend in favor of rate hikes Davis and many legislators recognize that rate hikes are the quickest solution but that there is a potentially painful political price attached Davis will probably come out in support of a structured rate system passing on most of the hikes to business and industrial users Other California politicians are starting to face reality of rate hikes The CalEnergy ruling massively reduced their leverage over the creditors who are now able to sell outside the state if they can get similar relief from the courts And its not just the QFsthe giant Reliant Energy is appealing to the Ninth Circuit Court in San Francisco against Federal Judge Frank Damrells series of rulings forcing large generators to continue to sell to California What Impact Will the Rate Hikes Have Rate rises will stabilize the situation going forward but there will be a messy scramble to assign blame and liability for past debts Some form of rescheduling is a possibility but there are any number of accidents that could happen and yet result in bankruptcy for the utilities if they dont seek protection from creditors themselves UndercollectionNet Short Still Unaddressed All of these developments fail to address the past undercollection or the bond revenue plan Still the passage of rate hikes could speed up the legislature on these fronts as well The bulk of the rate hikes will go first to repay the DWR then to the commercial creditors Absent the transmission line deal the bond revenue plan would have to be restructured to repay the past undercollect Longterm power contracts are still relatively meaningless until when the majority of the contracts kick in Large Power Suppliers Losing Patience Relations are also deteriorating between Davis and the large power suppliers Davis for the most part has been very careful to cultivate them during the drawn out negotiations talking to several of the main CEOs almost daily But state legislators and officials are rapidly trying to initiate investigations of alleged market manipulation and overcharging to deflect the growing political heat from themselves This is only agitating the larger generators more as every day passes If Reliant loses their case it may also tempt some of the larger generators to force the issue to bankruptcy Whats more financial creditors are also waiting with growing impatience and the utilities themselves are contemplating voluntary bankruptcy PGE in particular simply will not agree to Davis transmission lines deal as it stands and a bankruptcy workout may offer the best albeit uncertain chance of a return to eventual health someday QFs Listening and Waiting But the largest threat as we have been saying is not from the major energy companies It is the small companies known as QFs that will be the triggers if bankruptcy occurs Remember these two facts The QFs are a diverse group of companies and it only takes three of them to force bankruptcy and many of them have to move in court quickly or lose any possible standing for future court action It is in the interests of a number of creditors to wait and hope that a negotiated settlement can be reached but others have a large incentive to game the situation and threaten to force bankruptcy Other bullish news PGE gets extended forbearance until April th from its banks and SoCal announces that it will pay some QFs The actual amount of payments to the QFs is still subject to the CPUC approving a revised pricing formula that is satisfactory to the QFs That decision should come tomorrow Outlook Last week we wrote that the QFs felt there was no point in filing today because they want to see what they can get from the legislature this week and in all likelihood what they can get from the CPUC hearing next week The next hours will be crucial Only massive rate hikes or higher roughly would address the undercollect issue and Davis is unlikely to authorize those As one source told us the age of denial is mostly coming to an end and that is the main source of hope that California can begin to move forward from this But the situation is so complex and there are so many players and angles involved that a negotiated solution to the past debt problem will still be complicated and vulnerable to failure
