BPA reached an ag reement on a fiveyear power delivery deal that has been the source of conf lict between the two parties for almost a year Kaiser Aluminum closed its smelting operations in the Pacific Northwest in late choosing to rese ll contracted power from the BPA on the spot market According to the Spoke sman Review Kaiser netted more than million from the sales Other a luminum companies reselling power from BPA reached agreements during spring with Bonneville Under these agreements the companies agreed to keep smelters off line to keep power supplies ample in the region and BPA agre ed in return to give the smelters when they restarted operations a per megawatthour MWh credit for obtaining power from sources other than BPA Months of wrangling produced a contract between Kaiser and the BPA tha t negates a takeorpay clause that would require Kaiser to pay for the f ederal power whether used or not BPA said Under the agreement signed tod ay Kaiser will avoid the possibility of paying damages if it does not take all the power under the contractAnd if BPA cant resell it we are no t going to hold Kaiser liable for the difference Clearing Up reported As a concession for the elimination of the takeorpay clause Kaiser wil l receive interruptible service from the BPA on some of its MW load Ka iser received criticism from union groups who claimed that the company was using the money it had gained reselling power to pay down longterm debt rebuild a refinery in Louisiana and reward executives with excessive bonuse s rather than splitting the money

Orange County Register consumer groups b usinesses and the legislature have questioned the recent actions of the po wer authority which has vowed to secure nearly megawatts MW of pow er by summer to avoid power shortages The power authority which was created by Governor Gray Davis and the state Legislature in May can i ssue up to billion in bonds to bolster the states power supply through financing new renewable generation or peaker projects The Register said th at businesses and consumer groups are worried that higher electricity rates could be the result of the power authority

filed more than seven days after July ended were untimely andneither company supported in detail its actual costs for its transact ions according to the document Reliants filing was not consistent with the requirements of the June Order and Willams did not provide any c ost support for its transactions beyond restating general objections to the commissions pricing methodology the commissioners
