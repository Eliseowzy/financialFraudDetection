have your profile updated Ill fax it in for you If the information changes in the future ie credit card I can go in and change it Since Im now your local travel agent this will assist me in booking further reservations through the ClickTrip program slb Original Message From Lee Ann Hinson ENRON Sent Wednesday January PM To Lee Ann Hinson Subject Travel Services While recent events have dramatically impacted Enrons travel volume Alliance Worldwide formerly Travel Agency in the Park wanted to contact you regarding the Enron Travel Program Since our company has been a strategic business partner with Enron and has provided a complete scope of services from booking ticketing ticket delivery customer service reporting management of ClickTrip to facilitating preferred vendor arrangements with airlines to benefit Enron These services have been provided on a management fee basis from Alliance to Enron As of December the management fee has been suspended during Enrons period of reorganization We are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to Enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing fee per ticket To provide you with a brief history of our arrangement Enron and Alliance approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront discounts for Enrons business travel These discounts are available only through Alliance and are given at time of ticketing All commissions were stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to Enron in exchange for Enron paying Alliance a contracted management fee This management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each Enron cost center based on the total number of transactions This travel program provided Enron over million in airline savings on million spent in the year and over million on million spent for the first quarters of These savings are after the payment of the travel agency management fee The effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by the airlines cannot yet be determined We have contacted the airline companies and most of Enrons preferred carriers have agreed to extend the contracts through April You may utilize these discounts through Alliance by calling or In March Enron and Alliance will begin evaluating Enrons volume and travel patterns and determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure As mentioned earlier Alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in lieu of a management fee These fees are reimbursable to Enron employees through normal expense report procedures Specifically the new fee structure is based on zerocommission contracts for tickets purchased from Enrons preferred carriers The fee schedule for all airline tickets for Enron travel is as follows Domestic tickets with or without upfront discount International tickets without upfront discount of Savings capped at International tickets with upfront discount Southwest Airlines and ClickTrip Reservations HotelCar Only Bookings The savings to Enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees that are charged For example Enrons average ticket prices are domestic and international after discounts Enrons average savings are domestic and international before fees The savings are more than three times the per ticket fee If you are accustomed to booking your own travel online you may continue to do so by booking through ClickTrip ClickTrip is the only online booking tool that allows access to Enrons negotiated discounts Ticketing through ClickTrip also bears a smaller fee of if no agent assistance is necessary There is no charge to look at schedules ClickTrip is available hours a day and may be accessed through Enrons intranet site or via the Internet site enron ClickTrip is also a useful tool for checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status To check upgrade status or to review a ticketed itinerary simply click the Check My Trip button
