by Matthias LeeSINECT on PM From Britt NRON on AM To Matthias CT cc Alan CT Harry M CT Richard B CT Linda R CT Brenda NRON Deborah nron Subject In re MV PACIFIC VIRGO PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt it was a pleasure speaking with you this evening your time As I mentioned I have some followup fact questions that I would appreciate your help with when you have a moment Some of these questions probably require the attention of experts eg s and so feel free to decline to answer where the question appears outside your jurisdiction Please do not call anyone outside of Enron to get answers at this point also to the extent that you need to ask Enron employees for answers I would prefer your asking them questions and writing down the answers to be kept in your investigation file rather sending them this email and getting email responses A chronology sent by you as an attachment to your letter of July to Mike Robison reflects that on November a sample of Elang Condensate was taken by SGS Redwood Singapore Apparently the Filterable Dirt was off spec versus a max of With regard to this sampling a Did Enron request it YES If so who requested it JOHN CHISMARERIC TANand for what purposePRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF SUITABILITY OF ELANG CONDENSATE BEFORE PURCHASE b Was the sample taken from one of the shore tanks from which the cargo at issue was loaded If not from what location was the sample obtained SAMPLE WAS TAKEN FROM A FLOATING FACILITY NOT SHORETANK UNCLEAR WHETHER FROM SAME TANK AS LOADED CARGO LOADED CARGO LIKELY TO HAVE COME FROM A FEW TANKS c Did the testing reveal that anything else that has us concerned about the present cargo such as the presence of metals NO d Did Enron do any followup with Phillips who I understand was the supplier about the offspec dirt or anything else that was discovered during the sampling If so please give the particulars as to who was involved what was said and what the result was NOT SURE IF JOHN CHISMAR SPOKE WITH PHILLIPS BUT NOTE THAT CARGO WAS NOT BOUGHT WITH GUARANTEED FGH TYPE SPECS BUT NORMAL EXPORT QUALITY AT THE TIME AND PLACE OF LOADING e Has the sample been retained NOVEMBER SAMPLE ALL USED UP AT TESTING Did Enron discuss with the supplier athe proposed end use of this product b its fitness for that end use andor c the contract specs that Enron had to meet to satisfy FGH If not why not JOHN CHISMARS INPUT REQUIRED Another chronology prepared by you mentions that a loadport analysis was performed by SGS on June and that our cargo met the FGH contract specs I assume in all regards YES ASHING METHOD USED Do we still have that sample available for retesting and will a restest of it be included in the current round of testing THE SAMPLES WERE DRAWN AT LOADPORT FROM AN AUTOSAMPLER XL SAMPLES WERE USED UP AT THE JUNE TEST WE PRESENTLY HAVE A XL LOADPORT SAMPLE FROM THE AUTOSAMPLER IN SINGAPORE RESERVED FOR JOINT TESTING AND ANALYSIS IN SINGAPORE THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER XL LOADPORT SAMPLE FROM THE AUTOSAMPLER IN OWNERSPI CLUB POSSESSION WHICH WE HAVE ASKED TO BE SURRENDERED TO US TO BE DELIVERED TO SINGAPORE WHERE ALL SAMPLES ARE BEING COLLATED FOR JOINT TESTING AND ANALYSIS Why is this product called Elang Crude when it is in reality reportedly condensate CARGO CALLED CRUDE BY SUPPLIER APPARENTLY BECAUSE OF EXPORT REASONS HAVE TO CHECK WITH JOHN CHISMAR UNDERSTAND FROM SPEAKING WITH PACMARINE THAT AN ULTRALIGHT CRUDE LIKE ELANG CAN GENERALLY BE REFERRED TO AS CONDENSATE BUT THERE IS NO REAL BENCHMARK AS TO HOW LIGHT A CRUDE MUST BE BEFORE IT CAN RIGHTLY BE REGARDED AS CONDENSATE What is the meaning of the term export grade Are there various other gradations If so what do those mean JOHN CHISMARS INPUT REQUIRED Has Enron ever purchased Elang Crude from this supplier previously NO Ever heard of any prior problems with Elang Crude from this supplier NO NOTE THAT CONDENSATE IS TYPICALLY DELIVERED TO REFINERIES NOT POWER PLANTS THAT ARE NOT TOO CONCERNED WITH DETAILED SPECS Has Enron ever chartered the PACIFIC VIRGO in the past to transport Elang Crude NOIf so please give a thumbnail description of the voyages If not have we ever chartered the PACIFIC VIRGO at allNO Prior to this voyage have our operations folks ever chartered any vessel to transport a cargo of Elang CrudeNO HOWEVER WE MADE DELIVERIES OF SENIPAH CONDENSATE FROM INDONESIA ONE IN FEB AND ANOTHER IN MAY UNDER THE FGH CONTRACT If so please give a thumbnail description of the voyages including a whether the tanks were Butterworthed SENIPAH CARGO NOT BUTTERWORTHED BUT INSTRUCTIONS WERE GIVEN TO TANK CLEAN PRIMARILY BECAUSE LAST CARGOES WERE CARBON BLACK FEEDSTOCK MAY AND FUELOIL FEB TANK CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED WASHING AND FLUSHING TANKS PIPES AND PUMPS and if so whether Enron had to pay extra WE DID NOT HAVE TO PAY EXTRA ON BOTH OCCASIONS IT IS ONLY IN THE CP OF PACIFIC VIRGO THAT WE AGREED TO BEAR COSTS FOR CLEANING b whether the end use of the Elang Crude was similar to the end use of the cargo here BOTH SENIPAH CONDENSATE CARGOES WERE FOR FGH and c whether there were any contamination problemsconcerns NO NOTE HOWEVER THAT ASHING METHOD WAS USED BY SGS ON BOTH FEB AND MAY SENIPAH CARGOES Who were the Enron ops personnel who negotiated the Butterrworth issue with the owners ERIC TAN If there are written documents memorializing this including letters telexes telefaxes emails taped or recorded telephone messages calendar entries or diary entries they need to be preserved I wonder if I could put you in charge of making sure that all files relevant to this voyage generally are carefully preserved for possible use as evidence later on One thing we dont want to happen is to face a spurious charge of spoliation of evidence because an allegedly important document or memo from our files is inadvertantly lost or destroyed The Watson Farley letter opinion of July notes that the BL identified the actual owners as the carriers rather than Mitsubishi who I understand was probably a timecharterer THE BROKER HAS CONFIRMED MITSUBISHI CORP TO BE THE TIME CHARTERER The copies of the BL that I have seen however reflect a blank space in the form underneath the word CARRIER Do you have access to a BL that mentions the name of the actual owner NO Perhaps Watson Farley meant that because Barwil Agencies signed on behalf of the master that the true owner was bound although I am just guessing MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE SAME The PacMarine report dated July ascribes the cause of the contamination to a accumulation of excessive sediments in the ships cargo tanks especially clinkage and b the cleansing properties of condensate Although the author refrains from squarely linking the excessive sediments to prior inadequate tank cleaning he clearly leans in that direction On the other hand it is not clear from the report whether adequate tank cleaning under the circumstances required Butterworthing I SPOKE WITH PACMARINE CAPT SAWANT HIS OPINION IS THAT BUTTERWORTHING OR USING THE VESSELS ON BOARD EQUIPMENT TO RINSE AND FLUSH TANKS PIPES AND PUMPS WITH FRESHWATER WOULD HAVE BEEN ADEQUATE CLEANING a Were our ops people aware of the prior cargoes WE WERE AWARE OF THE LAST CARGOESand the methods used to clean the tanks WE WERE AWARE THAT NO TANK CLEANING WAS DONE PRIOR TO LOADING THE LAST CARGO andor the cleansing property of condensates YES BUT THE ASSUMPTION MADE WAS THE PREVIOUS CARGO OF COSSACK CRUDE WITH SIMILAR PROPERTIES WOULD HAVE CLEANED THE TANK AND THE VESSEL BEING YOUNG WOULD NOT HAVE A LOT OF CLINKAGE I get the impression from your Issue for Consideration that the answer to the prior cargoes part of this question is yes b Was it within the scope of SGSs duties to advise Enron of the foregoing NO I WOULD NEED EXPERT SUPPORT ON WHETHER IT IS OWNER OR CHARTERERS DUTY TO KNOW SUITABLE TANK CLEANING METHOD or were they only supposed to issue a Dry Certificate c Did we have anyone else attend the ship at loading on our behalf besides SGS NO I know this covers a lot of information none of it is urgent Next week will be fine for a response Many thanks for your help BKD

<6118261.1075860510537.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,matthias.lee@enron.com,1999-10-01 12:17:00,Fw pacific valor Cc I spoke with Stuart Bland a short while ago He instructs that ECTS would like to commence an action against the vessel owners Stuart who was also speaking for John Nowlan wants to arrest the vessel as it arrives in Kuantan West Malaysia to discharge the PX which was to be supplied to ECTS According to Russells calculations below the vessel is due to arrive in Kuantan on or about October The objective is to arrest the vessel while it still has the cargo for the highest nuisance value Since we may be at the brink of commencing action below is a quick status update also for the easy reference of Richard who reads this in copy Cause of Action and Damages As advised by WFW ECTS only has one cause of action against the vessel owners ie failing in their duty to reasonably despatch the vessel to arrive within ETA The cause of action is highly dependant on fact Although we have some evidence that suggest that the initial ETA Daesan of under the charterparty may not have been realistic we still do not have all the facts as to why the vessel was delayed in the preceding port in Yantai China We were told by the vessel owners that the delay was due to the preceding charterers not having the necessary import licence ready which if true works in favour of the charterers As advised by WFW the quantum of damages recoverable remains an issue ECTS is likely to be able to recover the difference in freight about USD but the difference in price of the PX about USD is less certain as the question of remoteness is again fact dependant Suzanne advises that the cases have not always been consistent Winning the case therefore is not a sure thing The above has been communicated to Russell as the matter developed as well as John and Stuart over the phone Arresting the vessel I took Suzanne Bainbridges and Neale Gregsons advice over the phone earlier this evening I am also scheduled to meet with Neale on Monday Oct or with both Neale and Suzanne on Tues Oct depending on Russell going through his tapes I anticipate the meeting to be more likely Monday than Tuesday As advised it is possible to arrest the vessel in Kuantan before the formal commencement of arbitration proceedings For an arrest in Kuantan arrest papers will have to be prepared by Malaysian lawyers There is no need to quantify the claim for the arrest papers under Singapore and English law but can only assume that the same is true under Malaysian law which for most part follow English law The arrest papers have to be endorsed by a Kuantan judge Under English and Singapore law and presumably Malaysian law the cargo owners would have a prima facie case against the arresting party for interfering with the sale and purchase contract However as ECTS has a prima facie case for arrest The arrest would therefore not be wrongful and ECTS would not likely be liable to the cargo owners in that respect The cost for arrest proceedings alone in Singapore are typically around SGD and is likely to be the same in Malaysia However Kuantan is apparently a notoriously difficult place to arrest a vessel because the judge is not usually accomodating and not well versed in admiralty law It was initially thought by Russell and Stuart that the vessel would be in Kuantan over the weekend Russell has since confirmed that that is not the case This is fortunate because Neale advises that there would have been almost no chance of getting an order from the Kuantan judge over the weekend Regards

PRODUCT Matt Thanks for the headsup on this issue I will confer with Janice and one of us will get back to you Meanwhile I think I may need further clarification about what testing methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines My key area of concern is whether as now appears unlikely from your email SGS tested using both ASTM D without ashing and ASTM D with ashing at all the relevant points and whether the test results were consistent eg whether the product was onspec for both methods immediately before loading but offspec for both methods at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines May I impose on you to provide one summary chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports with particular emphasis on a whether both testing methods ASTM D without ashing and with ashing were used and the results and b the results for filterable dirt You have just sent something like this for the Thailand cargo only which I found very helpful Also if SGS or anyone else has made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt analysis or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo please let me know about that as well I appreciate your good help Britt Matthias CT AM To Janice R CT Britt NRON cc Alan CT Harry M CT Angeline CT Subject D Dear Janice Britt I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and coordinate with Mike Browns team and myself in regard to the D issue whilst I am to look to Britts guidance for the contamination on the Elang cargo My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this email The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end next week The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt so we would need to decide in quite short order on the test method we want to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by the level of filterable dirt the metals clearly would also be an important factor As you may be aware the loadport sample results which we are presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded was tested with ashing for metals We would not be able to say whether another loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D If it doesnt test on spec at the joint testing using straight D the vessel owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First Gas anyway independent of the filterable dirt Although such as argument may not defeat our case entirely it is very likely to impact on the quantum we would be able to recover It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would therefore be ashing to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample results We still have SGSs support for that but we need to convince Minton Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the OwnersPI Club Still just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to Firts Gas we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method acceptable to parties whether D or ashing or some other method That said I think if we are able to go with ashing for the joint testing it is not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas I note Janices preference for US experts over European experts for the D issue Have we been able to get any US experts view on the right test to use whether D or ashing Has Enron formed a view on the correct test method If we have been able to source a friendly US expert we may want to have his input for the contamination issue Your views and guidance would be most appreciated Thanks and regards Matt I also note Janices preference to source for US experts to assist us on the D issue over European experts and was wondering whether we have been able to for

Samples for Testing PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt Subject to the views of Jim Studdert and David Best given that we already put underwriters on notice that there was contamination and given that we have worked closely with Mintons underwriters representatives I would assume that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a total quantum before the joint survey takes place in fact it looks like the final determination of ECTs total quantum of damages may be impacted by the results of the joint survey although I would not necessarily want to say that to underwriters at this point My preliminary review of the policy reflects no language in the policy which would require ECT to immediately provide a total quantum The policy specifically requires under INSTRUCTIONS IN CASE OF LOSS that ECT file a claim in writing against the delivering carrier holding him responsible as soon as loss or damage is discovered even though the full exent thereof is not apparent details can be furnished later Such action will not prejudice your insurance claim Let me know if you would like a copy of the pertinent policy I have

Rich Slovenski regarding the Elang presently stored in Thailand He confirms that the intention was to deliver it to First Gas some time end Augustearly September premised on delivery and acceptance of the first Elang cargo and subject to First Gass consumption Cargo still not sold Rich is not immediately able to calculate loss on the cargo basis First Gas Price vs resale price but will be giving it somethought to arrive at an estimate The test results we have to date of the Thai cargo are somewhat inconclusive but indicate Lead and Vanadium may be off spec but principal reason for not delivering to First Gas is uncertainty of D as a test method Summary of Thailand samples test results July Ship Composite sample taken before discharge in Thailand was tested by SGS Thailand for Carbon Residue

dd rd August to Eric from cargo Interests viewpoint it is usually best in these circumstances to keep as many analytical options open as possible Certainly sufficient to enable the best chance of establishing the cause To that end I would recommend that you provide the other Parties with the test methods ASTM Dnumbers and state that these tests will be applied to retain samples from each of Pacific Virgo before after loading Australia all cargo Pacific Virgo before discharge Thailand Batangasnominated tanks if samples available Pacific Virgo before discharge Thailand Thainominated tanks Pacific Virgo on arrival Batangas the samples upon which First Gas based their rejection Pacific Virgo prior departure from Batangas including bottom samples Pacific Virgo prior discharge Korea including bottom samples Pacific Virgo any other samples that are available and that might progress the investigation Some testing may involve composites some individual samples This will to a degree depend on the labs ability to get any particulates into homogeneous suspension and keep them there long enough to make a composite If that cant be done it will have to be individuals Insofar as identifying the particulates should this prove necessary I think we need to keep all options open While it is always possible to perform unilateral analysis should disagreements arise better to keep the Parties together if possible But not at the expense of limiting the analysis ability to determine cause I apologise if this all seems a bit woolly But if you limit at the beginning the potential extent of testing that might be necessary it can all prove meaningless I appreciate that testing cost plays a role in all of this It is in noones interest to do testing just for the sake of it and as far as I am concerned that is not on my agenda nor I am sure is it on Enrons But we must be realistic Depending upon the size of your potential claim have Underwriters been put on notice yet by the way it might be worth spending several K to get to the root of the matter rather than less to learn nothing Best regards Cliff Bennett Minton Treharne Davies S Pte Ltd Original Message From Matthias Lee To Cc Eric Tan Angeline Poon Date Monday August PM Subject Re Pacific Virgo Elang Crude Samples for Testing Dear Cliff Would you be able to draw up a test programme based on your recommendations below with the view to circulate it to all parties including SGS for their agreement prior to joint testing I think such a preagreed programme would be most useful and would avoid any dispute on testing procedure subsequently Eric expects all the samples to arrive in Singapore within the next couple of days and send out the notice to all parties to attend joint testing sometime between August Thanks and best regards Matt Lee Forwarded by Eric TanSINECT on clifford bennett on To Eric Tan cc Subject Re Pacific Virgo Elang Crude Samples for Testing Eric My recommendations concerning joint testing are as follows Samples Ideally at least one set of sealed integrity traceable chain of custody samples from each stage of the shipment should be available at the joint testing The samples will be checked against the appropriate sampling records prior to testing If possible I think we should have samples from Loading Australia one set Pacific Virgos tanks after loading Discharge Thailand one set predischarge vessels tanks Thai parcel if the other Batangas tanks were sampled at this time these samples should be included Batangas one set vessels tanks on arrival plus one set vessels tanks from the most recent sampling before the vessel departed Batangas to include dead bottom samples Korea one set predischarge vessels tanks on arrival including any dead bottom samples Depending on exactly what samples are available testing may encompass both composites and in some cases individual tank samples where particulates are involved the composition of individual tank samples even in a laboratory can destroy the representivity of a sample This by the way is the reason for my concerns over sample decanting in Philippines evidence can be lost Testing I would suggest the laboratory of SGS Singapore because that is where the samples are being collated Provided the testing can be done to the appropriate standard and the methods are available any laboratory would do As advised previously the laboratory tests and the witnesses are there to ensure among other things that all is above board Test schedule As advised previously the basic methods I would recommend are Carbon residue ASTM D Carbon residue bottoms ASTM D Ash ASTM D BSW ASTM D V Na K Ca Pb ASTM D Filterable dirt ASTM D Please note that for filterable dirt ASTM D is not applicable as it is designed for insitu line samples ASTM D is a laboratory method that is essentially equivalent Both methods are intended for particulates in aviation fuels Anyway SGS Singapore can run ASTM D The above suite of tests should be run on all selected samples it will almost certainly not be necessary to test all available samples in duplicate Duplicates are necessary because standalone results are always open to doubt In any event duplicates are often a requirement of the test method and any reputable laboratory will run duplicates as a matter of course Duplicate samples should not mean twice the price Investigative testing This is more difficult to predict in terms of exactly what will be necessary To a degree it will be guided by what is found in the above spec testing My initial recommendation would be to check the solubility of the particulates particularly in aromatic solvent to check if organic and possibly in acid to check if inorganic If as has so far been reported the particulates are not aromatic solvent soluble and because they do not appear to contribute to the ash content of the fuel a best guess might be that they are carbon particles However we need to keep an open mind on this We might need to think about microscopy visible or electron on the particles Possibly also look at elemental analysis of the particles by eg energy dispersive Xray analysis I will give some further thought to what might be required by way of investigative analysis and revert At this stage I suggest that all options on the investigative side are kept open OwnersPI might not agree but realistically we cannot predict what we will find or what might need to be done until we start getting some spec test results and some simple particle solubilities done I trust this helps Please keep me advised regarding samplesjoint test matters Best regards Cliff Bennett Minton Treharne Davies S Pte Ltd Original Message From Eric Tan To Clifford Bennett Cc Richard Slovenski Matthias Lee Angeline

VIRGO PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt Im on the same page as Janice with regard to testing although Id like to spin out my thoughts a bit In my view at the end of the day it is virtually inevitable that both D with ashing and D without ashing are going to be used on the critical loadport sample and therefore for the rest of the samples as well at the joint analysis Mitsubishis strategy at the joint analysis will be to get the remaining loadport sample to come up offspec on retesting for obvious reasons Prior to the joint analysis Mitsubishi will be aware that a D without ashing is in the FGH contract and that b ECT believes D without ashing may have a reproducibility issue with this type of product Given this if ECT proposes to use only D with ashing our safest bet on the loadport sample at the joint analysis Mitsubishi will smell a rat and insist on D without ashing The same would apply I think if even if ECT proposed to use only D without ashing as its sole test at the joint analysis The more different kinds of tests Mitsubishi can forcefully argue should be run the more likely it is that one of them will show the loadport sample is offspec Mitsubishis goal will be supported by the general practice of the chemists involved who will want to rerun every test previously run in order to get to the bottom of this My sense is that it would be very difficult under the circumstances for ECT to credibly take the position that only one test or the other D with ashing or D without ashing should be run in fact in light of what I believe is virtually inevitable Mitsubishi insisting on whatever test we dont propose and in order to keep from appearing to be overly concerned about the reproducibility problem my feeling is that we may want to go ahead and propose both tests to Mitsubishi assuming that it is expected that we would initially propose the proper tests to Mitsubishi and not the other way around Can you let us know exactly who will be doing the handson testing of this product in Singapore I know that we nominated SGS Singapore but does this necessarily mean that someone from SGS will be doing the actual work as opposed to us just using SGSs lab As Janice pointed out we need to make absolutely sure that a the lab is firstclass and b whoever performs the test this time is very experienced with D with and without ashing Also it is my thought that we do not want anyone from SGS there who is aware of the presale analysis that SGS did of the Elang Crude cargo This latter point especially needs to be handled with great care if there is a need to communicate with SGS about any of this I would suggest that you first confer with David or Neal Many thanks for your help Britt Again many thanks for your

AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt I agree w Britt that we need to know more about what testing has been done but I would think that the joint test should be conducted using the same method used at loadport regardless of whether ashing is proper or not Not for the reason you mention Mitsubishi may well argue about proper rejection but thats not likely a viable argument since the fact is that First Gas rejected the cargo and the dirt spec alone was sufficient grounds for that rejection but for the sake of consistency It doesnt matter at all to First Gas what test methods were used or will be used on this cargo its no longer any of their concern Its Enrons risk and sole responsibility to deal w costs following rejection per the contract I hope that we are not informing First Gas about anything that has happened or will happen on this cargo I noticed a note from Jon Russell inquiring about the cargo I trust that we have politely refused to tell them anything Regards Janice EB Assistant General Counsel Enron North America Corp Fax Britt NRON AM To Matthias CT cc Janice R CT Alan CT Harry M CT Richard B CT Michael A CT Deborah nron Subject Re DIn re MV PACIFIC VIRGO PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt Thanks for the headsup on this issue I will confer with Janice and one of us will get back to you Meanwhile I think I may need further clarification about what testing methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines My key area of concern is whether as now appears unlikely from your email SGS tested using both ASTM D without ashing and ASTM D with ashing at all the relevant points and whether the test results were consistent eg whether the product was onspec for both methods immediately before loading but offspec for both methods at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines May I impose on you to provide one summary chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports with particular emphasis on a whether both testing methods ASTM D without ashing and with ashing were used and the results and b the results for filterable dirt You have just sent something like this for the Thailand cargo only which I found very helpful Also if SGS or anyone else has made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt analysis or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo please let me know about that as well I appreciate your good help Britt Matthias CT AM To Janice R CT Britt NRON cc Alan CT Harry M CT Angeline CT Subject D Dear Janice Britt I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and coordinate with Mike Browns team and myself in regard to the D issue whilst I am to look to Britts guidance for the contamination on the Elang cargo My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this email The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end next week The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt so we would need to decide in quite short order on the test method we want to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by the level of filterable dirt the metals clearly would also be an important factor As you may be aware the loadport sample results which we are presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded was tested with ashing for metals We would not be able to say whether another loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D If it doesnt test on spec at the joint testing using straight D the vessel owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First Gas anyway independent of the filterable dirt Although such as argument may not defeat our case entirely it is very likely to impact on the quantum we would be able to recover It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would therefore be ashing to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample results We still have SGSs support for that but we need to convince Minton Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the OwnersPI Club Still just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to Firts Gas we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method acceptable to parties whether D or ashing or some other method That said I think if we are able to go with ashing for the joint testing it is not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas I note Janices preference for US experts over European experts for the D issue Have we been able to get any US experts view on the right test to use whether D or ashing Has Enron formed a view on the correct test method If we have been able to source a friendly US expert we may want to have his input for the contamination issue Your views and guidance would be most appreciated Thanks and regards Matt I also note Janices preference to source for US experts to assist us on the D issue over European experts and was wondering whether we have been able to for

CT Matthias CT cc Deborah nron Brenda NRON Subject In re MV PACIFIC VIRGO PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Heres an update Matt if any of this appears inaccurate to you dont hesitate to point it out The pending joint survey a The joint survey has yet to be scheduled The reason for the delay is an issue concerning whether SGSs Singapore laboratory has the resourcescompetence to carry out the joint analysis Steve Jones ECTs choice of chemist is communicating with SGS in order to make this determination Although this has delayed scheduling the joint testing Jones feels strongly that it will be most costeffective for ECT to proceed with a joint analysis only after making this determination I and Matt have personally spoken with Jones about this and believe he understands that ECT is looking for the quickest most costeffective resolution to this dispute with Mitsubishi Because of the issue with SGS Jones has waited until now to send the proposed testing program to Technichem Mitsubishis choice of surveyorchemist in a previous report I mentioned that the testing program had already been sent to Technichem this now turns out not to be the case By today Jones should have sent the proposed testing program to Technichem in order to get the ball rolling and with the expectation that Technichem will have comments that will require time to incorporate b If things go well with SGS Jones anticipates scheduling a joint analysis about twothree weeks from now Jones plan to personally attend the joint survey on our behalf given the complexity of the testing methods Even after that testing Jones anticipates the possibility of further testing in England using highly specialized equipment to determine whether the apparent filterable dirt buildup was caused by a malfunction of the vessels inert gas system Costs a Surveyorschemists Jones advises that to date he and his firm have spent a total of about days at pounds per day for a total of approximately pounds or roughly at the current USDpounds exchange rate of pound Jones has subcontracted some of his work to Allen Goddard now with ITSCaleb Brett who specializes in the type of testing at issue Jones estimates that Goddard has spent approximately one day on this matter at a daily rate of lbs or Jones estimates that from this point until the actual joint survey begins he will spend about two more days and Goddard will spend about another onehalf day This totals about pounds or For the actual joint testing Jones estimates that he will spend about twelve days straight including transit time Goddard would not attend but would be available by telephone if Jones had a question Twelve days time amounts to pounds or not including aire fare room and board Afterwards for the additional testing in England to determine whether the inert gas system caused the buildup in filterable dirt Jones estimates another pounds for the cost of the lab he does not know at this point whether he would attend the entire testing procedure which he believes could be completed in about two days If he attended both days this additional testing in England would run to another pounds or b Other experts SGS and Caleb Bretts costs to date are being compiled by Matt SGS will spend another SGD purchasing the necessary chemicals for the joint testing and bill for another SGD for prejointanalysis development work basically practicing on extra samples from the PACIFIC VIRGO This comes to a total of SGD or about to prepare for the joint analysis based on the current reported SGDUSD exchange rate of SGS estimates that it will bill us for the joint analysis SGD or about Captain Sawant of PacMarine one of our ship operations experts will be charging us SGD or about for work done to date which should be largely concluded with the finalization of his report Captain Gregory of Noble Denton the ship operation expert we would probably use for testifying has been asked to do no work on this matter at this time c Attorneys David Best is out of town on vacation but his office advises that his time and expenses to date amounts to approximately pounds or about This is subject to being adjusted up or down once Best gets back in the office and has time to review the bill I imagine that this bill does not include the time incurred by a barrister that Best called for advice on the FGH issue Neither Best nor anyone from his firm will need to attend the joint testing Neale Gregsons firm Watson Farley has incurred fees and expense to date of SGD or about Matt has not yet seen an itemized bill for this time but feels that while it is high it is not unexpected given the timeintensive nature of this matter Matt will be asking Gregson whether the time also includes time spent on the FGH matter My and my legal assistants fee and expenses through today amount to approximately This also includes time spent on the FGH matter although pursuant to Alans instructions I am no longer spending time on that matter except where necessary to keep Janice Moore apprised d Summary of Costs In sum no less than approximately has been spent to date and this figure will increase once I get the SGS and Caleb Brett costs to date and once David Best comes back from vacation on September and reviews his bill although these figures probably include a heavy overlap of time spent on the FGH matter Another will be necessary to get ready for the joint analysis another to perform the joint analysis in Singapore and another approximately to perform specialized testing in London after the joint analysis is done if Steve Jones determines that such further testing is necessary Recent Sale of Thailand cargo a You will recall that the bulk of the product from the MV PACIFIC VIRGO was discharged in to shore tanks in Thailand and has not been tendered to FGH given the problems with the product discharged later in the Phillipines which was tendered to FGH who rejected it Samples from the shore tanks in Thailand have recently been tested by SGSs laboratory in the US and reportedly found on spec All of the Thailand product has recently been sold to Caltex Singapore for delivery September reportedly for use in Caltexs refinery which makes the risk of rejection of that product by Caltex very low b Unfortunately Matt advises that the trader cannot give us even a ballpark figure for the sales price of the Thailand product until the end of the month given that the price is tied to some market index Lacking this it is difficult to estimate what total diminution in market value of the Elang crude ECT has sustained until then We were previously told that the product discharged in Singapore sustained a diminution in market value of about For my own purposes based on nothing more than speculation and given that the bulk of the cargo was discharged in Thailand I am using the working hypothesis that ECTs total damages for diminution of market value of all the product discharged from the MV PACIFIC VIRGO is in the range of Again this may later turn out to be very inaccurate Expert witness supplemental opinion At my request Captain Sawant our consulting expert on ship operations was asked whether he believed that ECTs instructions to the ship regarding tank washing would have been sufficient to prevent the type of contamination that occurred had such instructions been properly carried out ie if the ship had access to fresh water Captain Sawant has opined that he does not believe such instructions were sufficient to have prevented the type of contamination that occurred While we can protect Captain Sawants opinion from discovery by using him only as a consulting expert it strikes me that Mitsubishi will likely not overlook this issue Despite this however ECT still has some argument that the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act puts a nondelegable duty to provide a cargoworthy ship on Mitsubishi

an action against the vessel owners Stuart who was also speaking for John Nowlan wants to arrest the vessel as it arrives in Kuantan West Malaysia to discharge the PX which was to be supplied to ECTS According to Russells calculations below the vessel is due to arrive in Kuantan on or about October The objective is to arrest the vessel while it still has the cargo for the highest nuisance value Since we may be at the brink of commencing action below is a quick status update also for the easy reference of Richard who reads this in copy Cause of Action and Damages As advised by WFW ECTS only has one cause of action against the vessel owners ie failing in their duty to reasonably despatch the vessel to arrive within ETA The cause of action is highly dependant on fact Although we have some evidence that suggest that the initial ETA Daesan of under the charterparty may not have been realistic we still do not have all the facts as to why the vessel was delayed in the preceding port in Yantai China We were told by the vessel owners that the delay was due to the preceding charterers not having the necessary import licence ready which if true works in favour of the charterers As advised by WFW the quantum of damages recoverable remains an issue ECTS is likely to be able to recover the difference in freight about USD but the difference in price of the PX about USD is less certain as the question of remoteness is again fact dependant Suzanne advises that the cases have not always been consistent Winning the case therefore is not a sure thing The above has been communicated to Russell as the matter developed as well as John and Stuart over the phone Arresting the vessel I took Suzanne Bainbridges and Neale Gregsons advice over the phone earlier this evening I am also scheduled to meet with Neale on Monday Oct or with both Neale and Suzanne on Tues Oct depending on Russell going through his tapes I anticipate the meeting to be more likely Monday than Tuesday As advised it is possible to arrest the vessel in Kuantan before the formal commencement of arbitration proceedings For an arrest in Kuantan arrest papers will have to be prepared by Malaysian lawyers There is no need to quantify the claim for the arrest papers under Singapore and English law but can only assume that the same is true under Malaysian law which for most part follow English law The arrest papers have to be endorsed by a Kuantan judge Under English and Singapore law and presumably Malaysian law the cargo owners would have a prima facie case against the arresting party for interfering with the sale and purchase contract However as ECTS has a prima facie case for arrest The arrest would therefore not be wrongful and ECTS would not likely be liable to the cargo owners in that respect The cost for arrest proceedings alone in Singapore are typically around SGD and is likely to be the same in Malaysia However Kuantan is apparently a notoriously difficult place to arrest a vessel because the judge is not usually accomodating and not well versed in admiralty law It was initially thought by Russell and Stuart that the vessel would be in Kuantan over the weekend Russell has since confirmed that that is not the case This is fortunate because Neale advises that there would have been almost no chance of getting an order from the Kuantan judge over the weekend Regards

PRODUCT Matt Thanks for the headsup on this issue I will confer with Janice and one of us will get back to you Meanwhile I think I may need further clarification about what testing methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines My key area of concern is whether as now appears unlikely from your email SGS tested using both ASTM D without ashing and ASTM D with ashing at all the relevant points and whether the test results were consistent eg whether the product was onspec for both methods immediately before loading but offspec for both methods at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines May I impose on you to provide one summary chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports with particular emphasis on a whether both testing methods ASTM D without ashing and with ashing were used and the results and b the results for filterable dirt You have just sent something like this for the Thailand cargo only which I found very helpful Also if SGS or anyone else has made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt analysis or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo please let me know about that as well I appreciate your good help Britt Matthias CT AM To Janice R CT Britt NRON cc Alan CT Harry M CT Angeline CT Subject D Dear Janice Britt I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and coordinate with Mike Browns team and myself in regard to the D issue whilst I am to look to Britts guidance for the contamination on the Elang cargo My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this email The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end next week The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt so we would need to decide in quite short order on the test method we want to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by the level of filterable dirt the metals clearly would also be an important factor As you may be aware the loadport sample results which we are presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded was tested with ashing for metals We would not be able to say whether another loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D If it doesnt test on spec at the joint testing using straight D the vessel owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First Gas anyway independent of the filterable dirt Although such as argument may not defeat our case entirely it is very likely to impact on the quantum we would be able to recover It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would therefore be ashing to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample results We still have SGSs support for that but we need to convince Minton Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the OwnersPI Club Still just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to Firts Gas we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method acceptable to parties whether D or ashing or some other method That said I think if we are able to go with ashing for the joint testing it is not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas I note Janices preference for US experts over European experts for the D issue Have we been able to get any US experts view on the right test to use whether D or ashing Has Enron formed a view on the correct test method If we have been able to source a friendly US expert we may want to have his input for the contamination issue Your views and guidance would be most appreciated Thanks and regards Matt I also note Janices preference to source for US experts to assist us on the D issue over European experts and was wondering whether we have been able to for

Samples for Testing PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt Subject to the views of Jim Studdert and David Best given that we already put underwriters on notice that there was contamination and given that we have worked closely with Mintons underwriters representatives I would assume that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a total quantum before the joint survey takes place in fact it looks like the final determination of ECTs total quantum of damages may be impacted by the results of the joint survey although I would not necessarily want to say that to underwriters at this point My preliminary review of the policy reflects no language in the policy which would require ECT to immediately provide a total quantum The policy specifically requires under INSTRUCTIONS IN CASE OF LOSS that ECT file a claim in writing against the delivering carrier holding him responsible as soon as loss or damage is discovered even though the full exent thereof is not apparent details can be furnished later Such action will not prejudice your insurance claim Let me know if you would like a copy of the pertinent policy I have

Rich Slovenski regarding the Elang presently stored in Thailand He confirms that the intention was to deliver it to First Gas some time end Augustearly September premised on delivery and acceptance of the first Elang cargo and subject to First Gass consumption Cargo still not sold Rich is not immediately able to calculate loss on the cargo basis First Gas Price vs resale price but will be giving it somethought to arrive at an estimate The test results we have to date of the Thai cargo are somewhat inconclusive but indicate Lead and Vanadium may be off spec but principal reason for not delivering to First Gas is uncertainty of D as a test method Summary of Thailand samples test results July Ship Composite sample taken before discharge in Thailand was tested by SGS Thailand for Carbon Residue

dd rd August to Eric from cargo Interests viewpoint it is usually best in these circumstances to keep as many analytical options open as possible Certainly sufficient to enable the best chance of establishing the cause To that end I would recommend that you provide the other Parties with the test methods ASTM Dnumbers and state that these tests will be applied to retain samples from each of Pacific Virgo before after loading Australia all cargo Pacific Virgo before discharge Thailand Batangasnominated tanks if samples available Pacific Virgo before discharge Thailand Thainominated tanks Pacific Virgo on arrival Batangas the samples upon which First Gas based their rejection Pacific Virgo prior departure from Batangas including bottom samples Pacific Virgo prior discharge Korea including bottom samples Pacific Virgo any other samples that are available and that might progress the investigation Some testing may involve composites some individual samples This will to a degree depend on the labs ability to get any particulates into homogeneous suspension and keep them there long enough to make a composite If that cant be done it will have to be individuals Insofar as identifying the particulates should this prove necessary I think we need to keep all options open While it is always possible to perform unilateral analysis should disagreements arise better to keep the Parties together if possible But not at the expense of limiting the analysis ability to determine cause I apologise if this all seems a bit woolly But if you limit at the beginning the potential extent of testing that might be necessary it can all prove meaningless I appreciate that testing cost plays a role in all of this It is in noones interest to do testing just for the sake of it and as far as I am concerned that is not on my agenda nor I am sure is it on Enrons But we must be realistic Depending upon the size of your potential claim have Underwriters been put on notice yet by the way it might be worth spending several K to get to the root of the matter rather than less to learn nothing Best regards Cliff Bennett Minton Treharne Davies S Pte Ltd Original Message From Matthias Lee To Cc Eric Tan Angeline Poon Date Monday August PM Subject Re Pacific Virgo Elang Crude Samples for Testing Dear Cliff Would you be able to draw up a test programme based on your recommendations below with the view to circulate it to all parties including SGS for their agreement prior to joint testing I think such a preagreed programme would be most useful and would avoid any dispute on testing procedure subsequently Eric expects all the samples to arrive in Singapore within the next couple of days and send out the notice to all parties to attend joint testing sometime between August Thanks and best regards Matt Lee Forwarded by Eric TanSINECT on clifford bennett on To Eric Tan cc Subject Re Pacific Virgo Elang Crude Samples for Testing Eric My recommendations concerning joint testing are as follows Samples Ideally at least one set of sealed integrity traceable chain of custody samples from each stage of the shipment should be available at the joint testing The samples will be checked against the appropriate sampling records prior to testing If possible I think we should have samples from Loading Australia one set Pacific Virgos tanks after loading Discharge Thailand one set predischarge vessels tanks Thai parcel if the other Batangas tanks were sampled at this time these samples should be included Batangas one set vessels tanks on arrival plus one set vessels tanks from the most recent sampling before the vessel departed Batangas to include dead bottom samples Korea one set predischarge vessels tanks on arrival including any dead bottom samples Depending on exactly what samples are available testing may encompass both composites and in some cases individual tank samples where particulates are involved the composition of individual tank samples even in a laboratory can destroy the representivity of a sample This by the way is the reason for my concerns over sample decanting in Philippines evidence can be lost Testing I would suggest the laboratory of SGS Singapore because that is where the samples are being collated Provided the testing can be done to the appropriate standard and the methods are available any laboratory would do As advised previously the laboratory tests and the witnesses are there to ensure among other things that all is above board Test schedule As advised previously the basic methods I would recommend are Carbon residue ASTM D Carbon residue bottoms ASTM D Ash ASTM D BSW ASTM D V Na K Ca Pb ASTM D Filterable dirt ASTM D Please note that for filterable dirt ASTM D is not applicable as it is designed for insitu line samples ASTM D is a laboratory method that is essentially equivalent Both methods are intended for particulates in aviation fuels Anyway SGS Singapore can run ASTM D The above suite of tests should be run on all selected samples it will almost certainly not be necessary to test all available samples in duplicate Duplicates are necessary because standalone results are always open to doubt In any event duplicates are often a requirement of the test method and any reputable laboratory will run duplicates as a matter of course Duplicate samples should not mean twice the price Investigative testing This is more difficult to predict in terms of exactly what will be necessary To a degree it will be guided by what is found in the above spec testing My initial recommendation would be to check the solubility of the particulates particularly in aromatic solvent to check if organic and possibly in acid to check if inorganic If as has so far been reported the particulates are not aromatic solvent soluble and because they do not appear to contribute to the ash content of the fuel a best guess might be that they are carbon particles However we need to keep an open mind on this We might need to think about microscopy visible or electron on the particles Possibly also look at elemental analysis of the particles by eg energy dispersive Xray analysis I will give some further thought to what might be required by way of investigative analysis and revert At this stage I suggest that all options on the investigative side are kept open OwnersPI might not agree but realistically we cannot predict what we will find or what might need to be done until we start getting some spec test results and some simple particle solubilities done I trust this helps Please keep me advised regarding samplesjoint test matters Best regards Cliff Bennett Minton Treharne Davies S Pte Ltd Original Message From Eric Tan To Clifford Bennett Cc Richard Slovenski Matthias Lee Angeline

Singapore to do the testing I would like to suggest that our expert ie Steve Jones once fully briefed speaks with the relevant tester at SGS Singapore to satisfy himself that the lab is st class and the tester sufficiently skilled Regards Matt From Britt NRON on AM To Matthias CT cc Janice R CT Alan CT Harry M CT Richard B CT Michael A CT Deborah nron Brenda NRON Subject Re DIn re MV PACIFIC VIRGO PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt Im on the same page as Janice with regard to testing although Id like to spin out my thoughts a bit In my view at the end of the day it is virtually inevitable that both D with ashing and D without ashing are going to be used on the critical loadport sample and therefore for the rest of the samples as well at the joint analysis Mitsubishis strategy at the joint analysis will be to get the remaining loadport sample to come up offspec on retesting for obvious reasons Prior to the joint analysis Mitsubishi will be aware that a D without ashing is in the FGH contract and that b ECT believes D without ashing may have a reproducibility issue with this type of product Given this if ECT proposes to use only D with ashing our safest bet on the loadport sample at the joint analysis Mitsubishi will smell a rat and insist on D without ashing The same would apply I think if even if ECT proposed to use only D without ashing as its sole test at the joint analysis The more different kinds of tests Mitsubishi can forcefully argue should be run the more likely it is that one of them will show the loadport sample is offspec Mitsubishis goal will be supported by the general practice of the chemists involved who will want to rerun every test previously run in order to get to the bottom of this My sense is that it would be very difficult under the circumstances for ECT to credibly take the position that only one test or the other D with ashing or D without ashing should be run in fact in light of what I believe is virtually inevitable Mitsubishi insisting on whatever test we dont propose and in order to keep from appearing to be overly concerned about the reproducibility problem my feeling is that we may want to go ahead and propose both tests to Mitsubishi assuming that it is expected that we would initially propose the proper tests to Mitsubishi and not the other way around Can you let us know exactly who will be doing the handson testing of this product in Singapore I know that we nominated SGS Singapore but does this necessarily mean that someone from SGS will be doing the actual work as opposed to us just using SGSs lab As Janice pointed out we need to make absolutely sure that a the lab is firstclass and b whoever performs the test this time is very experienced with D with and without ashing Also it is my thought that we do not want anyone from SGS there who is aware of the presale analysis that SGS did of the Elang Crude cargo This latter point especially needs to be handled with great care if there is a need to communicate with SGS about any of this I would suggest that you first confer with David or Neal Many thanks for your help Britt Again many thanks for your help Britt Forwarded by Britt DavisCorpEnron on PM Janice R CT AM To Britt NRON cc Alan CT Deborah nron Harry M CT Matthias CT Michael A CT Richard B CT Subject Re DIn re MV PACIFIC VIRGO PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt I agree w Britt that we need to know more about what testing has been done but I would think that the joint test should be conducted using the same method used at loadport regardless of whether ashing is proper or not Not for the reason you mention Mitsubishi may well argue about proper rejection but thats not likely a viable argument since the fact is that First Gas rejected the cargo and the dirt spec alone was sufficient grounds for that rejection but for the sake of consistency It doesnt matter at all to First Gas what test methods were used or will be used on this cargo its no longer any of their concern Its Enrons risk and sole responsibility to deal w costs following rejection per the contract I hope that we are not informing First Gas about anything that has happened or will happen on this cargo I noticed a note from Jon Russell inquiring about the cargo I trust that we have politely refused to tell them anything Regards Janice EB Assistant General Counsel Enron North America Corp Fax Britt NRON AM To Matthias CT cc Janice R CT Alan CT Harry M CT Richard B CT Michael A CT Deborah nron Subject Re DIn re MV PACIFIC VIRGO PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt Thanks for the headsup on this issue I will confer with Janice and one of us will get back to you Meanwhile I think I may need further clarification about what testing methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines My key area of concern is whether as now appears unlikely from your email SGS tested using both ASTM D without ashing and ASTM D with ashing at all the relevant points and whether the test results were consistent eg whether the product was onspec for both methods immediately before loading but offspec for both methods at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines May I impose on you to provide one summary chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports with particular emphasis on a whether both testing methods ASTM D without ashing and with ashing were used and the results and b the results for filterable dirt You have just sent something like this for the Thailand cargo only which I found very helpful Also if SGS or anyone else has made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt analysis or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo please let me know about that as well I appreciate your good help Britt Matthias CT AM To Janice R CT Britt NRON cc Alan CT Harry M CT Angeline CT Subject D Dear Janice Britt I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and coordinate with Mike Browns team and myself in regard to the D issue whilst I am to look to Britts guidance for the contamination on the Elang cargo My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this email The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end next week The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt so we would need to decide in quite short order on the test method we want to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by the level of filterable dirt the metals clearly would also be an important factor As you may be aware the loadport sample results which we are presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded was tested with ashing for metals We would not be able to say whether another loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D If it doesnt test on spec at the joint testing using straight D the vessel owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First Gas anyway independent of the filterable dirt Although such as argument may not defeat our case entirely it is very likely to impact on the quantum we would be able to recover It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would therefore be ashing to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample results We still have SGSs support for that but we need to convince Minton Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the OwnersPI Club Still just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to Firts Gas we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method acceptable to parties whether D or ashing or some other method That said I think if we are able to go with ashing for the joint testing it is not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas I note Janices preference for US experts over European experts for the D issue Have we been able to get any US experts view on the right test to use whether D or ashing Has Enron formed a view on the correct test method If we have been able to source a friendly US expert we may want to have his input for the contamination issue Your views and guidance would be most appreciated Thanks and regards Matt I also note Janices preference to source for US experts to assist us on the D issue over European experts and was wondering whether we have been able to for

ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt it was a pleasure speaking with you this evening your time As I mentioned I have some followup fact questions that I would appreciate your help with when you have a moment Some of these questions probably require the attention of experts eg s and so feel free to decline to answer where the question appears outside your jurisdiction Please do not call anyone outside of Enron to get answers at this point also to the extent that you need to ask Enron employees for answers I would prefer your asking them questions and writing down the answers to be kept in your investigation file rather sending them this email and getting email responses A chronology sent by you as an attachment to your letter of July to Mike Robison reflects that on November a sample of Elang Condensate was taken by SGS Redwood Singapore Apparently the Filterable Dirt was off spec versus a max of With regard to this sampling a Did Enron request it YES If so who requested it JOHN CHISMARERIC TANand for what purposePRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF SUITABILITY OF ELANG CONDENSATE BEFORE PURCHASE b Was the sample taken from one of the shore tanks from which the cargo at issue was loaded If not from what location was the sample obtained SAMPLE WAS TAKEN FROM A FLOATING FACILITY NOT SHORETANK UNCLEAR WHETHER FROM SAME TANK AS LOADED CARGO LOADED CARGO LIKELY TO HAVE COME FROM A FEW TANKS c Did the testing reveal that anything else that has us concerned about the present cargo such as the presence of metals NO d Did Enron do any followup with Phillips who I understand was the supplier about the offspec dirt or anything else that was discovered during the sampling If so please give the particulars as to who was involved what was said and what the result was NOT SURE IF JOHN CHISMAR SPOKE WITH PHILLIPS BUT NOTE THAT CARGO WAS NOT BOUGHT WITH GUARANTEED FGH TYPE SPECS BUT NORMAL EXPORT QUALITY AT THE TIME AND PLACE OF LOADING e Has the sample been retained NOVEMBER SAMPLE ALL USED UP AT TESTING Did Enron discuss with the supplier athe proposed end use of this product b its fitness for that end use andor c the contract specs that Enron had to meet to satisfy FGH If not why not JOHN CHISMARS INPUT REQUIRED Another chronology prepared by you mentions that a loadport analysis was performed by SGS on June and that our cargo met the FGH contract specs I assume in all regards YES ASHING METHOD USED Do we still have that sample available for retesting and will a restest of it be included in the current round of testing THE SAMPLES WERE DRAWN AT LOADPORT FROM AN AUTOSAMPLER XL SAMPLES WERE USED UP AT THE JUNE TEST WE PRESENTLY HAVE A XL LOADPORT SAMPLE FROM THE AUTOSAMPLER IN SINGAPORE RESERVED FOR JOINT TESTING AND ANALYSIS IN SINGAPORE THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER XL LOADPORT SAMPLE FROM THE AUTOSAMPLER IN OWNERSPI CLUB POSSESSION WHICH WE HAVE ASKED TO BE SURRENDERED TO US TO BE DELIVERED TO SINGAPORE WHERE ALL SAMPLES ARE BEING COLLATED FOR JOINT TESTING AND ANALYSIS Why is this product called Elang Crude when it is in reality reportedly condensate CARGO CALLED CRUDE BY SUPPLIER APPARENTLY BECAUSE OF EXPORT REASONS HAVE TO CHECK WITH JOHN CHISMAR UNDERSTAND FROM SPEAKING WITH PACMARINE THAT AN ULTRALIGHT CRUDE LIKE ELANG CAN GENERALLY BE REFERRED TO AS CONDENSATE BUT THERE IS NO REAL BENCHMARK AS TO HOW LIGHT A CRUDE MUST BE BEFORE IT CAN RIGHTLY BE REGARDED AS CONDENSATE What is the meaning of the term export grade Are there various other gradations If so what do those mean JOHN CHISMARS INPUT REQUIRED Has Enron ever purchased Elang Crude from this supplier previously NO Ever heard of any prior problems with Elang Crude from this supplier NO NOTE THAT CONDENSATE IS TYPICALLY DELIVERED TO REFINERIES NOT POWER PLANTS THAT ARE NOT TOO CONCERNED WITH DETAILED SPECS Has Enron ever chartered the PACIFIC VIRGO in the past to transport Elang Crude NOIf so please give a thumbnail description of the voyages If not have we ever chartered the PACIFIC VIRGO at allNO Prior to this voyage have our operations folks ever chartered any vessel to transport a cargo of Elang CrudeNO HOWEVER WE MADE DELIVERIES OF SENIPAH CONDENSATE FROM INDONESIA ONE IN FEB AND ANOTHER IN MAY UNDER THE FGH CONTRACT If so please give a thumbnail description of the voyages including a whether the tanks were Butterworthed SENIPAH CARGO NOT BUTTERWORTHED BUT INSTRUCTIONS WERE GIVEN TO TANK CLEAN PRIMARILY BECAUSE LAST CARGOES WERE CARBON BLACK FEEDSTOCK MAY AND FUELOIL FEB TANK CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED WASHING AND FLUSHING TANKS PIPES AND PUMPS and if so whether Enron had to pay extra WE DID NOT HAVE TO PAY EXTRA ON BOTH OCCASIONS IT IS ONLY IN THE CP OF PACIFIC VIRGO THAT WE AGREED TO BEAR COSTS FOR CLEANING b whether the end use of the Elang Crude was similar to the end use of the cargo here BOTH SENIPAH CONDENSATE CARGOES WERE FOR FGH and c whether there were any contamination problemsconcerns NO NOTE HOWEVER THAT ASHING METHOD WAS USED BY SGS ON BOTH FEB AND MAY SENIPAH CARGOES Who were the Enron ops personnel who negotiated the Butterrworth issue with the owners ERIC TAN If there are written documents memorializing this including letters telexes telefaxes emails taped or recorded telephone messages calendar entries or diary entries they need to be preserved I wonder if I could put you in charge of making sure that all files relevant to this voyage generally are carefully preserved for possible use as evidence later on One thing we dont want to happen is to face a spurious charge of spoliation of evidence because an allegedly important document or memo from our files is inadvertantly lost or destroyed The Watson Farley letter opinion of July notes that the BL identified the actual owners as the carriers rather than Mitsubishi who I understand was probably a timecharterer THE BROKER HAS CONFIRMED MITSUBISHI CORP TO BE THE TIME CHARTERER The copies of the BL that I have seen however reflect a blank space in the form underneath the word CARRIER Do you have access to a BL that mentions the name of the actual owner NO Perhaps Watson Farley meant that because Barwil Agencies signed on behalf of the master that the true owner was bound although I am just guessing MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE SAME The PacMarine report dated July ascribes the cause of the contamination to a accumulation of excessive sediments in the ships cargo tanks especially clinkage and b the cleansing properties of condensate Although the author refrains from squarely linking the excessive sediments to prior inadequate tank cleaning he clearly leans in that direction On the other hand it is not clear from the report whether adequate tank cleaning under the circumstances required Butterworthing I SPOKE WITH PACMARINE CAPT SAWANT HIS OPINION IS THAT BUTTERWORTHING OR USING THE VESSELS ON BOARD EQUIPMENT TO RINSE AND FLUSH TANKS PIPES AND PUMPS WITH FRESHWATER WOULD HAVE BEEN ADEQUATE CLEANING a Were our ops people aware of the prior cargoes WE WERE AWARE OF THE LAST CARGOESand the methods used to clean the tanks WE WERE AWARE THAT NO TANK CLEANING WAS DONE PRIOR TO LOADING THE LAST CARGO andor the cleansing property of condensates YES BUT THE ASSUMPTION MADE WAS THE PREVIOUS CARGO OF COSSACK CRUDE WITH SIMILAR PROPERTIES WOULD HAVE CLEANED THE TANK AND THE VESSEL BEING YOUNG WOULD NOT HAVE A LOT OF CLINKAGE I get the impression from your Issue for Consideration that the answer to the prior cargoes part of this question is yes b Was it within the scope of SGSs duties to advise Enron of the foregoing NO I WOULD NEED EXPERT SUPPORT ON WHETHER IT IS OWNER OR CHARTERERS DUTY TO KNOW SUITABLE TANK CLEANING METHOD or were they only supposed to issue a Dry Certificate c Did we have anyone else attend the ship at loading on our behalf besides SGS NO I know this covers a lot of information none of it is urgent Next week will be fine for a response Many thanks for your help BKD

filterable dirt but off spec for Ramsbottom Carbon Residue Please note however that the sale to Caltex Singapore was not sold on FGH contract specs but normal export quality ie without specs Rejection

CT Matthias CT cc Deborah nron Brenda NRON Subject In re MV PACIFIC VIRGO PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Heres an update Matt if any of this appears inaccurate to you dont hesitate to point it out The pending joint survey a The joint survey has yet to be scheduled The reason for the delay is an issue concerning whether SGSs Singapore laboratory has the resourcescompetence to carry out the joint analysis Steve Jones ECTs choice of chemist is communicating with SGS in order to make this determination Although this has delayed scheduling the joint testing Jones feels strongly that it will be most costeffective for ECT to proceed with a joint analysis only after making this determination I and Matt have personally spoken with Jones about this and believe he understands that ECT is looking for the quickest most costeffective resolution to this dispute with Mitsubishi Because of the issue with SGS Jones has waited until now to send the proposed testing program to Technichem Mitsubishis choice of surveyorchemist in a previous report I mentioned that the testing program had already been sent to Technichem this now turns out not to be the case By today Jones should have sent the proposed testing program to Technichem in order to get the ball rolling and with the expectation that Technichem will have comments that will require time to incorporate b If things go well with SGS Jones anticipates scheduling a joint analysis about twothree weeks from now Jones plan to personally attend the joint survey on our behalf given the complexity of the testing methods Even after that testing Jones anticipates the possibility of further testing in England using highly specialized equipment to determine whether the apparent filterable dirt buildup was caused by a malfunction of the vessels inert gas system Costs a Surveyorschemists Jones advises that to date he and his firm have spent a total of about days at pounds per day for a total of approximately pounds or roughly at the current USDpounds exchange rate of pound Jones has subcontracted some of his work to Allen Goddard now with ITSCaleb Brett who specializes in the type of testing at issue Jones estimates that Goddard has spent approximately one day on this matter at a daily rate of lbs or Jones estimates that from this point until the actual joint survey begins he will spend about two more days and Goddard will spend about another onehalf day This totals about pounds or For the actual joint testing Jones estimates that he will spend about twelve days straight including transit time Goddard would not attend but would be available by telephone if Jones had a question Twelve days time amounts to pounds or not including aire fare room and board Afterwards for the additional testing in England to determine whether the inert gas system caused the buildup in filterable dirt Jones estimates another pounds for the cost of the lab he does not know at this point whether he would attend the entire testing procedure which he believes could be completed in about two days If he attended both days this additional testing in England would run to another pounds or b Other experts SGS and Caleb Bretts costs to date are being compiled by Matt SGS will spend another SGD purchasing the necessary chemicals for the joint testing and bill for another SGD for prejointanalysis development work basically practicing on extra samples from the PACIFIC VIRGO This comes to a total of SGD or about to prepare for the joint analysis based on the current reported SGDUSD exchange rate of SGS estimates that it will bill us for the joint analysis SGD or about Captain Sawant of PacMarine one of our ship operations experts will be charging us SGD or about for work done to date which should be largely concluded with the finalization of his report Captain Gregory of Noble Denton the ship operation expert we would probably use for testifying has been asked to do no work on this matter at this time c Attorneys David Best is out of town on vacation but his office advises that his time and expenses to date amounts to approximately pounds or about This is subject to being adjusted up or down once Best gets back in the office and has time to review the bill I imagine that this bill does not include the time incurred by a barrister that Best called for advice on the FGH issue Neither Best nor anyone from his firm will need to attend the joint testing Neale Gregsons firm Watson Farley has incurred fees and expense to date of SGD or about Matt has not yet seen an itemized bill for this time but feels that while it is high it is not unexpected given the timeintensive nature of this matter Matt will be asking Gregson whether the time also includes time spent on the FGH matter My and my legal assistants fee and expenses through today amount to approximately This also includes time spent on the FGH matter although pursuant to Alans instructions I am no longer spending time on that matter except where necessary to keep Janice Moore apprised d Summary of Costs In sum no less than approximately has been spent to date and this figure will increase once I get the SGS and Caleb Brett costs to date and once David Best comes back from vacation on September and reviews his bill although these figures probably include a heavy overlap of time spent on the FGH matter Another will be necessary to get ready for the joint analysis another to perform the joint analysis in Singapore and another approximately to perform specialized testing in London after the joint analysis is done if Steve Jones determines that such further testing is necessary Recent Sale of Thailand cargo a You will recall that the bulk of the product from the MV PACIFIC VIRGO was discharged in to shore tanks in Thailand and has not been tendered to FGH given the problems with the product discharged later in the Phillipines which was tendered to FGH who rejected it Samples from the shore tanks in Thailand have recently been tested by SGSs laboratory in the US and reportedly found on spec All of the Thailand product has recently been sold to Caltex Singapore for delivery September reportedly for use in Caltexs refinery which makes the risk of rejection of that product by Caltex very low b Unfortunately Matt advises that the trader cannot give us even a ballpark figure for the sales price of the Thailand product until the end of the month given that the price is tied to some market index Lacking this it is difficult to estimate what total diminution in market value of the Elang crude ECT has sustained until then We were previously told that the product discharged in Singapore sustained a diminution in market value of about For my own purposes based on nothing more than speculation and given that the bulk of the cargo was discharged in Thailand I am using the working hypothesis that ECTs total damages for diminution of market value of all the product discharged from the MV PACIFIC VIRGO is in the range of Again this may later turn out to be very inaccurate Expert witness supplemental opinion At my request Captain Sawant our consulting expert on ship operations was asked whether he believed that ECTs instructions to the ship regarding tank washing would have been sufficient to prevent the type of contamination that occurred had such instructions been properly carried out ie if the ship had access to fresh water Captain Sawant has opined that he does not believe such instructions were sufficient to have prevented the type of contamination that occurred While we can protect Captain Sawants opinion from discovery by using him only as a consulting expert it strikes me that Mitsubishi will likely not overlook this issue Despite this however ECT still has some argument that the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act puts a nondelegable duty to provide a cargoworthy ship on Mitsubishi

Korea To Jae Moo Impressive Ppoint presentation indeed Friday Sep am TYO time is good for Australia I will be attending is there anything that i need to arrange at our end After the successful rollout of W for Japan Oz thus qtr as discussed we are ready to rollout Korean W say in Mid October Your email presenatation thus arrived at a very good time Just some questions You may answer in the conference call or by email your choice a why has W derivatives been singled out by FSC for potential review when there is no regulation of eg LPG or plastics swaps fwds pg of presentation We are just talking about the theoretical possibility of FSCs Financial Supervisory Commission review of Weather Derivatives because of the novelt y in Korea although according to the Kim Chang report there are currently no laws or regulations in Korea that regulate marketing of OTC derivative transactions through the internet or otherwise When we talked to FSC a couple of months ago they confirmed that there is no law or regulation restricting Weather Derivatives in Korea FSC did not indicate any intenti on to review Weather Derivatives for regulation either In addition according to the Kim Chang report Weather Derivatives would not be considered to be an insurance contract subject to Korean insurance regulations Kim Chang also believes that Weather Derivatives should not be considered gambling or wagering but a legitimate method of hedging risks relating to weather b How necessary are the meetings with pg of presentation Bank of Korea BOK Ministry of Finance Economy MOFE for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives Is this meeting to meet except for Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations FETR in case of foreign currency trades Classification of weather derivatives as commodity or financial derivativ es under FETR needs to be resolvedpg of presentation Can we just do it first with Enron Korea as the counterparty If so if Korean coy transacts with Enron Korea there should be no problem in remitting funds wholly within Korea Also we intend to offer product in Won only so no FX involved at all According to the Kim Chang report FETR is the only regulation that regulates OTC derivative transactions and FETR is applicable only when FX is involved in a transaction or when a transaction is between a Korean residen t and a nonresident Thus as far as we understand based on the Kim Chang report and conversations with FSC and other local lawyers if a transaction Weather derivative or other commodity derivative is between residents in Korea eg a Korean customer and Enron Korea in Korean currency Won neither FETR nor any other regulations are applicable No report or approv al would be required c pg of presentation All other EnronOnline products with the exception of bandwidth and emission allowances are classified as commodity derivatives in Korea Why is it bandwidth and emission are classified differently Will not Weather fall under same category There is no classification or definition of bandwidth emission or weather derivative products in Korea since Korea has no experience in such products or concepts Please refer to my previous email to Matt for definitions of derivative transactions commodity and financial Commodity derivatives require a prior reporting to the Bank of Korea fo r each trade Is this only relevant if product is not in Won but foreign currency The reporting requirement is relevant under the FETR only which is applied for a transaction with FX involved or between a resident and nonresident i n Korea pg of presentation Note that Dr Christian Werner Sydney office will be the person for Data system For weather derivative products arrange with a weather forecasting company for the weather data feed timing depends on the location We will provide relevant information for Christian We will be able to assist with if reqd see points b c above Thanks It would be necessary only when we decide to deal with FETR For weather derivatives arrange presentation meetings with BOKMO FE for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives May require longer time for their decision making Korea

Environment it may be useful to note There is no official rule or regulation that ex post facto reporting for Commodity Derivatives are acceptable to the Bank of Korea although your an d Korean external lawyers Kim Chang informal verbal enquiries with the Bank of Korea have suggested they have accepted some or reports since April last year all from Hyundai Oil The Bank of Korea take up to two weeks to review the reports and as Kim Chang has advised there remains a possibility that the Bank of Korea may reject the report although they were not able to advise the grounds on whi ch a report may be rejected Although a foreign counterparty need not file a report or seek approval the Korean counterparty must still do so for the benefit and interest of th e foreign counterparty Kim Chang advised that where reporting or approval is required but is not made or obtained the Korean counterparty would not be able to remit its payments under the transaction This would clearly impact on the settlement of the transaction in particular shorter term deals sinc e reporting and approval may take several weeks The Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that a foreign exchange authorizati on that was originally required should be obtained in order for a foreign part y to execute any judgment against the Korean party and remit the proceeds Regards Matt JaeMoo NRON PM To Christopher B

to progress much further from this point however substantial attention by the EOL team would be required To facilitate this the attached presentation summarizes our primary findings to date and some

Korea To Jae Moo Impressive Ppoint presentation indeed Friday Sep am TYO time is good for Australia I will be attending is there anything that i need to arrange at our end After the successful rollout of W for Japan Oz thus qtr as discussed we are ready to rollout Korean W say in Mid October Your email presenatation thus arrived at a very good time Just some questions You may answer in the conference call or by email your choice a why has W derivatives been singled out by FSC for potential review when there is no regulation of eg LPG or plastics swaps fwds pg of presentation We are just talking about the theoretical possibility of FSCs Financial Supervisory Commission review of Weather Derivatives because of the novelt y in Korea although according to the Kim Chang report there are currently no laws or regulations in Korea that regulate marketing of OTC derivative transactions through the internet or otherwise When we talked to FSC a couple of months ago they confirmed that there is no law or regulation restricting Weather Derivatives in Korea FSC did not indicate any intenti on to review Weather Derivatives for regulation either In addition according to the Kim Chang report Weather Derivatives would not be considered to be an insurance contract subject to Korean insurance regulations Kim Chang also believes that Weather Derivatives should not be considered gambling or wagering but a legitimate method of hedging risks relating to weather b How necessary are the meetings with pg of presentation Bank of Korea BOK Ministry of Finance Economy MOFE for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives Is this meeting to meet except for Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations FETR in case of foreign currency trades Classification of weather derivatives as commodity or financial derivativ es under FETR needs to be resolvedpg of presentation Can we just do it first with Enron Korea as the counterparty If so if Korean coy transacts with Enron Korea there should be no problem in remitting funds wholly within Korea Also we intend to offer product in Won only so no FX involved at all According to the Kim Chang report FETR is the only regulation that regulates OTC derivative transactions and FETR is applicable only when FX is involved in a transaction or when a transaction is between a Korean residen t and a nonresident Thus as far as we understand based on the Kim Chang report and conversations with FSC and other local lawyers if a transaction Weather derivative or other commodity derivative is between residents in Korea eg a Korean customer and Enron Korea in Korean currency Won neither FETR nor any other regulations are applicable No report or approv al would be required c pg of presentation All other EnronOnline products with the exception of bandwidth and emission allowances are classified as commodity derivatives in Korea Why is it bandwidth and emission are classified differently Will not Weather fall under same category There is no classification or definition of bandwidth emission or weather derivative products in Korea since Korea has no experience in such products or concepts Please refer to my previous email to Matt for definitions of derivative transactions commodity and financial Commodity derivatives require a prior reporting to the Bank of Korea fo r each trade Is this only relevant if product is not in Won but foreign currency The reporting requirement is relevant under the FETR only which is applied for a transaction with FX involved or between a resident and nonresident i n Korea pg of presentation Note that Dr Christian Werner Sydney office will be the person for Data system For weather derivative products arrange with a weather forecasting company for the weather data feed timing depends on the location We will provide relevant information for Christian We will be able to assist with if reqd see points b c above Thanks It would be necessary only when we decide to deal with FETR For weather derivatives arrange presentation meetings with BOKMO FE for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives May require longer time for their decision making Korea

Environment it may be useful to note There is no official rule or regulation that ex post facto reporting for Commodity Derivatives are acceptable to the Bank of Korea although your an d Korean external lawyers Kim Chang informal verbal enquiries with the Bank of Korea have suggested they have accepted some or reports since April last year all from Hyundai Oil The Bank of Korea take up to two weeks to review the reports and as Kim Chang has advised there remains a possibility that the Bank of Korea may reject the report although they were not able to advise the grounds on whi ch a report may be rejected Although a foreign counterparty need not file a report or seek approval the Korean counterparty must still do so for the benefit and interest of th e foreign counterparty Kim Chang advised that where reporting or approval is required but is not made or obtained the Korean counterparty would not be able to remit its payments under the transaction This would clearly impact on the settlement of the transaction in particular shorter term deals sinc e reporting and approval may take several weeks The Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that a foreign exchange authorizati on that was originally required should be obtained in order for a foreign part y to execute any judgment against the Korean party and remit the proceeds Regards Matt JaeMoo NRON PM To Christopher B

Korea To Jae Moo Impressive Ppoint presentation indeed Friday Sep am TYO time is good for Australia I will be attending is there anything that i need to arrange at our end After the successful rollout of W for Japan Oz thus qtr as discussed we are ready to rollout Korean W say in Mid October Your email presenatation thus arrived at a very good time Just some questions You may answer in the conference call or by email your choice a why has W derivatives been singled out by FSC for potential review when there is no regulation of eg LPG or plastics swaps fwds pg of presentation We are just talking about the theoretical possibility of FSCs Financial Supervisory Commission review of Weather Derivatives because of the novelt y in Korea although according to the Kim Chang report there are currently no laws or regulations in Korea that regulate marketing of OTC derivative transactions through the internet or otherwise When we talked to FSC a couple of months ago they confirmed that there is no law or regulation restricting Weather Derivatives in Korea FSC did not indicate any intenti on to review Weather Derivatives for regulation either In addition according to the Kim Chang report Weather Derivatives would not be considered to be an insurance contract subject to Korean insurance regulations Kim Chang also believes that Weather Derivatives should not be considered gambling or wagering but a legitimate method of hedging risks relating to weather b How necessary are the meetings with pg of presentation Bank of Korea BOK Ministry of Finance Economy MOFE for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives Is this meeting to meet except for Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations FETR in case of foreign currency trades Classification of weather derivatives as commodity or financial derivativ es under FETR needs to be resolvedpg of presentation Can we just do it first with Enron Korea as the counterparty If so if Korean coy transacts with Enron Korea there should be no problem in remitting funds wholly within Korea Also we intend to offer product in Won only so no FX involved at all According to the Kim Chang report FETR is the only regulation that regulates OTC derivative transactions and FETR is applicable only when FX is involved in a transaction or when a transaction is between a Korean residen t and a nonresident Thus as far as we understand based on the Kim Chang report and conversations with FSC and other local lawyers if a transaction Weather derivative or other commodity derivative is between residents in Korea eg a Korean customer and Enron Korea in Korean currency Won neither FETR nor any other regulations are applicable No report or approv al would be required c pg of presentation All other EnronOnline products with the exception of bandwidth and emission allowances are classified as commodity derivatives in Korea Why is it bandwidth and emission are classified differently Will not Weather fall under same category There is no classification or definition of bandwidth emission or weather derivative products in Korea since Korea has no experience in such products or concepts Please refer to my previous email to Matt for definitions of derivative transactions commodity and financial Commodity derivatives require a prior reporting to the Bank of Korea fo r each trade Is this only relevant if product is not in Won but foreign currency The reporting requirement is relevant under the FETR only which is applied for a transaction with FX involved or between a resident and nonresident i n Korea pg of presentation Note that Dr Christian Werner Sydney office will be the person for Data system For weather derivative products arrange with a weather forecasting company for the weather data feed timing depends on the location We will provide relevant information for Christian We will be able to assist with if reqd see points b c above Thanks It would be necessary only when we decide to deal with FETR For weather derivatives arrange presentation meetings with BOKMO FE for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives May require longer time for their decision making Korea

Environment it may be useful to note There is no official rule or regulation that ex post facto reporting for Commodity Derivatives are acceptable to the Bank of Korea although your an d Korean external lawyers Kim Chang informal verbal enquiries with the Bank of Korea have suggested they have accepted some or reports since April last year all from Hyundai Oil The Bank of Korea take up to two weeks to review the reports and as Kim Chang has advised there remains a possibility that the Bank of Korea may reject the report although they were not able to advise the grounds on whi ch a report may be rejected Although a foreign counterparty need not file a report or seek approval the Korean counterparty must still do so for the benefit and interest of th e foreign counterparty Kim Chang advised that where reporting or approval is required but is not made or obtained the Korean counterparty would not be able to remit its payments under the transaction This would clearly impact on the settlement of the transaction in particular shorter term deals sinc e reporting and approval may take several weeks The Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that a foreign exchange authorizati on that was originally required should be obtained in order for a foreign part y to execute any judgment against the Korean party and remit the proceeds Regards Matt JaeMoo NRON PM To Christopher B
