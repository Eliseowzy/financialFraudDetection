mailtoIMCEANOTESMollandCMichaelEECMMollandbrobeckEcomE NRONcom Sent Wednesday June PM To Williams Robert C Cc Sanders Richard B Fergus Gary S Subject Discussion of document retention policy for EES Bob Williams Andrew Edison Michael Molland Amanda Smith and two IT professionals working with EES Jon Eastlund and Pete van de Gohn today discussed a going forward document retention policy for EES as a result of the California AGs subpoena This is a summary of our discussion Agreement with AG with respect to EPMIPortland I per my conversation with Gary Fergus confirmed that the document retention policy that was negotiated in December with the AG with respect to EPMI in Portland is as follows All employees are instructed not to delete any email for hours Each hours a backup snapshot of the entire email server in Portland is taken After hours employees may delete email This policy has been in place since midDecember and backup tapes should exist for email for each day from midDecember through the present Description of Email server organization within EES All EES employees are on one of two email systems the exchange serverLegacy system or Lotus Notes The exchangeLegacy system is run off of three servers located in San Ramon California Costa Mesa California and Phoenix Arizona The Lotus Notes server is in Houston The majority of EES personnel in California probably are on the exchangeLegacy server but there is no way of knowing who is which server without individually checking EES personnel who were originally hired in California probably use the Legacy system Generally the only inCalifornia personnel who use the Lotus Notes system are those who were originally hired by EES to work outside of California Virtually all EES employees outside California use the Lotus Notes system Current email retention of Legacy system The customary practice is to keep daily back up tapes which are over written weekly as well as one weekly snapshot of the system which is overwritten after days As of last week the exchangeLegacy server is being preserved as follows the daily and weekly tapes are no longer being overwritten and are being preserved by Jon Eastlund Jon is checking with his subordinate in Costa Mesa to confirm that this is also being done in Costa Mesa Jon reports that the earliest weekly back up tape which is still preserved dates from May th He is keeping that tape in San Ramon until it can be picked up by Brobeck Retention of email of Lotus Notes System The Lotus Notes server is backed up every day but the back tapes are erased after seven days and this policy is continuing As of several weeks ago when B Williams first sent out notification to Pete Van de Gohn and the IT staff in Houston the Lotus Notes server is being preserved as follows the auto purge and the delete functions on the computers of certain key personnel have been disabled for certain EES personneleg Sunde and Benevides In addition more recently the auto purge function was disabled on the computers of additional personnel the Golden Bear team who use the system As of today Pete will disable the delete function for those additional personnel as well Going forward we discussed several different policies that EES might institute First we discussed the idea of instituting a policy like that in place at EPMI in Portland ie preserving the daily back up tapes that are already being made but overwritten after a week or soin the ordinary course of business This policy will create a significant amount of information that will be difficult and expensive to search if it is requested However it is apparently consistent with the policy in place at EPMI Portland and is possible to do on both email systems Second as an alternative to preserving backup tapes we discussed disabling the delete function on the computers of key personnel This is now being done for the Lotus Notes system However we understand that the exchangeLegacy system may not have an auto purge function Jon will check whether the delete disabling function can be accomplished on the exchangeLegacy system and report back This second alternative preserves email that will be relatively easy to search for production However it may be difficult to implement for California personal on the legacy email system Third we discussed instructing key EES personnel at issue to move all potentially responsive emails into folders on the system which may they be protected reproduced and reviewedThis would be the least burdensome potentially leaves us open to the fox is guarding the henhouse argument by the AG Data ServersWe discussed data servers briefly All personnel are on different servers for their word documents and spread sheets This system has no autopurge function However the only way that a document can be deleted is if a user actually deliberately deletes it from the system Accordingly there seems less need to initiate further backup of this server Finally we agreed EES lawyers should send emails to all key EES personnel confirming our earlier instruction to them that they not delete email documents or messages A draft email on this subject follows This email confirms that EES has instituted an interim document retention policy as a result of the investigation commenced by the California Attorney General Until further notice please do not delete any nonpersonal email from your inbox or any documents from the data servers In lieu of deleting any of your email please transfer it to a folder in your email system for storage If you need instructions

which reside within California which are clearly and unambiguously called for by the subpoena on the condition that we reach an acceptable confidentiality order to govern their production We are ready to begin doing so on or about July I suggest we send this letter before the close of business today Please let me know if you think we should modify this position or add to it Original Message From

Original Message From Molland Michael E ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESMollandCMichaelEECMMollandbrobeckEcomE NRONcom Sent Monday July PM To Williams Robert C Fergus Gary S Sanders Richard B Subject Meetings with EES Employees in Houston Benevides Whalon Bresna n Lewis Here is my report attached as a word document on my recent meetings with EES employees Jubran Whalon Neil Bresnan Dennis Benevides Jay Lewis and Scott Stoness in Houston A description of their account of the documents in Houston which appear to be called for by the AGs subpena to EES follows in the text of this email Discussion of Specific Document Requests No All contracts for retail sale These are both in California and Houston Nos and All contracts under which EES has purchased electricity on the western interconnection between and the end of About five percent of these contracts are for green power made with various entities The vast majority approximately are contracts with EPMI which purchased all electricity load for EES There may be also a few contracts with APX EES has paper fax copies of all these deals Their understanding is that EPMI charged EES exactly what the utilities would have paid on the California market While they do not know how EPMI actually provided for the power they believe EPMI probably did not buy most of it on the California market They believe all these contracts are voidable if they are revealed to any third party They characterize all this information as extremely sensitive They believe with this information if given enough time and a few other variables parties could construct Enrons price curves No Documents which identify the purchases of EES for power in the day ahead hour ahead or real time markets operated by the PX or Cal ISO They say there are none EES was a scheduling coordinator but never used the function No Documents relating to portfolio of energy supply sources relied upon EES to meet contractual obligations to NUs customers in California There are no such documents No Documents relating to the assessment of risks regarding the cost of purchasing electricity in California They do not believe there are such documents but there may be presentations on this issue No Documents relating to strategies or business plans designed to minimize risks with regard to the cost of purchasing electricity necessary to serve customers All EES officers and traders receive daily reports to corporate goals for EES and show how EES was performing in conformity with these goals They characterized these documents as extremely sensitive They use these on a daily basis Most of these goals are based upon the price curves They also receive month end reports which show how each division is doing according to these corporate goals They believe that a corporate function called Risk Control would have custody of these reports Vladimir Gorny sp was said to be the person in charge of these No Documents relating to decisions to return direct access customers to default utility distributors in California including documents relating to cost savings They believe these documents exist in Houston They believe there are spreadsheets which show the cost savings or revenue enhancements that EES would have received as a result of returning customers to utilities They believe Don Black would have these They believe all these documents would reveal price curves No Communications relating to the return of direct access customers in California There may be spreadsheets which exist on this subject They believe that Don Black would have them No Documents sufficient to identify persons most knowledgeable about decisions made to return direct access customers in California These would be the same documents as No No Documents related to the assessment of the dramatic increases in electricity in California They dont know if these documents exist or not There may be some presentations on the subject No All documents relating to strategy and business plans designed to maximize revenues from the sale of electricity in California They construe this request to refer to origination documents These would be with the person that was in charge of selling services in California during the period in question They believe Doug Condon sp or Harold Buchanan would have these documents No Documents that show sales to California Department of Water Resources They dont believe there are such documents Nos Contracts obligating them to either supply or purchase electricity which they prematurely terminated They dont believe there are any contracts which they prematurely terminated Some contracts were terminated but by agreement The only possible exception may be the University of California contract No Organizational charts which show the persons with authority for risk management They believe Dave Delaney or Marty Sunde Vice Chairman of EES might have such charts No Documents relating to risk management of trading activities on California markets for electricity or natural gas and pipeline capacity These again may be guidelines which Delaney or Sunde might have No Organizational charts regarding those who have responsibility for approving charters and objectives for making risk management decisions They believe Jess Hewitts department might have these They believe these refer to risk management procedures to prevent conflict of interest among EES traders No Documents relating to development approval of charters and objectives for making risk management decisions They believe there is a master agreement on this subject They believe Rick Byers sp might have this agreement They also believe this request refers to guidelines regarding conflict of interest for traders under their risk management policies Nos Documents which identify financial and ownership positions of natural gas or capacity to deliver and transport natural gas to California Gas contracts are handled by a different department at EES They believe that some of these gas contracts were purchased by EPMI but had no direct knowledge of them They believe EES may have purchased its own gas or pipeline capacity because EES has the necessary credit to accomplish this EES had its own power desk that scheduled gas However they probably purchased most of it from Enron North America ees houston meetingsdoc This email message is for the sole

Richard B Williams Robert C Cc Meringolo Peter Smith Amanda D Fergus Gary S Subject FW Status Report of Enron Corp and EES document identification and production efforts in response to California investigative subpoenas We are continuing to identify and review potentially responsive documents within California called for by the subpoena issued by Dunns Committee to Enron Corp and by the California AGs subpoenas to Enron Energy Services Peter Meringolo and Amanda Smith are leading this effort at our office This is our report on the status of this document identification and our plans subject to your direction to continue this effort next week The last section of the memo poses certain logistical questions and issues regarding the production to Dunns Committee that Mike Kirby should address as soon as possible I Status of EES Response to Subpoena from AG As we previously reported we have completed a preliminary investigation of documents in the EESs offices in California which are responsive to the subpoena from the attorney general Below is a report of documents collected documents we need to collect soon and action items which we still need to do in order to identify responsive documents A Documents Collected We have copies of the following documents Contracts from the San Ramon office Contracts and documents relating to the contracts from Costa Mesa office B Documents to Collect We previously identified the following relevant documents However we have not yet collected them into one central location Documents related to the returning customers to the Utilities These documents are on Mojgan Ahads hard drive in files labeled California Rapid Response and California Strike Force and email Golden Bear documents in San Ramon Costa Mesa and Long Beach Files related to status of EDIs re return of customers to PGE Presently kept by Summer Intern Kerri Bernstein Documents related to the returning customers to the Utilities These documents are on Mojgan Ahads hard drive in files labeled California Rapid Response and California Strike Force and email Golden Bear documents in San Ramon Costa Mesa and Long Beach Files related to status of EDIs re return of customers to PGE Presently kept by Summer Intern Kerri Bernstein Documents related to each contract in the possession of each account manager in San Ramon Current and Old Organization charts C Action Items To complete our review of the relevant documents in California we plan to do the following Review emails and hard drives of Tom Riley Dirk van Ulden Mojgan Ahad and Jim Wright Interview and review documents in the possession of Originators in Long Beach II Status of Enron Corporations Response to Subpoena from Senator Dunn We are prepared to produce more than pages of documents to the Sacramento repository on Monday in response to the subpoena from Senator Dunn This memorandum sets forth the remaining issues to be resolved before Enrons production of documents in California is complete This memorandum is divided into three sections substantive issues to be resolved documents remaining to be reviewed and logistical issues to be addressed by Mike Kirby A Substantive Issues We have prepared and sent to Mike Kirby and Richard Sanders and others a packet of documents which we need to discuss as soon as possible We need guidance about whether we ought to produce these types of documents These documents include Bids made to DWR ISO The subpoena calls for bids made to the ISO and PX and we assume that this means bid data However Enron did submit bids to provide for Summer Reliability Generation and to provide energy to the DWR Should we produce these documents Enron Business Plans These documents talk in general terms about strategies for developing revenue in California not necessarily forecasts of revenue These documents fall on the fringe of what has been asked for by the subpoena Siting Generation Development documents This is a broad category of documents which are irrelevant to the Senate investigation However if the subpoena is broadly and perhaps fairly read many documents within this category may be responsive Our suggestion is to carve out these documents and let the Senate Committee know that we are doing so For example Dunn asks for information about generation units owned or controlled by Enron We found documents in which Enron controlled the development of the unit but then sold it to a third party Likewise Enron is involved in a project to expand Las Vegas CoGen facility Many of these documents contain financial data such as supply and demand curves and pricing data in order to analyze whether to go forward with the project We have numerous proposal and drafts but not finalized deals in which negotiated to act as scheduling coordinators or to buy the energy from the facility These drafts are not called for by the subpoena but documents related to final contracts are We have gathered documents related to negotiations with QFs to serve as Scheduling Coordinators which apparently coincide with divestiture by the utilities Documents related to meetings of the Independent Energy Producers IEP trade association These documents clearly are responsive Many however contain sensitive and privilege information including information about lobbying efforts Thus we need to provide notice to the IEP that we are required to produce these documents and give them an opportunity to review these documents before we produce them Additionally we should contact their counsel to see what if anything has already been produced I assume that they have been subpoenaed B Enron Corp Documents in San Francisco yet to be Reviewed We have almost completed our review of potentially responsive materials maintained in the San Francisco office We will complete this review next week and produce any additional documents to the repository The following is a list of the remaining materials to be reviewed Electronic documents on Sue Maras hard drive Email messages maintained by Dave Parquet Mike McDonald and Sue Mara Interview Mike McDonald Review addition materials relating to QFs recently located by Enron C Logistical Issues and Questions for Mike Kirby Delivering boxes to Sacramento repository We need someone to drive the boxes to Sacramento and obtain a key for the repository space Bob Webb a senior paralegal has volunteered if we need him to go Staffing the Sacramento repository We assume that we will need a proctor when the Senate Committee reviews the documents Can we work out a schedule or protocol with them Moreover we will need to have someone drive to Sacramento each time we produce documents We cannot simply federal express or messenger the documents because there is no one to receive them Confidential Stamping We have not marked anything Confidential Should we do that now or should we wait until the Senate selects documents for copying Privilege Log We will begin creating a privilege log next week When do we need to have it completed This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and privileged information Any

Original Message From Molland Michael E ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESMollandCMichaelEECMMollandbrobeckEcomE NRONcom Sent Friday June PM To Williams Robert C Subject FW Meetings with EES officers in San Ramon and Costa Mesa regard ing California AG subpoena Original Message From Molland Michael E Sent Friday June PM To Cc Fergus Gary S Smith Amanda D Meringolo Peter Subject Meetings with EES officers in San Ramon and Costa Mesa regarding California AG subpoena We met and talked to EES officers this week on three occasions to identify the documents called for by the AGs subpoena that reside within California This memo discusses those three meetings I SUMMARY The following people attended these meetings Conference Call M Molland A Smith J Wright T Reilly D van Ulden R Williams Meeting at EES San Ramon M Molland A Smith P Meringolo D van Ulden T Reilly J Eastlund M Ahad Meeting at EES Costa Mesa A Smith J Wright T Taylor General Conclusions It appears that while there may be a large volume of responsive documents in both San Ramon SR and Costa Mesa CM perhaps as much as boxes in each office depending on how broadly we construe the requests for information for EESs communications regarding decisions to switch customers back to the utilities there are relatively few highly sensitive internal Enron documents which could be used to evidence the alleged antitrust violations or pricegouging However many of the documents may contain proprietary customer information In all of our meetings with EES personnel we emphasized what constitutes a responsive document from a territorial perspective ie only documents in hard copy form in SR or CM or in electronic form on the SR or CM servers It appears that many account managers regularly download and print documents from the Document data base housed in Houston or the EES intranet Going forward it will important to emphasize that in collecting documents for possible production EES personnel should not download from these sources We also emphasized that EES personnel should not currently be physically collecting documents rather they should be assessing what sensitive documents exist locating responsive documents and NOT deleting or destroying responsive material Mojhan Ahad and Tamara Taylor Admins assigned to D van Ulden and J Wright respectively will be coordinating any document production that becomes necessary It appears that a slightly different approach may be necessary to recover responsive documents in SR and CM The account managers in CM appear to have more independence with respect to managing their accounts It may be necessary to speak with them directly In SR it appears that it may be possible to collect the large majority of responsive documents directly from Tom Dirk and Mojhan Other than the personnel at SR and CM there are other EES personnel in California that we may need to meet Specifically Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich with regulatory affairs in San Francisco and several Originators in Long Beach and possibly in Northern California who work from home This latter group may be particularly important as they appear to have some account management responsibility on natural gas accounts and most likely have some responsive documents It is unclear the extent to which the subpoena is common knowledge Dirk and Tom in SR stated that they had not revealed its existence to their staff In CM Jim had told his staff about the existence of the subpoena but had not told them who it was from or what it referenced If we proceed with the collection of responsive documents we will need to develop a policy with respect to the confidentiality of the subpoena It appears based on conversations with Jim in CM that although general power point presentations are made up for meetings with customers in Houston apparently each account manager may change or focus the presentation for a specific customer Therefore each presentation will constitute a different document and must be produced separately Note on California Crisis database Golden Bear and the deDASR documents These documents are probably the most sensitive but many may be protected on attorneyclient litigation or settlement privilege grounds There are four Golden Bear team members in California Tom Dirk Jim and George Waidelich It seems in SR the Golden Bear documents are only in the possession of Dirk and Tom However in CM account managers may have some access to them II Recommendations Going Forward Collect and assess most sensitive documents These would include the Golden Bear and deDASR documents These should be collected next week in order to begin a legal analysis of privilege issues In SR this collection can most likely be done by Mojhan In CM it may be necessary to interview individual account managers Meet with floating Originators in Long Beach and potentially in Northern California to assess if they possess any responsive documents A brief conversation with the San Francisco Regulatory Affairs people Sue and Jeff and with George Waidelich would also be warranted This should also be done immediately Meet with Tamara and Mojhan to develop a strategy for locating and copying responsive hard copy documents This is underway Copy the hard drive folders of key personnel onto CDs These folders can then be reviewed for responsive documents by Brobeck attorneys if a production becomes necessary Assess the extent to which responsive data may reside in archival storage sites eg Iron Mountain in CM Because it may be timeconsuming to retrieve documents from these sites we should know now whether that will be necessary Assess the potential implications of the EES intranet on our production obligations Begin developing a legal strategy to protect documents that are not privileged but contain confidential proprietary customer information Ensure document retention policy for appropriate personnel is in place DISCUSSION OF SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS ORGANIZATION AND RETRIEVAL PLAN III Mail and Data Storage Generally During our conversation with Jon Eastlund Manager for SR and CM email servers and Pete Vandegon Manager for SR and CM data servers we discussed the email and document retention policies Each document has its own server located at its California office Email remains on the server until it is deleted by EES user EES user can also move email onto their hard drive and delete from the server Every day from Monday to Thursday a snapshot is taken of the email servers and is preserved on tapes at approximately pm When this snapshot is taken the corresponding day in the previous week is erased and written over Therefore at pm on Wednesday the snapshot of the previous Wednesday is written over Similarly each Friday a snapshot of the server is taken writing over the Friday tape of the previous month In other words there exists at any time a daily snapshot of the past week and a weekly snapshot of the last month Therefore if an email is received on a Tuesday and deleted on a Wednesday that email would appear in the Tuesday daily snapshot which would be preserved until the following Tuesday but would not appear on the weekly snapshot As of J Eastlund is no longer overwriting daily or weekly tapes and is making new tapes going forward He was instructed to keep all backup copies now in existence Pete Vandegon is sending information via email on the data retention system but as of is no longer overwriting as part of the backup process IV Discussion of Responsive Documents by Subpoena Document Request Contracts There will obviously be a great number of these contracts only a few of which are in the public domain and we will need to collect the contracts from both CM and SR as there appears to be little overlap in their files During production it will be extremely important to emphasize to EES personnel not to download contracts from the Houston based Documentum database the typical procedure Forward Contracts looking forward Personnel in SR and CM are convinced that all of these contracts are housed in Houston or housed in California with another Enron entity However Jim suggested that we check with the floating Originators regarding this category Forward Contracts looking backwards Personnel in SR and CM are convinced that all of these contracts are housed in Houston or housed in California with another Enron entity However Jim suggested that we check with the floating Originators regarding this category Documents Sufficient to Identify Each Purchase of Electricity or Ancillary Services SR and CM have no involvement with purchasing and therefore responsive documents would be in Houston Again however it appears that the floating Originators may have some responsive information Documents re Portfolio of Electricity Supply Sources There appear to be very few responsive documents Some customers receive an annual report of the makeup of their power supply eg green power hydro etc but the reports are not particularized they do not list where the hydro came from etc There may also be power point presentations to customers or correspondence with customers about sourcing of electricity Documents re Electricity Purchase Risk Assessment Potentially the Golden Bear and UCCSU documents are responsive here There is at least one power point presentation on the risks associated with relying on the PX and possibly other presentations to customers on market conditions Documents re Strategies or Business Plans The Golden Bear documents are potentially responsive but generally SR and CM were not involved in this kind of strategizing Documents and communications relating to the deDASR It may be possible to read this narrowly and limit it to documents regarding the decision to deDASR All evidence suggests that this decision was made in Houston and SR and CM were not involved Read broadly this request and and would encompass a large number of documents including all communications with customers re the decision and possibly a number of power point presentations on the changing market conditions perhaps created by the Value Enhancement Group in Houston For categories Dirk suggests that we consider whether documents and communications about billing complications would be covered If so the volume of documents increases dramatically See above See above Documents re Causes of Price Increases Several responsive power point presentations on market conditions Internal documents including weekly reports by Paul Smith from November February and possibly emails relating to UCCSU Documents re Revenue Maximizing Strategies The Golden Bear documents are responsive here as well as a few documents in the nature of pitches to clients in CM Documents re Sales of Electricity No responsive documents in SR or CM Contracts Prematurely Terminated It appears that there are currently are none although that may change going forward on the electricity side Several contracts may have been terminated but it was due to default by the customer and therefore wasnt premature On the natural gas side there may be prematurely terminated contracts This question should be put to the floating Originators Note this request goes back to See Org Charts Easy to collect and uncontroversial Documents re Risk Management of Trading Activities Few responsive documents possibly only the Golden Bear documents Org Charts Risk Management See except this request is phrased poorly and we may be able to produce nothing here as the charts have never been organized in the way the AG suggests Documents re Development of Charters and Risk Management Objectives Few responsive documents possibly only Golden Bear documents Documents re Natural Gas positions No responsive documents in CM or SR This question should be put to the Originators See IV Specific Hard Copy Documents Identified in San Ramon as potentially responsive Backup tapes from email servers for May June and In Houston a set of backup tapes from California email servers from December Billing documents One binder containing Top contracts Five CD set dated July containing EEMC contracts and correspondence Electronic version of documents related to the returning customers to the Utilities These documents are on Mojgan Ahads Dirks administrative assistant hard drive in files labeled California Rapid Response and California Strike Force These documents include Form letters Lists of all meters at all customers QAs EDI forms Power Point Presentation Reports of status distributed daily by email created by Peter Vint originally and Mojgan Ahad Mojgan has emails on hard drive re Golden Bear this file I believe contains emails sent on behalf of Chris Holmes CA Strike Force which contains the reports re return of customers which were distributed to people in Houston and California from February to April Files related to status of EDIs re return of customers to PGE Presently kept by Summer Intern Kerri Bernstein Original signed documents related to the returning of customers to utilities may be with Doug Hoth and Tom Reilly and maybe with other account managers Each account manager has hard copy files of documents related to each contract including the contract itself and likely has electronic files containing emails re each account This is based upon my quick review of the files of two managers Shawn Green and Jim Kuegle There is no standardized companywide policy about files nor is there a central filing system A few boxes of former account managers However documents related to specific accounts were distributed to the new account managers The hard drives of the former account managers were deleted but Mojgan believes that the important emails were forwarded to the new account managers A few boxes from other contracts acquired from PGE Energy Trading Current and Old Organization charts There may be relevant documents located in San Francisco especially related to contracts for the purchase of energy V Description of Electronic Documents located in San Ramon EES in San Ramon utilizes three types of servers Mail Servers Data Servers and Web Servers For the purpose of the subpoena we focused on the mail servers and data servers A Mail Servers EES employees in San Ramon and Costa Mesa use Microsoft Outlook on three exchange servers located in California John Eastland is the administrator for this server EES employees outside California use Lotus Notes The Lotus Notes servers are located in Houston TX The retention policy for the exchange servers located in California was as follows Each day Monday through Thursday is copied and saved on a tape for one week Each week the tape is overwritten Each Friday is copied and saved for weeks Thus as of yesterday EES had backup tapes for W Th M and T and for Fridays and Apparently a set of backup tapes were sent to Houston TX at the end of December for an FCC investigation Going forward EES will retain backup tapes for each day until instructed otherwise Backup tapes are made at pm Email messages that remain on the server at that time are copied Email messages that have been deleted or moved onto a persons individual hard drive are not saved Currently there is no policy for retaining emails We have told Tim Reilly and Dirk Van Ulden to retain their emails and to identify any other persons who should do so B Data Servers Electronic documents are maintained on two data servers One in San Ramon EES SROFS one in Costa Mesa EES HOUCM Generally speaking documents on the H and J drives appear to be maintained on these servers The IT person in Houston Pete will provide us with the retention policy regarding these two servers EES has Windows NT servers and UNIX servers Employees in California access the servers located in Houston although it is unclear how many employees do so This much is known Mojgan has access to a program called Documentum which is an online document storage program located on a Houston server All account managers have access to CMS Customer Management System located on Houston servers This contains account information service requests information on customer visits etc Malcom Adkins has access to materials related to marketing located on Houston servers If a person leaves California and relocates to Houston or vice versa that person continues to have access to servers in California and vice versa Project managers and developers have access to Expedition and SureTrack applications located on Houston servers Other persons may have there computers mapped to Houston servers but IT would need to look at each persons computers to find out who does andor John Eastland would need to look at requests for access to those servers VI Summary of the Return of the Customers to the Utilities According to Mojgan the decision to return customers to the utilities was made by people in Houston She knows of no documents relating to that decision However the documents relating to the execution of the return of customers are on Mojgans hard drive There is no file containing copies of the original letters which were sent although Tom Reilly and Doug Hoth may have saved a copy A copy of the letter sent to UC is attached to the Reilly declaration EES called this project either California Strike Force or California Rapid Response In February people from Houston arrived in California and conducted the return of the customers by making calls sending letters etc Most of the calls were made by Houston people Some calls were made by California personnel Doug Hoth and Renee Lazure Peter Vint remained in California for two weeks creating and sending status reports He left and Mojgan continued to create and distribute the status reports This

September PM To Sharp Vicki Delainey David Cc Haedicke Mark E Whalley Greg Dietrich Janet Leff Dan Jim NRON Sanders Richard B Subject RE California AGs InvesigatorGray Davis Customer Contact We are considering four courses of action a suit against Gray Davis for tortious interference with contract a suit for an injuntion against the AG a letter of to our customers and a letter to the press from one of our customers California counsel is researching whether under California law state officials can be sued for tortious conduct The answer depends upon whether the State has waived its sovereign immunity that would normally protect it from such suits We may not have a definitive answer to this question until Monday If California law does provide for such a waiver we could sue the Governor and the State for tortious interference with conduct An additional obstacle to enjoining the AG is that the California statutes give the AG broad authority as to how he conducts an investigation Still if we can get evidence that the AGs investigator is making untrue or misleading statements or engaging in some other misconduct we would need an affidavit from a customer as proof we could go into court to complain that the AG is abusing his authority A letter to our customers could cause Davis and Lockyer to back off Neither wants negative reports about them circulating among California businessmen who they primarily see as potential campaign contributors The letter would lay out the truth about the California energy crisis and DavisLockyers misguided and politicallymotivated search for a scapegoat We could perhaps use Judge Kobayashis statement in the Dunn subpoena proceeding that the California energy crisis was created in part by all arms of the California government to support our case We could also use published reports if verifiable about the DWRs imprudent purchases of power and cast the AGs investigation as an attempt to divert attention from DavisLockyers lack of any success in addressing the the crisis We could thank our customers for not being swayed by the demagogery and rhetoric and for continuing to be our business partners We would want this to be positive in tone A fourth response would be a letter from one or more of our customers to a newspaper complaining about the harassment by the AGs office This letter could make some of the same points as the letter from us to our customers We are still thinking of other approaches We will have the answers to the legal questions buttoned up by Monday at the latest Please call me with any questions or
