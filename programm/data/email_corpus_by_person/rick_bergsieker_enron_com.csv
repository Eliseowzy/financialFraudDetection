past few days This one captures the essence of most of them See in particular the part I have highlighted General reaction in the business community is that Enron must be crazy to have worked this hard to beat the competition only to withdraw just as the project becomes real The phones continue to ring constantly At the same time we have just received the official notification from the Saudis that we have been awarded after what is being described as fierce competition a piece of Core Venture We have already wired this with Oxy and will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships that we have built with the Saudisbut the timing exactly the same time that we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for Dabhol does not help As you might expect the mood in the office is terriblethe team is proud of the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished the impossible against great odds beating the competition in Dolphin Saudi SADAF and Oman as well as putting together a worldclass LNG supply system for Dabhol only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited redeployment potential and little PRC support because of the ex EI stigma Over the next several days we must work through the UOG Dolphin press announcements Saudi we must notify Saudi of our intentions by Wednesday explanations regarding Dolphin to all of those that have helped us eg US embassy and our local sponsors and as luck would have it the Dubai government wants to proceed with the Jebel Ali Aluminumelectricity deal I suspect that they will change their mind over the next several days as events unfold In addition we have employee meetings on Tuesday to reduce the size of the DubaiHouston team from to The next several days are not going to be fun Rick Forwarded by Rick BergsiekerENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Jeffrey Hammad AM To Rick BergsiekerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Maurizio La NoceENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Rob StewartENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Kevin RuffcornENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Pete nron Daniella NRON cc Jackie CT Mac McClellandENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Article Firms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi Firms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi The Oil Daily c Energy Intelligence Group All rights reserved Its all go in Abu Dhabi where Enrons decision to sell its stake in the Dolphin group has opened the door for other oil companies to join the billion project to pipe natural gas from Qatar to the United Arab Emirates UAE At the same time the oilrich emirate has launched a tender to sell of Zakum Development Co Zadco which is producing barrels per day from the offshore Upper Zakum field Total Fina Elf Exxon Mobil Royal DutchShell and BP have been invited to bid and a decision is expected at the beginning of next year Having been in the cards for a long time Enrons littlenoticed withdrawal from Dolphin was made official about three weeks ago when it gave the mandatory day notice to its two partners in the consortium Total and UAE Offsets Group UOG Total and UOG will formally announce the news at a press conference in Abu Dhabi on May EIG understands Enrons share of Dolphin will be sold back to UOG which is headed by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nayhan who is a UAE Armed Forces chief and a key figure in the Abu Dhabi ruling family UOG already holds of the project and will then sell whatever portion of its aggregated stake it likes Total which will operate the upstream side of the project in Qatar retains its interest Who else will join is a matter of wild speculation but there is certainly no shortage of interested parties The whole industry wants to get involved a source close to the project said Among the chasing pack Conoco is making a strong pitch to join Dolphin which would compliment its assets in Dubai where it is operator of bd Dubai Petroleum Co consolidating its position in the Gulf Occidental which like Conoco has no presence in Abu Dhabi is also sniffing around And then there are the heavyweights Exxon Shell and BP all of which are interested and have the advantage of having been in Abu Dhabis oil sector for more than years I think well see a veritable feeding frenzy said one analyst in the region There are all kind of oily types coming to Abu Dhabi After the Enron experience UOGs priority will be to find a partner that is reliable and seems unlikely to be taken over by a larger company during the course of the year project people familiar with the company say This line of thinking would appear to favor the super majors although smaller players may have more to gain and thus more to offer The Dolphin departure ends an unhappy chapter for Enron in the Gulf and is part of the groups strategy to divest some of its overseas assets Enron seemed unable to decide what it wanted to do in Qatar At first it planned to sell liquefied natural gas LNG to Israel then it switched its attention to selling LNG to India By the time it joined Dolphin two years ago Enron had made several enemies in Qatar who would not forgive it for commitments that were never fulfilled Ironically Enron has pulled out of Dolphin just when the project looks certain to go ahead In March the partners signed the crucial term sheet for the billion upstream part of the project which calls for the production of billion cubic feet of gas per day from Qatars giant North field The deal is due to be finalized by autumn Dolphin is on course to deliver the first volumes of Qatari gas to Abu Dhabi in Abu Dhabi is also pushing ahead with its plan to sell of Zadco which is owned by state oil company Adnoc and by Japan Oil Development Co Zadco is a longrunning saga In October was due to be sold to BP and to Total but for reasons known only to itself the Supreme Petroleum Council decided against the idea Paul Sampson c Copyright The Oil Daily Co For more infomation call in US or outside US

<13466344.1075843912480.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,rick.bergsieker@enron.com,2000-12-20 01:04:00,Your Meeting with Oxy Cc that you will be meeting with Dale Lawrence and Casey Olson from Oxy on Thursday and that Terry will be briefing you on the Saudi project opportunities first thing Thursday am and will be participating with you in the meeting After rereading the Saudi proposals today I offer the following thoughts and suggestions for your meeting Terry can fill you in on more details Background The Saudi Gas initiative was kicked off by the Crown Prince during a visit to the US in the fall of The intent was to encourage foreign investors to bring capital and technology into the country to build a privatized gas power and water infrastructure system and to create jobs and investment opportunities for Saudis The initiative is being led by the Foreign Minister because the Crown Prince is aware of resistance from Aramco the Oil Ministry Saudi Electric Co and Saudi Water Co In spite of continuing resistance from these very powerful groups the initiative is moving forward essentially on schedule When the initiative was first announced Enron tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that we would not qualify because we did not have adequate international upstream expertise At the same time Oxy tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that they did not have adequate downstreaminfrastructure expertise Oxy approached us to form a partnership which we did in good faith but with no written agreement We still have not signed an agreement with Oxy but we have traded many drafts and are within days of executing an agreed MOU We have been working together in good faith on orally agreed terms consistent with the draft MOU Oxy and Enron are a good fit because Oxy shares many of the Enron values urgency bottomline focus objective is money not necessarily booked reserves etc Oxy has made it clear that they are primarily interested in upstream investment in Saudi and we have made it clear that we are not interested in upstream investment Oxy understands the recent changes in philosophy in Enron and is ok with this but at the same time they are worried that we may not want to put any capital in Saudi and thus could jeopardize Oxys competitiveness in the upcoming beauty pageant Oxy maintains that throughout the process Dr Iranis personal friendship with the Saudi Foreign Minister has been a big driving force in moving our proposals forward There is probably some truth to this However at the same time it is clear to both Oxy and to Enron that the Saudi bureaucracy is more intrigued with Enron than with Oxy and want to find a role for us Since all of our presentations to the Saudis have been joint OxyEnron presentations the Saudis view us as linked together This is a huge deal for Oxy and the dream of a lifetime for Irani They are afraid that if Enron drops out which we have the clear right to do the Saudis may disqualify Oxy I believe that their fears are justifiedI cant imagine the Saudis allowing Oxy to proceed alone without Enron Proposed Way Forward We and Oxy have been shortlisted along with several other oil companies for two projects Core Project which is an E P opportunity on the Red Sea coast near Jordan combined with a gasliquids processing plant a pipeline a potential powerwater plant and a potential petrochemicals facility The market area on the Red Sea coast has huge growth potential Core Project which is an E P opportunity in SE Saudi near the UAE border combined with a pipeline to eastern Saudi a liquids plant and several potential downstream facilities There is the potential to export this gas to the UAEDolphin but it is a long shot Terry can give you details on both of these proposed projects Each of these projects will require several billion dollars of capital and they each have large upstream components The marketing network potential both within Saudi and internationally is huge but the dilemma is to carve out a role for Enron that fits with our corporate philosophy I understand that Dale Lawrence has proposed to you that we tell the Saudis that OxyEnron want to proceed as joint partners and then settle up behind the veil such that the upstream capital and risk are Oxy responsibilities I dont like this approach because the press wont see beyond the veil and will report it as Enron being a partner in one or two billion deals in Saudi On the other hand I want to be in these projects because the potential in Saudi is huge and the EGM spinoffs liquids etc could also be huge I believe that there is a simple way to address both our needs and Oxys needs The Saudi proposals break both Core Project and Core Project into two pieces an upstream E P and gas processing venture under a traditional PSC arrangement with Aramco as the controlling partner and the foreign partner as operator and various downstream pipeline power water and potentially distribution companies in which Aramco will not be a participant but that other Saudi investors may want a piece of These downstream ventures will buy gas from the upstream ventures and will be subject to pipeline and privatisation regulatory regimes that have not yet been invented I suggest that we propose to the Saudis that Enron and Oxy will be working as partners but that Oxy will be the sole investor and operator for all upstream components Enron on the other hand will undertake to be the developer and operator for the pipelines and downstream facilities but will structure such projects as opportunities for various Saudi investors supported by Project financing and with IPOs as soon as possible In structuring such projects Enron would work with the Saudi government to develop appropriate regulatory regimes Enron as developer and operator would forego the right to any equity in such projects in order to maximize the investment opportunities for Saudis but would instead cover its development costs and earn a profit via operating and development fees to the downstream ventures and success fees at financial close andor other milestones This approach would give Oxy the hard capital investment in Saudi that they want while giving Enron the opportunity to earn a return on intellectual capital It would give us the chance that we want for a dialogue with the Saudis to define the basis for a robust marketoriented systemsimilar to the opportunity that Enron Japan hopes to develop through working with the Japanese government It would also give us an on the ground relationship with government authorities that control policies for the export and marketing of Saudis crudes and liquids We could also offer to be the exporterofftaker for any liquids produced by Oxy Terry and Rob are going to kick this around a bit tonight and may have a more well thought out approach by Thursday but I wanted to get these basic thoughts to you to give you Terry and Rob some food for thought Rick

<26692747.1075843939343.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,rick.bergsieker@enron.com,2000-12-20 01:04:00,Your Meeting with Oxy Cc that you will be meeting with Dale Lawrence and Casey Olson from Oxy on Thursday and that Terry will be briefing you on the Saudi project opportunities first thing Thursday am and will be participating with you in the meeting After rereading the Saudi proposals today I offer the following thoughts and suggestions for your meeting Terry can fill you in on more details Background The Saudi Gas initiative was kicked off by the Crown Prince during a visit to the US in the fall of The intent was to encourage foreign investors to bring capital and technology into the country to build a privatized gas power and water infrastructure system and to create jobs and investment opportunities for Saudis The initiative is being led by the Foreign Minister because the Crown Prince is aware of resistance from Aramco the Oil Ministry Saudi Electric Co and Saudi Water Co In spite of continuing resistance from these very powerful groups the initiative is moving forward essentially on schedule When the initiative was first announced Enron tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that we would not qualify because we did not have adequate international upstream expertise At the same time Oxy tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that they did not have adequate downstreaminfrastructure expertise Oxy approached us to form a partnership which we did in good faith but with no written agreement We still have not signed an agreement with Oxy but we have traded many drafts and are within days of executing an agreed MOU We have been working together in good faith on orally agreed terms consistent with the draft MOU Oxy and Enron are a good fit because Oxy shares many of the Enron values urgency bottomline focus objective is money not necessarily booked reserves etc Oxy has made it clear that they are primarily interested in upstream investment in Saudi and we have made it clear that we are not interested in upstream investment Oxy understands the recent changes in philosophy in Enron and is ok with this but at the same time they are worried that we may not want to put any capital in Saudi and thus could jeopardize Oxys competitiveness in the upcoming beauty pageant Oxy maintains that throughout the process Dr Iranis personal friendship with the Saudi Foreign Minister has been a big driving force in moving our proposals forward There is probably some truth to this However at the same time it is clear to both Oxy and to Enron that the Saudi bureaucracy is more intrigued with Enron than with Oxy and want to find a role for us Since all of our presentations to the Saudis have been joint OxyEnron presentations the Saudis view us as linked together This is a huge deal for Oxy and the dream of a lifetime for Irani They are afraid that if Enron drops out which we have the clear right to do the Saudis may disqualify Oxy I believe that their fears are justifiedI cant imagine the Saudis allowing Oxy to proceed alone without Enron Proposed Way Forward We and Oxy have been shortlisted along with several other oil companies for two projects Core Project which is an E P opportunity on the Red Sea coast near Jordan combined with a gasliquids processing plant a pipeline a potential powerwater plant and a potential petrochemicals facility The market area on the Red Sea coast has huge growth potential Core Project which is an E P opportunity in SE Saudi near the UAE border combined with a pipeline to eastern Saudi a liquids plant and several potential downstream facilities There is the potential to export this gas to the UAEDolphin but it is a long shot Terry can give you details on both of these proposed projects Each of these projects will require several billion dollars of capital and they each have large upstream components The marketing network potential both within Saudi and internationally is huge but the dilemma is to carve out a role for Enron that fits with our corporate philosophy I understand that Dale Lawrence has proposed to you that we tell the Saudis that OxyEnron want to proceed as joint partners and then settle up behind the veil such that the upstream capital and risk are Oxy responsibilities I dont like this approach because the press wont see beyond the veil and will report it as Enron being a partner in one or two billion deals in Saudi On the other hand I want to be in these projects because the potential in Saudi is huge and the EGM spinoffs liquids etc could also be huge I believe that there is a simple way to address both our needs and Oxys needs The Saudi proposals break both Core Project and Core Project into two pieces an upstream E P and gas processing venture under a traditional PSC arrangement with Aramco as the controlling partner and the foreign partner as operator and various downstream pipeline power water and potentially distribution companies in which Aramco will not be a participant but that other Saudi investors may want a piece of These downstream ventures will buy gas from the upstream ventures and will be subject to pipeline and privatisation regulatory regimes that have not yet been invented I suggest that we propose to the Saudis that Enron and Oxy will be working as partners but that Oxy will be the sole investor and operator for all upstream components Enron on the other hand will undertake to be the developer and operator for the pipelines and downstream facilities but will structure such projects as opportunities for various Saudi investors supported by Project financing and with IPOs as soon as possible In structuring such projects Enron would work with the Saudi government to develop appropriate regulatory regimes Enron as developer and operator would forego the right to any equity in such projects in order to maximize the investment opportunities for Saudis but would instead cover its development costs and earn a profit via operating and development fees to the downstream ventures and success fees at financial close andor other milestones This approach would give Oxy the hard capital investment in Saudi that they want while giving Enron the opportunity to earn a return on intellectual capital It would give us the chance that we want for a dialogue with the Saudis to define the basis for a robust marketoriented systemsimilar to the opportunity that Enron Japan hopes to develop through working with the Japanese government It would also give us an on the ground relationship with government authorities that control policies for the export and marketing of Saudis crudes and liquids We could also offer to be the exporterofftaker for any liquids produced by Oxy Terry and Rob are going to kick this around a bit tonight and may have a more well thought out approach by Thursday but I wanted to get these basic thoughts to you to give you Terry and Rob some food for thought Rick

past few days This one captures the essence of most of them See in particular the part I have highlighted General reaction in the business community is that Enron must be crazy to have worked this hard to beat the competition only to withdraw just as the project becomes real The phones continue to ring constantly At the same time we have just received the official notification from the Saudis that we have been awarded after what is being described as fierce competition a piece of Core Venture We have already wired this with Oxy and will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships that we have built with the Saudisbut the timing exactly the same time that we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for Dabhol does not help As you might expect the mood in the office is terriblethe team is proud of the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished the impossible against great odds beating the competition in Dolphin Saudi SADAF and Oman as well as putting together a worldclass LNG supply system for Dabhol only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited redeployment potential and little PRC support because of the ex EI stigma Over the next several days we must work through the UOG Dolphin press announcements Saudi we must notify Saudi of our intentions by Wednesday explanations regarding Dolphin to all of those that have helped us eg US embassy and our local sponsors and as luck would have it the Dubai government wants to proceed with the Jebel Ali Aluminumelectricity deal I suspect that they will change their mind over the next several days as events unfold In addition we have employee meetings on Tuesday to reduce the size of the DubaiHouston team from to The next several days are not going to be fun Rick Forwarded by Rick BergsiekerENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Jeffrey Hammad AM To Rick BergsiekerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Maurizio La NoceENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Rob

Dhabi Firms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi The Oil Daily c Energy Intelligence Group All rights reserved Its all go in Abu Dhabi where Enrons decision to sell its stake in the Dolphin group has opened the door for other oil companies to join the billion project to pipe natural gas from Qatar to the United Arab Emirates UAE At the same time the oilrich emirate has launched a tender to sell of Zakum Development Co Zadco which is producing barrels per day from the offshore Upper Zakum field Total Fina Elf Exxon Mobil Royal DutchShell and BP have been invited to bid and a decision is expected at the beginning of next year Having been in the cards for a long time Enrons littlenoticed withdrawal from Dolphin was made official about three weeks ago when it gave the mandatory day notice to its two partners in the consortium Total and UAE Offsets Group UOG Total and UOG will formally announce the news at a press conference in Abu Dhabi on May EIG understands Enrons share of Dolphin will be sold back to UOG which is headed by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nayhan who is a UAE Armed Forces chief and a key figure in the Abu Dhabi ruling family UOG already holds of the project and will then sell whatever portion of its aggregated stake it likes Total which will operate the upstream side of the project in Qatar retains its interest Who else will join is a matter of wild speculation but there is certainly no shortage of interested parties The whole industry wants to get involved a source close to the project said Among the chasing pack Conoco is making a strong pitch to join Dolphin which would compliment its assets in Dubai where it is operator of bd Dubai Petroleum Co consolidating its position in the Gulf Occidental which like Conoco has no presence in Abu Dhabi is also sniffing around And then there are the heavyweights Exxon Shell and BP all of which are interested and have the advantage of having been in Abu Dhabis oil sector for more than years I think well see a veritable feeding frenzy said one analyst in the region There are all kind of oily types coming to Abu Dhabi After the Enron experience UOGs priority will be to find a partner that is reliable and seems unlikely to be taken over by a larger company during the course of the year project people familiar with the company say This line of thinking would appear to favor the super majors although smaller players may have more to gain and thus more to offer The Dolphin departure ends an unhappy chapter for Enron in the Gulf and is part of the groups strategy to divest some of its overseas assets Enron seemed unable to decide what it wanted to do in Qatar At first it planned to sell liquefied natural gas LNG to Israel then it switched its attention to selling LNG to India By the time it joined Dolphin two years ago Enron had made several enemies in Qatar who would not forgive it for commitments that were never fulfilled Ironically Enron has pulled out of Dolphin just when the project looks certain to go ahead In March the partners signed the crucial term sheet for the billion upstream part of the project which calls for the production of billion cubic feet of gas per day from Qatars giant North field The deal is due to be finalized by autumn Dolphin is on course to deliver the first volumes of Qatari gas to Abu Dhabi in Abu Dhabi is also pushing ahead with its plan to sell of Zadco which is owned by state oil company Adnoc and by Japan Oil Development Co Zadco is a longrunning saga In October was due to be sold to BP and to Total but for reasons known only to itself the Supreme Petroleum Council decided against the idea Paul Sampson c Copyright The Oil Daily Co For more infomation call in US or outside US

past few days This one captures the essence of most of them See in particular the part I have highlighted General reaction in the business community is that Enron must be crazy to have worked this hard to beat the competition only to withdraw just as the project becomes real The phones continue to ring constantly At the same time we have just received the official notification from the Saudis that we have been awarded after what is being described as fierce competition a piece of Core Venture We have already wired this with Oxy and will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships that we have built with the Saudisbut the timing exactly the same time that we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for Dabhol does not help As you might expect the mood in the office is terriblethe team is proud of the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished the impossible against great odds beating the competition in Dolphin Saudi SADAF and Oman as well as putting together a worldclass LNG supply system for Dabhol only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited redeployment potential and little PRC support because of the ex EI stigma Over the next several days we must work through the UOG Dolphin press announcements Saudi we must notify Saudi of our intentions by Wednesday explanations regarding Dolphin to all of those that have helped us eg US embassy and our local sponsors and as luck would have it the Dubai government wants to proceed with the Jebel Ali Aluminumelectricity deal I suspect that they will change their mind over the next several days as events unfold In addition we have employee meetings on Tuesday to reduce the size of the DubaiHouston team from to The next several days are not going to be fun Rick Forwarded by Rick BergsiekerENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Jeffrey Hammad AM To Rick BergsiekerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Maurizio La NoceENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Rob

Dhabi Firms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi The Oil Daily c Energy Intelligence Group All rights reserved Its all go in Abu Dhabi where Enrons decision to sell its stake in the Dolphin group has opened the door for other oil companies to join the billion project to pipe natural gas from Qatar to the United Arab Emirates UAE At the same time the oilrich emirate has launched a tender to sell of Zakum Development Co Zadco which is producing barrels per day from the offshore Upper Zakum field Total Fina Elf Exxon Mobil Royal DutchShell and BP have been invited to bid and a decision is expected at the beginning of next year Having been in the cards for a long time Enrons littlenoticed withdrawal from Dolphin was made official about three weeks ago when it gave the mandatory day notice to its two partners in the consortium Total and UAE Offsets Group UOG Total and UOG will formally announce the news at a press conference in Abu Dhabi on May EIG understands Enrons share of Dolphin will be sold back to UOG which is headed by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nayhan who is a UAE Armed Forces chief and a key figure in the Abu Dhabi ruling family UOG already holds of the project and will then sell whatever portion of its aggregated stake it likes Total which will operate the upstream side of the project in Qatar retains its interest Who else will join is a matter of wild speculation but there is certainly no shortage of interested parties The whole industry wants to get involved a source close to the project said Among the chasing pack Conoco is making a strong pitch to join Dolphin which would compliment its assets in Dubai where it is operator of bd Dubai Petroleum Co consolidating its position in the Gulf Occidental which like Conoco has no presence in Abu Dhabi is also sniffing around And then there are the heavyweights Exxon Shell and BP all of which are interested and have the advantage of having been in Abu Dhabis oil sector for more than years I think well see a veritable feeding frenzy said one analyst in the region There are all kind of oily types coming to Abu Dhabi After the Enron experience UOGs priority will be to find a partner that is reliable and seems unlikely to be taken over by a larger company during the course of the year project people familiar with the company say This line of thinking would appear to favor the super majors although smaller players may have more to gain and thus more to offer The Dolphin departure ends an unhappy chapter for Enron in the Gulf and is part of the groups strategy to divest some of its overseas assets Enron seemed unable to decide what it wanted to do in Qatar At first it planned to sell liquefied natural gas LNG to Israel then it switched its attention to selling LNG to India By the time it joined Dolphin two years ago Enron had made several enemies in Qatar who would not forgive it for commitments that were never fulfilled Ironically Enron has pulled out of Dolphin just when the project looks certain to go ahead In March the partners signed the crucial term sheet for the billion upstream part of the project which calls for the production of billion cubic feet of gas per day from Qatars giant North field The deal is due to be finalized by autumn Dolphin is on course to deliver the first volumes of Qatari gas to Abu Dhabi in Abu Dhabi is also pushing ahead with its plan to sell of Zadco which is owned by state oil company Adnoc and by Japan Oil Development Co Zadco is a longrunning saga In October was due to be sold to BP and to Total but for reasons known only to itself the Supreme Petroleum Council decided against the idea Paul Sampson c Copyright The Oil Daily Co For more infomation call in US or outside US

and that Terry will be briefing you on the Saudi project opportunities first thing Thursday am and will be participating with you in the meeting After rereading the Saudi proposals today I offer the following thoughts and suggestions for your meeting Terry can fill you in on more details Background The Saudi Gas initiative was kicked off by the Crown Prince during a visit to the US in the fall of The intent was to encourage foreign investors to bring capital and technology into the country to build a privatized gas power and water infrastructure system and to create jobs and investment opportunities for Saudis The initiative is being led by the Foreign Minister because the Crown Prince is aware of resistance from Aramco the Oil Ministry Saudi Electric Co and Saudi Water Co In spite of continuing resistance from these very powerful groups the initiative is moving forward essentially on schedule When the initiative was first announced Enron tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that we would not qualify because we did not have adequate international upstream expertise At the same time Oxy tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that they did not have adequate downstreaminfrastructure expertise Oxy approached us to form a partnership which we did in good faith but with no written agreement We still have not signed an agreement with Oxy but we have traded many drafts and are within days of executing an agreed MOU We have been working together in good faith on orally agreed terms consistent with the draft MOU Oxy and Enron are a good fit because Oxy shares many of the Enron values urgency bottomline focus objective is money not necessarily booked reserves etc Oxy has made it clear that they are primarily interested in upstream investment in Saudi and we have made it clear that we are not interested in upstream investment Oxy understands the recent changes in philosophy in Enron and is ok with this but at the same time they are worried that we may not want to put any capital in Saudi and thus could jeopardize Oxys competitiveness in the upcoming beauty pageant Oxy maintains that throughout the process Dr Iranis personal friendship with the Saudi Foreign Minister has been a big driving force in moving our proposals forward There is probably some truth to this However at the same time it is clear to both Oxy and to Enron that the Saudi bureaucracy is more intrigued with Enron than with Oxy and want to find a role for us Since all of our presentations to the Saudis have been joint OxyEnron presentations the Saudis view us as linked together This is a huge deal for Oxy and the dream of a lifetime for Irani They are afraid that if Enron drops out which we have the clear right to do the Saudis may disqualify Oxy I believe that their fears are justifiedI cant imagine the Saudis allowing Oxy to proceed alone without Enron Proposed Way Forward We and Oxy have been shortlisted along with several other oil companies for two projects Core Project which is an E P opportunity on the Red Sea coast near Jordan combined with a gasliquids processing plant a pipeline a potential powerwater plant and a potential petrochemicals facility The market area on the Red Sea coast has huge growth potential Core Project which is an E P opportunity in SE Saudi near the UAE border combined with a pipeline to eastern Saudi a liquids plant and several potential downstream facilities There is the potential to export this gas to the UAEDolphin but it is a long shot Terry can give you details on both of these proposed projects Each of these projects will require several billion dollars of capital and they each have large upstream components The marketing network potential both within Saudi and internationally is huge but the dilemma is to carve out a role for Enron that fits with our corporate philosophy I understand that Dale Lawrence has proposed to you that we tell the Saudis that OxyEnron want to proceed as joint partners and then settle up behind the veil such that the upstream capital and risk are Oxy responsibilities I dont like this approach because the press wont see beyond the veil and will report it as Enron being a partner in one or two billion deals in Saudi On the other hand I want to be in these projects because the potential in Saudi is huge and the EGM spinoffs liquids etc could also be huge I believe that there is a simple way to address both our needs and Oxys needs The Saudi proposals break both Core Project and Core Project into two pieces an upstream E P and gas processing venture under a traditional PSC arrangement with Aramco as the controlling partner and the foreign partner as operator and various downstream pipeline power water and potentially distribution companies in which Aramco will not be a participant but that other Saudi investors may want a piece of These downstream ventures will buy gas from the upstream ventures and will be subject to pipeline and privatisation regulatory regimes that have not yet been invented I suggest that we propose to the Saudis that Enron and Oxy will be working as partners but that Oxy will be the sole investor and operator for all upstream components Enron on the other hand will undertake to be the developer and operator for the pipelines and downstream facilities but will structure such projects as opportunities for various Saudi investors supported by Project financing and with IPOs as soon as possible In structuring such projects Enron would work with the Saudi government to develop appropriate regulatory regimes Enron as developer and operator would forego the right to any equity in such projects in order to maximize the investment opportunities for Saudis but would instead cover its development costs and earn a profit via operating and development fees to the downstream ventures and success fees at financial close andor other milestones This approach would give Oxy the hard capital investment in Saudi that they want while giving Enron the opportunity to earn a return on intellectual capital It would give us the chance that we want for a dialogue with the Saudis to define the basis for a robust marketoriented systemsimilar to the opportunity that Enron Japan hopes to develop through working with the Japanese government It would also give us an on the ground relationship with government authorities that control policies for the export and marketing of Saudis crudes and liquids We could also offer to be the exporterofftaker for any liquids produced by Oxy Terry and Rob are going to kick this around a bit tonight and may have a more well thought out approach by Thursday but I wanted to get these basic thoughts to you to give you Terry and Rob some food for thought Rick
