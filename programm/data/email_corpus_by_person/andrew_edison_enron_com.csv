the Texas Lawyer as one of the best lawyers in the state under the age of More details below Read the email Know anyone at Enron who would be interested Andy Original Message From Heather Way ENRON Sent Mon PM To Edison Andrew Cc Subject RE follow up Hi Andy Thank you for the very nice message All is very well in Austin Hows Houston and the horse Hope we can get down to Houston soon Have you gotten to meet Ella yet By the way I finally got to make a CBAR presentation to Bracewell in Houston which Marcy organizated and the firm is now actively involved I really like Marcyshe is very cool Your message reminded me of ENRON and how I have sent a couple of unanswered messages to Jim Derrick at the recommendation of Scott Atlas to see if we can get get Enron attorneys involved andor to get an Enron attorney to serve on our Houston advisory board I believe Scott said he had talked to Jim about years ago about getting Enron to partner with VE attorneys on transactional pro bono matters Scott said Jim sounded interested and suggested I contact him as well What is the current status of pro bono there We work very closely with VE and are still very interested in the partnership model Attached is additional info for corporate counsel and the role they can play in CBAR On the advisory board front we are currently looking for transactional attorneys to serve on a new Houston advisory board for CBAR as well as a newly restructured statewide operating board Would love to have an Enron attorney serve on one of the boards The quick and easy low down is that the advisory board is a very minimal commitment with meetings a year in Houston and the operating board will serve as a more traditional operating board with meetings a year More info is below Any recommendations of Enron attorneys Heres more background on CBAR and the boards Texas Community Building with Attorney Resources Texas CBAR is a statewide pro bono initiative for corporate counsel and other business lawtransactional attorneys The mission of our organization is twofold Empower low income people and strengthen low income neighborhoods in Texas by providing pro bono legal services to communitybased nonprofits in Texas that serve low income individuals and communities with an emphasis on affordable housing development activities and Provide attorneys who have specialized transactional skills with increased opportunities to apply these skills to benefit low income communities Since Texas CBAR was founded in Legal Aid of Central Texas has been our sponsoring organization but Texas CBAR is a statewide project and operates with an independent advisory board Now that Texas CBAR has gotten off the ground we are working on building regional advisory boards as well as a new statewide operating board to help us build on our firstyear successes and explore ways to expand our pro bono opportunities for transactional lawyers Serving on the board of CBAR offers attorneys the opportunity to be part of an exciting innovative project As the only statewide business law project in Texas attorneys who serve on our boards will be able to play an influential role in the future of business law pro

Wietze Original Message From Davis Britt Sent August To Cc Sanders Richard B Edison Andrew Carrier Lee Zikes Becky Rogers Daniel R Henking Paul Dingeldein Wietze Subject RE SANTA CLARA Dear Andrew Thanks for the information from Exmar Wayne Perry our chief business con tact with Exmar recently went on consultant status I will find out Dan can you help who the relationship contact will be going forward and see if that person has any cause for optimism You confirmed that no hearing had been set in this very old maritime arbitr ation which arises out of the loading in Houston Texas almost ten years a go of the SANTA CLARA The ship had been chartered by ELFI from Exmar to l oad a cargo of propane Loading was delayed and less than the full contrac tuallycommitted amount of propane could be loaded We believe that this w as because the ship had to take so much time to cool off its tanks to compr ess the propane even though the propane was delivered at the contractually required temperature Exmar apparently takes the position that this was c aused by the lack of back pressure from the shore tanks In any case Exma r reportedly billed ELFI about in demurrage as a result Part of t his was apparently deadfreight a charge by the ship for ELFI not having av ailable all the product that the ship was supposed to load To add insult to injury ELFI also paid off another ship that was in line to get the SANT A CLARAs berth so that the SANTA CLARA could continue loading and sail wi thin its window of opportunity Based on the foregoing I understand that ELFI has a counterclaim of about You advised that recoverable interest would probably increase the principal of both claims by about You advised that you would send me information regarding your firms time i n this case to date You advised that you estimated ELFI spending an addit ional pounds in this matter assuming that the arbitration la sted two days and that under the normal UK arbitration rules the loser would be responsible for the arbitrators fees and expenses and opposing co unsels fees and expenses You did not agree with Exmars proposal to try this matter solely on the documents given the fact issues as to what cause d the delay in loading although this would reduce trial costs As I mentioned I am by copy of this email asking Wietze Dingeldein Enron s UK demurrage expert to give you a call upon your return August and take a look at your file and give his comments as to the strength of the d emurrage claim Wietze I am thinking particularly about any timebar argum ents but any ammunition you can give us would be helpful Both you and W ietze may want to consider whether the condition of the ship invalidates th e NOR under the Glencore Grain v Flacker Shipping HAPPY DAY decision I am also asking Paul Henking who now works in ENAs Singapore office if he was involved in fixing this ship and remembers anything about it I appreciate your help Britt PS to RichardAndy E which of you should I be reporting to on this one Original Message From mailto Sent Monday August AM To Davis Britt Cc Sanders Richard B Edison Andrew Carrier Lee Zikes Becky Subject SANTA CLARA Dear Britt SANTA CLARA Thanks for your email of th July and I apologise for the slow response As you know we have suggested to Exmars lawyers that in the light of the underlying commercial relationship the parties should consider a straightforward drop hands settlement We have recently finally heard from our opponents who say that whilst they are keen to maintain a good commercial relationship with Enron they nevertheless do wish to obtain an award on this matter They have however suggested that in order to reduce costs the parties proceed with a documents only arbitration Whilst Exmars solicitors are correct in suggesting this would lead to a significant saving in costs I do not consider we should agree to this and that we should have an oral hearing of about days I say this because I think there is a much better prospect of explaining to the arbitrators that this is not a straightforward demurrage dispute if we present our evidence by way of Counsels submissions and expert evidence I would however welcome your views on this I will be out of the office from close of business today until th August and I have arranged to discuss this matter further with Exmars solicitors on my return Kind
