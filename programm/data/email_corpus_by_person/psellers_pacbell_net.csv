<4080959.1075842978080.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,psellers@pacbell.net,2000-09-23 18:31:00,I love you but Im unhappy I just dont want to be criticized anymore The thing is I know you think a lot of it is funny and Ive just lost my sense of humor but the truth is after a while its just not funny anymore Like when you yawned last night when I was telling a story to your friends Yes its funny But when you do it every time after a while it just starts to hurt my feelings Thats just one recent example Youre often telling everybody how neurotic and fucked up I am Or how Im totally overbearing about playing the banjo In fact you just said that today to my friends at Haas Do you know how embarassing that was for me You should listen to yourself when you talk about me in front of your friends or my friends or my family How often do you say nice things and how often do you criticize me Why dont you ask them and see what they have to say Ive tried to talk to you about it I asked you to spend some time trying to say mostly nice things just for a little while But apparantly you either cant or wont and the end result is that I feel like you just dont care Im sure there are things you want me to do Id like to try to do them But I dont know what else I can do to make you understand that I just cant take all the criticism from you anymore It makes me feel like shit I dont know where else to go Jeff I suggested talking to a shrink but youre not willing to do that either Im sure that half of it is my fault and Id like to work on this together but you dont seem to be willing to work on the one thing thats really hurting me and that Ive asked you to work on And maybe that means you need to think about how you really feel

<269093.1075842985619.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,psellers@pacbell.net,2000-10-02 03:25:00,RE Im sorryIm sorry my parents did that last night I will ask them not to do that again And I am not upset about us not getting married or moving in together I would like for our relationship to evolve and grow into something like that All I was saying is that we have a communication problem if you think weve talked about it and I dont think we have If I ever thought you wanted me to move in with you I would have done it That has nothing to do with selling my house But Im not upset about it either You seem to be putting a lot of words in my mouth in this email about what I want that Im not telling you about and none of it is true But most importantly I was NOT calling you a liar or an asshole When I said honest I was talking about being straightforward and communicating in a way that doesnt make me have to guess what youre really saying It had nothing to do with lying and I never accused you of lying I hope you understand that And I certainly never EVER called you an asshole last night Jeff I really dont think this has to be an argument But its very sad to me that you dont think we care enough about each other to be committed to this relationship Thats a pretty serious blow Original Message From mailto Sent Monday October AM To Prentice Sellers Subject Re Im sorry Prentice Im happy to talk However if youre unhappy because I havent asked you to marry me or I havent asked you to move in together or I havent asked you to have children then you need to say so Im very upset to think that the only time I hear what you feel or what your mother believes you feel or what your father believes you feel is when were having dinner with your parents and they impose their limited view of our relationship on the situation Im not interested in debating my personal relationship with you with your parents as a substitute for our communicatingthats not a relationship Nor am I interested in living my life according to what your parents or my parents or anyone elses parents wish theyd done If I had ever had someone call you the way Cameron called me on Saturday night you would have screamed at me for days Yet when its the other way theres always a difference always a reason It seems like rather than communicate we are continually engaged in a rhetorical exercise It s very upsetting and its the sort of oneway street that has me so deeply depressed about how we interact If you feel that Im dishonest or too dominant or not committed to the relationship then you need to say soI shouldnt have to hear it in vague terms from your parents over dinner And if you want to move in together or get married or have children then perhaps it would be constructive for you to say so and offer ways in which we would make that happen From my perspective all youve ever considered is not selling your housefor a variety of reasons that I dont understand or buying another place with Cameron But Im not dating you and your sister Im dating you So it seems to me that if you were committed to it you would search a solution Instead it seems to me none of those things occur but Im an asshole for not having moved in with you or married you or had children with you Thats loselose and everyone can call me an asshole but it wont change things It seems to me that two things have to happen for people to make a commitment First they have to care for each other and the way we interact its hard to say objectively that we pass that hurdle You have frequently asked your parents to stop arguing that it upsets you too much but thats what we spend most of our time doing Second each person has to be emotionally mature enough to undertake the responsibilities that come with the commitment Ive always wanted to be your partner not your older brother and not your father I want an equal partnership where both individuals are pouring into the relationship even when its difficult even when its inconvenient If youre looking for a different dynamic in a relationship then we need to get it clear I dont think we pass these two hurdles and so I dont think were quite ready for the commitment though Ive been working hard at trying to get there and think we could But if were not ready Im not going to do it to please your parents or my parents or anyone else We can talk all day long about what an asshole I am but Im not willing to do that anymore And if thats a requirement then I will fail and we shouldnt waste our time It takes two pure and simple Im very sorry that work is overwhelming right now and that I go to school and am in the process of fulfilling something Ive always wanted to dohave property on the coast If you feel that we cant have the relationship you want or need because of my schedule then you need to tell me If you want to talk about these issues thats great but I just feel that you never said this and no this is what I said and all the spinning and debating is a diversion that doesnt get to the real issues I was very upset that after the conversation we had with your parents which I am very unhappy about you call to me I lied about something After this long if you want to discuss my dishonesty then I think we need to take a hard look at why were in this at all So Im happy to talk but not on the phone and not about whos the bigger asshole or whos a lying sonofabitch

Prentice Sellers Subject RE Im sorry I just feel that things have gotten so bad that maybe its in part a reaction on your part that you dont think Im committed and that hurts too After last nites discussion with your parents thats all that I could surmise I announced to my Corporation that I wouldnt be accepting a promotion because Im committed to you Yet theres no recognition of that whatsoever But even with that commitment I dont think were ready at least not right now but Ive been working toward the time when we are ready But lately it just seems to have deteriorated to a horrible state And Im tired of your Mother making it seem perverse that were not married and I dont need to have her continue repeating it I am also very tired of your Mothers insinuationsand less than insinuations I can talk very comfortably and rationally with your Dad and I value those discussions But your Mothers constant implications that your some big victim and Im a very big asshole has worn very thin and its inappropriate and rude Its particularly troublesome coming from someone with a less than untarnished relationship history As you know I dont react well to dogmatism and preaching Your Dad takes a very different tack Prentice Sellers To ac cc bellnet Subject RE Im sorry PM Jeff Im sorry my parents did that last night I will ask them not to do that again And I am not

us not getting married or moving in together I would like for our relationship to evolve and grow into something like that All I was saying is that we have a communication problem if you think weve talked about it and I dont think we have If I ever thought you wanted me to move in with you I would have done it That has nothing to do with selling my house But Im not upset about it either You seem to be putting a lot of words in my mouth in this email about what I want that Im not telling you about and none of it is true But most importantly I was NOT calling you a liar or an asshole When I said honest I was talking about being straightforward and communicating in a way that doesnt make me have to guess what youre really saying It had nothing to do with lying and I never accused you of lying I hope you understand that And I certainly never EVER called you an asshole last night Jeff I really dont think this has to be an argument But its very sad to me that you dont think we care enough about each other to be committed to this relationship Thats a pretty serious blow Original Message From mailto Sent Monday October AM To Prentice Sellers Subject Re Im sorry Prentice Im happy to talk However if youre unhappy because I havent asked you to marry me or I havent asked you to move in together or I havent asked you to have children then you need to say so Im very upset to think that the only time I hear what you feel or what your mother believes you feel or what your father believes you feel is when were having dinner with your parents and they impose their limited view of our relationship on the situation Im not interested in debating my personal relationship with you with your parents as a substitute for our communicatingthats not a relationship Nor am I interested in living my life according to what your parents or my parents or anyone elses parents wish theyd done If I had ever had someone call you the way Cameron called me on Saturday night you would have screamed at me for days Yet when its the other way theres always a difference always a reason It seems like rather than communicate we are continually engaged in a rhetorical exercise It s very upsetting and its the sort of oneway street that has me so deeply depressed about how we interact If you feel that Im dishonest or too dominant or not committed to the relationship then you need to say soI shouldnt have to hear it in vague terms from your parents over dinner And if you want to move in together or get married or have children then perhaps it would be constructive for you to say so and offer ways in which we would make that happen From my perspective all youve ever considered is not selling your housefor a variety of reasons that I dont understand or buying another place with Cameron But Im not dating you and your sister Im dating you So it seems to me that if you were committed to it you would search a solution Instead it seems to me none of those things occur but Im an asshole for not having moved in with you or married you or had children with you Thats loselose and everyone can call me an asshole but it wont change things It seems to me that two things have to happen for people to make a commitment First they have to care for each other and the way we interact its hard to say objectively that we pass that hurdle You have frequently asked your parents to stop arguing that it upsets you too much but thats what we spend most of our time doing Second each person has to be emotionally mature enough to undertake the responsibilities that come with the commitment Ive always wanted to be your partner not your older brother and not your father I want an equal partnership where both individuals are pouring into the relationship even when its difficult even when its inconvenient If youre looking for a different dynamic in a relationship then we need to get it clear I dont think we pass these two hurdles and so I dont think were quite ready for the commitment though Ive been working hard at trying to get there and think we could But if were not ready Im not going to do it to please your parents or my parents or anyone else We can talk all day long about what an asshole I am but Im not willing to do that anymore And if thats a requirement then I will fail and we shouldnt waste our time It takes two pure and simple Im very sorry that work is overwhelming right now and that I go to school and am in the process of fulfilling something Ive always wanted to dohave property on the coast If you feel that we cant have the relationship you want or need because of my schedule then you need to tell me If you want to talk about these issues thats great but I just feel that you never said this and no this is what I said and all the spinning and debating is a diversion that doesnt get to the real issues I was very upset that after the conversation we had with your parents which I am very unhappy about you call to me I lied about something After this long if you want to discuss my dishonesty then I think we need to take a hard look at why were in this at all So Im happy to talk but not on the phone and not about whos the bigger asshole or whos a lying sonofabitch

Prentice Sellers Subject RE Im sorry I just feel that things have gotten so bad that maybe its in part a reaction on your part that you dont think Im committed and that hurts too After last nites discussion with your parents thats all that I could surmise I announced to my Corporation that I wouldnt be accepting a promotion because Im committed to you Yet theres no recognition of that whatsoever But even with that commitment I dont think were ready at least not right now but Ive been working toward the time when we are ready But lately it just seems to have deteriorated to a horrible state And Im tired of your Mother making it seem perverse that were not married and I dont need to have her continue repeating it I am also very tired of your Mothers insinuationsand less than insinuations I can talk very comfortably and rationally with your Dad and I value those discussions But your Mothers constant implications that your some big victim and Im a very big asshole has worn very thin and its inappropriate and rude Its particularly troublesome coming from someone with a less than untarnished relationship history As you know I dont react well to dogmatism and preaching Your Dad takes a very different tack Prentice Sellers To ac cc bellnet Subject RE Im sorry PM Jeff Im sorry my parents did that last night I will ask them not to do that again And I am not upset about us not getting married or moving in together I would like for our relationship to evolve and grow into something like that All I was saying is that we have a communication problem if you think weve talked about it and I dont think we have If I ever thought you wanted me to move in with you I would have done it That has nothing to do with selling my house But Im not upset about it either You seem to be putting a lot of words in my mouth in this email about what I want that Im not telling you about and none of it is true But most importantly I was NOT calling you a liar or an asshole When I said honest I was talking about being straightforward and communicating in a way that doesnt make me have to guess what youre really saying It had nothing to do with lying and I never accused you of lying I hope you understand that And I certainly never EVER called you an asshole last night Jeff I really dont think this has to be an argument But its very sad to me that you dont think we care enough about each other to be committed to this relationship Thats a pretty serious blow Original Message From mailto Sent Monday October AM To Prentice Sellers Subject Re Im sorry Prentice Im happy to talk However if youre unhappy because I havent asked you to marry me or I havent asked you to move in together or I havent asked you to have children then you need to say so Im very upset to think that the only time I hear what you feel or what your mother believes you feel or what your father believes you feel is when were having dinner with your parents and they impose their limited view of our relationship on the situation Im not interested in debating my personal relationship with you with your parents as a substitute for our communicatingthats not a relationship Nor am I interested in living my life according to what your parents or my parents or anyone elses parents wish theyd done If I had ever had someone call you the way Cameron called me on Saturday night you would have screamed at me for days Yet when its the other way theres always a difference always a reason It seems like rather than communicate we are continually engaged in a rhetorical exercise It s very upsetting and its the sort of oneway street that has me so deeply depressed about how we interact If you feel that Im dishonest or too dominant or not committed to the relationship then you need to say soI shouldnt have to hear it in vague terms from your parents over dinner And if you want to move in together or get married or have children then perhaps it would be constructive for you to say so and offer ways in which we would make that happen From my perspective all youve ever considered is not selling your housefor a variety of reasons that I dont understand or buying another place with Cameron But Im not dating you and your sister Im dating you So it seems to me that if you were committed to it you would search a solution Instead it seems to me none of those things occur but Im an asshole for not having moved in with you or married you or had children with you Thats loselose and everyone can call me an asshole but it wont change things It seems to me that two things have to happen for people to make a commitment First they have to care for each other and the way we interact its hard to say objectively that we pass that hurdle You have frequently asked your parents to stop arguing that it upsets you too much but thats what we spend most of our time doing Second each person has to be emotionally mature enough to undertake the responsibilities that come with the commitment Ive always wanted to be your partner not your older brother and not your father I want an equal partnership where both individuals are pouring into the relationship even when its difficult even when its inconvenient If youre looking for a different dynamic in a relationship then we need to get it clear I dont think we pass these two hurdles and so I dont think were quite ready for the commitment though Ive been working hard at trying to get there and think we could But if were not ready Im not going to do it to please your parents or my parents or anyone else We can talk all day long about what an asshole I am but Im not willing to do that anymore And if thats a requirement then I will fail and we shouldnt waste our time It takes two pure and simple Im very sorry that work is overwhelming right now and that I go to school and am in the process of fulfilling something Ive always wanted to dohave property on the coast If you feel that we cant have the relationship you want or need because of my schedule then you need to tell me If you want to talk about these issues thats great but I just feel that you never said this and no this is what I said and all the spinning and debating is a diversion that doesnt get to the real issues I was very upset that after the conversation we had with your parents which I am very unhappy about you call to me I lied about something After this long if you want to discuss my dishonesty then I think we need to take a hard look at why were in this at all So Im happy to talk but not on the phone and not about
