they need to do when setting up a new commodity Original Message From Wilson Shona Sent Monday October PM To Beck Sally Price Brent A Hall D Todd Cc Apollo Beth Subject Post Mortem on ERMS books not getting into RisktRAC Problem ERMS EGM books were not picked up in RisktRAC due to a mismatch of attributes between ERMS and RisktRAC Root Cause The over riding issue is that the current processes to keep RisktRAC up to date are so manual that the probability of errors such as this occuring are very high point in fact I had people doing this last year and now have managers to support director to support them Specifically what occured in this case is Attribute mismatches happen frequently when there is more than one commodity per in the source system book When setting up new books the book admin must indicate that there is more than one commodity in the book or that the commodity identifier ie BRN has changed to BRNT so Risk Analytics can set up the appropriate number of books there is not a one to one ratio between ERMS books and RistRAC books In this case these books were already being used for BRNT trades At the end of Aug early Sept these books also started being used for BRN and BRCM positions as well The additional usage for these books was not communicated to Risk Analytics therefore no additional books were set up in RisktRAC Additionally there was no effective compensating control for Risk Analytics to catch this problem Procedures to ensure this doesnt happen again Short term Training training sessions for book admins to remind them of RisktRAC requirements pilot class has been taught and first real class is Wednesday of this week Compensating control to be put in place Risk Analytics is creating a role to review all exception reporting available on a daily basis whether a book came from the source system but was not picked up by RisktRAC whether a book was picked up but not included for VAR purposes etc Medium term Greenlight revamping benchmarks to pull from RMS table where data is kept for RisktRAC so the positions per ERMS can be easily reconciled to RisktRAC other projects within RisktRAC being identified Long term Strategic vision of RisktRAC front end all exception reporting needed user requirements being developed Wandas QUs not answered above How long have these books not been in RisktRAC Our best guess is endAugust early Sept when the books started to be used for several commodity types What is the impact on VAR The preliminary VAR for Thursdays trading was million This export did not have the books in it The final VAR for Thursday morning was million The final had about of the books the other four hadnt yet been set up clearly immaterial What was the volume missing K barrels per EGM total positions were mil BBL for Thursdays trading approximatly a bit more material Original Message From Beck Sally Sent Monday October PM To Price Brent A Wilson Shona Subject FW ERMS books not getting into RisktRAC Whats the story on this one Who can best answer the four questions posed by Wanda How soon can we have answers Interestingly I have a PM meeting today with Rick Buy David Port Wanda Curry Bill Bradford and Debbie Brackett rescheduled from last Friday re Project Greenlight due to Buys schedule I would like to be more informed than they are at Thanks Sally Original Message From Curry Wanda Sent Monday October AM To Beck Sally Subject FW ERMS books not getting into RisktRAC Sally FYI This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and the need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on a daily basis Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positions to the source liquids books identify the omitted books and make corrections The total volume difference is million barrels not certain this is accurate but material under any circumstance I am also not certain how long these positions have not been included I believe this issue it limited to VAR only and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the scope of what we need for Project Green Light If you would like to discuss this further let me know I would like to ask for the following how long have these books not been included in RisktRAC what is the impact on total volumes not reported and reason for omission I believe it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy Please let me know what you think Thanks Wanda Original Message From Hagelmann Bjorn Sent Friday
