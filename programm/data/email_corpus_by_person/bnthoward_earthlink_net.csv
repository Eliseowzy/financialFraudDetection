react to this situation I pray they would do the same I pray this is what we are teaching them love and humanity Subject FW Food For Thought Dont look for a punch line There isnt one Read it anyway My question to all of you is Would you have made the same choice At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves learning disabled children the father of one of the students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended After extolling the school and its dedicated staff he offered a question When not interfered with by outside influences everything nature does is done with perfection Yet my son Shay cannot learn things as other children do He cannot understand things as other children do Where is the natural order of things in my son The audience was stilled by the query The father continued I believe that when a child like Shay comes into the world an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself and it comes in the way other people treat that child Then he told the followingstory Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball Shay asked Do you think theyll let me play Shays father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team but the father also understood that if his son were allowed to play it would give him a muchneeded sense of belonging Shays father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play The boy looked around for guidance and getting none he took matters into his own hands and said Were losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning I guess he can be on our team and well try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning In the bottom of the eighth inning Shays team scored a few runs but was still behind by three In the top of the ninth inning Shay put on a glove and played in the outfield Even though no hits came his way he was obviously ecstatic just to be in the game and on the field grinning from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands In the bottom of the ninth inning Shays team scored again Now with two outs and the bases loaded the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat At this juncture let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game Surprisingly Shay was given the bat Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible cause Shay didnt even know how to hold the bat properly much less connect with the ball However as Shay stepped up to the plate the pitcher moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make contact The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly towards Shay As the pitch came in Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game Instead the pitcher took the ball and turned and threw the ball on a high arc to right field far beyond the reach of the first baseman Everyone started yelling Shay run to first Run to first Never in his life had Shay ever made it to first base He scampered down the baseline wideeyed and startled Everyone yelled Run to second run to second By the time Shay rounded first base the right fielder had the ball He could have thrown the ball to the secondbaseman for the tag but he understood the pitchers intentions and intentionally threw the ball high and far over the thirdbasemans head Shay ran toward second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously circled the bases toward home Shay reached second base the opposing shortstop ran to him turned h im in the direction of third base and shouted Run to third As Shay rounded third the boys from both teams were screaming Shay run home Shay ran to home stepped on the plate and was cheered as the hero who hit the grand slam and won the game for his teamThat day said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world AND NOW A LITTLE

make a difference We all have thousands of opportunities every single day to help realize the natural order of things So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a choice Do we pass along a little spark of love and humanity or do we pass up that opportunity and leave the world a little bit colder in the process Do You Yahoo Yahoo Sports oly Coverage of the Olympic
