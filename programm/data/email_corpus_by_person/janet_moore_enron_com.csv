It would certainly make life easier from a compliance standpoint Christian would you run this by your business guys just to make sure that they dont plan to serve small commercials under KW Thanks Janet Forwarded by Janet H MooreHOUECT on AM MDay MSSRcom PM To cc Subject RE Registered versus NonRegistered ESPs in California Janet EPMI originally registered with the CPUC as required because EPMI was the entity who actually contracted with all of Enrons retail customers for service including residential and small commercial as well as larger customers Later EPMI transferred virtually all its customers to EES who was also registered as an ESP Our information is that EPMI still serves at least one industrial customer the Can Fiber plant as well as possibly others We agree that EPMI could reduce its regulatory compliance burdens by deregistering as an ESP so long as it did not intend to serve any customers under kW As I explained EES has occasionally found it necessary to serve customers of less than kW in order to obtain larger accounts This is not a problem with certain chain stores ie a fast food restaurant where several stores are over the kW limit and a few are not In that situation the CPUC has clarified that compliance with the small customer consumer protection rules is not required However EES has also been asked to serve residential customers such as employees and executives in order to get a large customer account We would not advise serving any such customers without a valid ESP registration If as you suggest EPMI isand expects to remain in a position where it will not consent to serve such small customers then deregistration is an option Please let us know if there is anything further we can do to assist you in this matter Mike Day Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday May AM To Cc Subject Registered versus NonRegistered ESPs in California Mike Per my voicemail I am forwarding to you an email from an attorney at LeBoeuf As mentioned LeBoeuf has been helping us develop an overall compliance plan for meeting the varied retail regulatory requirements in the states where EPMI sells to industrials They came up with the suggestion as discussed further below of having EPMI deregister as an ESP in California and instead become a nonregistered ESP I understand that EPMI could still sell to large industrials under this classification First can you remember the historical reason of why EPMI registered as an ESP to begin with but with the qualification that it only intended to serve large industrials There may have been an important strategic decision to do so Second is there any reason why EPMI should not deregister as an ESP and become a nonregistered ESP I look forward to hearing from you Please feel free to call me at Janet Forwarded by Janet H MooreHOUECT on AM JAMES BOOTHE To LGM cc CHRISTOPHER HILEN COM LGMCOM JOHN KLAUBERG LGMCOM JOHN MAAS LGMCOM SANDY COFER LGMCOM Subject Registered versus NonRegistered ESPs in California PM Janet As you know EPMI is currently classified with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC as a Registered ESP ESP EPMI may want to consider deregistering with the CPUC and instead benefit from classification as a NonRegistered ESP I have confirmed that an ESP must only register with the CPUC prior to serving residential and small commercial customers The CPUC defines a small commercial customer as a customer that has a maximum peak demand of less than kW per meter for at least billing periods during the most recent month period See CPUC o h and PGE Tariff Rule As EPMI has indicated in its license application that it only intends to serve large commercial customers and per our discussions does not have immediate plans to serve small commercial customers EPMI may elect to deregister and become a NonRegistered ESP The primary advantage of deregistering is that EPMI as a NonRegistered ESP would no longer have continued reporting and compliance requirements with the CPUC including the annual submission of a standard service plan filing application update and license renewal Additionally as a NonRegistered ESP EPMI would no longer have the ongoing obligation to notify the CPUC within days of changes in address or phone numbers and to notify the CPUC of all other material changes including changes to officers and directors within days I have confirmed with a contact at the energy division of the CPUC on an anonymous basis that a Registered ESP can deregister with the CPUC by sending a letter to the address below requesting cancellation of ESP registration status California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division Electric Service Provider Registration Fourth Floor Van Ness Avenue San Francisco CA Our source at the CPUC also confirmed that the CPUC exercises no regulatory jurisdiction over a NonRegistered ESP NonRegistered ESPs however can file a complaint at the CPUC against a jurisdictional utility over issues dealing with the utilitys compliance with its tariffs with respect to ESPs Please note that while NonRegistered ESPs do not have ongoing reporting and compliance requirements with the CPUC both Registered ESPs and NonRegistered ESPs must submit various environmental compliance filings with the California Energy Commission and if participating in the Greene Program make additional filings with the Center for Resource Solutions For additional information on these reporting and compliance requirements for Registered ESPs and NonRegistered ESPs in California please refer to the LLGM website at
