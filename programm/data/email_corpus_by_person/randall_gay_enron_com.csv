gigging trip On an overcast Sunday night Pooles pickup truck headlights malfunctioned The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had burned out As a replacement fuse was not available Wallis noticed that the caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering wheel column Upon inserting the bullet the headlights again began to operate properly and the two men proceeded on eastbound toward the White River bridge After traveling approximately miles and just before crossing the river the bullet apparently overheated discharged and

debate Randy my oldest son forwarded this to me and based on our political discussions at lunch the other day I thought you would enjoy it Bob Forwarded by Robert SupertyHOUECT on AM Rob Superty on PM To cc Subject Fwd real debate Read this guysits really funny The format isnt exactly pretty but youll be able to figure it out The Real Debate Jim Lehrer Welcome to the second presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov George W Bush The candidates have agreed on these rules I will ask a question The candidate will ignore the question and deliver rehearsed remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters The opponent will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens into voting for him When a speakers time has expired I will whimper softly while he continues to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more minutes Lets start with the vice president Mr Gore can you give us the name of a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that strains the bounds of common sense Gore As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made love the way we have so often during the years of our rocksolid marriage the downtrodden have a clear choice in this election My opponent wants to cut taxes for the richest percent of Americans I on the other hand want to put the richest percent in an iron clad lock box so they cant hurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper who is here tonight Mrs Frampinhamperhas been selling her internal organs one by one to pay for gas so that she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me Also her poodle has arthritis Lehrer Gov Bush your rebuttal Bush Governors are on the front lines every day hugging people crying with them relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists I want to empower those crying people to make their own decisions unlike my opponent whose mother is not Barbara Bush Lehrer Lets turn to foreign affairs Gov Bush if Slobodan Milosevic were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia would you be able to pronounce his name Bush The current administration had eight years to deal with that guy and didnt get it done If Im elected the first thing I would do about that guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies And then Dick would present me several options for dealing with that guy And then Dick would tell me which one to choose You know as governor of Texas I have to make tough foreign policy decisions every day about how were going to deal with New Mexico Lehrer Mr Gore your rebuttal Gore Foreign policy is something Ive always been keenly interested in I served my country in Vietnam I had an uncle who was a victim of poison gas in World War I I myself lost a leg in the FrancoPrussian War And when that war was over I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a way that any undecided woman voter would find romantic If Im entrusted with the office of president I pledge to deal knowledgeably with any threat foreign or domestic by putting it in an iron clad lock box Because the American people deserve a president who can comfort them with simple metaphors Lehrer Vice President Gore how would you reform the Social Security system Gore Its a vital issue Jim Thats why Joe Lieberman and I have proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give to every senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny until the year In addition my budget commits trillion over the next years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them with the childproof cap Lehrer Gov Bush Bush Thats fuzzy math I know because as governor of Texas I have to do math every day I have to add up the numbers and decide whether Im going to fill potholes out on Rt east of Abilene or commit funds to reroof the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds Lehrer Its time for closing statements Gore Im my own man I may not be the most exciting politician but I will fight for the working families of America in addition to turning the White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me Bush Its time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no one but Republicans Lehrer Good night ReturnPath Received from roamstudentharvardedu by smtpfasharvardedu with

To cc Subject Fwd real debate Read this guysits really funny The format isnt exactly pretty but youll be able to figure it out The Real Debate Jim Lehrer Welcome to the second presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov George W Bush The candidates have agreed on these rules I will ask a question The candidate will ignore the question and deliver rehearsed remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters The opponent will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens into voting for him When a speakers time has expired I will whimper softly while he continues to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more minutes Lets start with the vice president Mr Gore can you give us the name of a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that strains the bounds of common sense Gore As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made love the way we have so often during the years of our rocksolid marriage the downtrodden have a clear choice in this election My opponent wants to cut taxes for the richest percent of Americans I on the other hand want to put the richest percent in an iron clad lock box so they cant hurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper who is here tonight Mrs Frampinhamperhas been selling her internal organs one by one to pay for gas so that she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me Also her poodle has arthritis Lehrer Gov Bush your rebuttal Bush Governors are on the front lines every day hugging people crying with them relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists I want to empower those crying people to make their own decisions unlike my opponent whose mother is not Barbara Bush Lehrer Lets turn to foreign affairs Gov Bush if Slobodan Milosevic were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia would you be able to pronounce his name Bush The current administration had eight years to deal with that guy and didnt get it done If Im elected the first thing I would do about that guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies And then Dick would present me several options for dealing with that guy And then Dick would tell me which one to choose You know as governor of Texas I have to make tough foreign policy decisions every day about how were going to deal with New Mexico Lehrer Mr Gore your rebuttal Gore Foreign policy is something Ive always been keenly interested in I served my country in Vietnam I had an uncle who was a victim of poison gas in World War I I myself lost a leg in the FrancoPrussian War And when that war was over I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a way that any undecided woman voter would find romantic If Im entrusted with the office of president I pledge to deal knowledgeably with any threat foreign or domestic by putting it in an iron clad lock box Because the American people deserve a president who can comfort them with simple metaphors Lehrer Vice President Gore how would you reform the Social Security system Gore Its a vital issue Jim Thats why Joe Lieberman and I have proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give to every senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny until the year In addition my budget commits trillion over the next years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them with the childproof cap Lehrer Gov Bush Bush Thats fuzzy math I know because as governor of Texas I have to do math every day I have to add up the numbers and decide whether Im going to fill potholes out on Rt east of Abilene or commit funds to reroof the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds Lehrer Its time for closing statements Gore Im my own man I may not be the most exciting politician but I will fight for the working families of America in addition to turning the White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me Bush Its time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no one but Republicans Lehrer Good night ReturnPath Received from roamstudentharvardedu by smtpfasharvardedu with

debate Randy my oldest son forwarded this to me and based on our political discussions at lunch the other day I thought you would enjoy it Bob Forwarded by Robert SupertyHOUECT on AM Rob Superty on PM To cc Subject Fwd real debate Read this guysits really funny The format isnt exactly pretty but youll be able to figure it out The Real Debate Jim Lehrer Welcome to the second presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov George W Bush The candidates have agreed on these rules I will ask a question The candidate will ignore the question and deliver rehearsed remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters The opponent will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens into voting for him When a speakers time has expired I will whimper softly while he continues to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more minutes Lets start with the vice president Mr Gore can you give us the name of a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that strains the bounds of common sense Gore As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made love the way we have so often during the years of our rocksolid marriage the downtrodden have a clear choice in this election My opponent wants to cut taxes for the richest percent of Americans I on the other hand want to put the richest percent in an iron clad lock box so they cant hurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper who is here tonight Mrs Frampinhamperhas been selling her internal organs one by one to pay for gas so that she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me Also her poodle has arthritis Lehrer Gov Bush your rebuttal Bush Governors are on the front lines every day hugging people crying with them relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists I want to empower those crying people to make their own decisions unlike my opponent whose mother is not Barbara Bush Lehrer Lets turn to foreign affairs Gov Bush if Slobodan Milosevic were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia would you be able to pronounce his name Bush The current administration had eight years to deal with that guy and didnt get it done If Im elected the first thing I would do about that guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies And then Dick would present me several options for dealing with that guy And then Dick would tell me which one to choose You know as governor of Texas I have to make tough foreign policy decisions every day about how were going to deal with New Mexico Lehrer Mr Gore your rebuttal Gore Foreign policy is something Ive always been keenly interested in I served my country in Vietnam I had an uncle who was a victim of poison gas in World War I I myself lost a leg in the FrancoPrussian War And when that war was over I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a way that any undecided woman voter would find romantic If Im entrusted with the office of president I pledge to deal knowledgeably with any threat foreign or domestic by putting it in an iron clad lock box Because the American people deserve a president who can comfort them with simple metaphors Lehrer Vice President Gore how would you reform the Social Security system Gore Its a vital issue Jim Thats why Joe Lieberman and I have proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give to every senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny until the year In addition my budget commits trillion over the next years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them with the childproof cap Lehrer Gov Bush Bush Thats fuzzy math I know because as governor of Texas I have to do math every day I have to add up the numbers and decide whether Im going to fill potholes out on Rt east of Abilene or commit funds to reroof the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds Lehrer Its time for closing statements Gore Im my own man I may not be the most exciting politician but I will fight for the working families of America in addition to turning the White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me Bush Its time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no one but Republicans Lehrer Good night ReturnPath Received from roamstudentharvardedu by smtpfasharvardedu with

not available Wallis noticed that the caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering wheel column Upon inserting the bullet the headlights again began to operate

struck Poole in the right testicle The vehicle swerved sharply to the right exiting the pavement and striking a tree Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident but will require surgery to repair the other wound Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and released Thank God we werent on that bridge when Thurston shot his balls off or we might both be dead stated

debate Randy my oldest son forwarded this to me and based on our political discussions at lunch the other day I thought you would enjoy it Bob Forwarded by Robert SupertyHOUECT on AM Rob Superty on PM To cc Subject Fwd real debate Read this guysits really funny The format isnt exactly pretty but youll be able to figure it out The Real Debate Jim Lehrer Welcome to the second presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov George W Bush The candidates have agreed on these rules I will ask a question The candidate will ignore the question and deliver rehearsed remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters The opponent will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens into voting for him When a speakers time has expired I will whimper softly while he continues to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more minutes Lets start with the vice president Mr Gore can you give us the name of a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that strains the bounds of common sense Gore As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made love the way we have so often during the years of our rocksolid marriage the downtrodden have a clear choice in this election My opponent wants to cut taxes for the richest percent of Americans I on the other hand want to put the richest percent in an iron clad lock box so they cant hurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper who is here tonight Mrs Frampinhamperhas been selling her internal organs one by one to pay for gas so that she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me Also her poodle has arthritis Lehrer Gov Bush your rebuttal Bush Governors are on the front lines every day hugging people crying with them relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists I want to empower those crying people to make their own decisions unlike my opponent whose mother is not Barbara Bush Lehrer Lets turn to foreign affairs Gov Bush if Slobodan Milosevic were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia would you be able to pronounce his name Bush The current administration had eight years to deal with that guy and didnt get it done If Im elected the first thing I would do about that guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies And then Dick would present me several options for dealing with that guy And then Dick would tell me which one to choose You know as governor of Texas I have to make tough foreign policy decisions every day about how were going to deal with New Mexico Lehrer Mr Gore your rebuttal Gore Foreign policy is something Ive always been keenly interested in I served my country in Vietnam I had an uncle who was a victim of poison gas in World War I I myself lost a leg in the FrancoPrussian War And when that war was over I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a way that any undecided woman voter would find romantic If Im entrusted with the office of president I pledge to deal knowledgeably with any threat foreign or domestic by putting it in an iron clad lock box Because the American people deserve a president who can comfort them with simple metaphors Lehrer Vice President Gore how would you reform the Social Security system Gore Its a vital issue Jim Thats why Joe Lieberman and I have proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give to every senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny until the year In addition my budget commits trillion over the next years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them with the childproof cap Lehrer Gov Bush Bush Thats fuzzy math I know because as governor of Texas I have to do math every day I have to add up the numbers and decide whether Im going to fill potholes out on Rt east of Abilene or commit funds to reroof the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds Lehrer Its time for closing statements Gore Im my own man I may not be the most exciting politician but I will fight for the working families of America in addition to turning the White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me Bush Its time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no one but Republicans Lehrer Good night ReturnPath Received from roamstudentharvardedu by smtpfasharvardedu with

that guy And then Dick would tell me which one to choose You know as governor of Texas I have to make tough foreign policy decisions every day about how were going to deal with New Mexico Lehrer Mr Gore your rebuttal Gore Foreign policy is something Ive always been keenly interested in I served my country in Vietnam I had an uncle who was a victim of poison gas in World War I I myself lost a leg in the FrancoPrussian War And when that war was over I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a way that any undecided woman voter would find romantic If Im entrusted with the office of president I pledge to deal knowledgeably with any threat foreign or domestic by putting it in an iron clad lock box Because the American people deserve a president who can comfort them with simple metaphors Lehrer Vice President Gore how would you reform the Social Security system Gore Its a vital issue Jim Thats why Joe Lieberman and I have proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give to every senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny until the year In addition my budget commits trillion over the next years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them with the childproof cap Lehrer Gov Bush Bush Thats fuzzy math I know because as governor of Texas I have to do math every day I have to add up the numbers and decide whether Im going to fill potholes out on Rt east of Abilene or commit funds to reroof the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds Lehrer Its time for closing statements Gore Im my own man I may not be the most exciting politician but I will fight for the working families of America in addition to turning the White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me Bush Its time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no one but Republicans Lehrer Good night
