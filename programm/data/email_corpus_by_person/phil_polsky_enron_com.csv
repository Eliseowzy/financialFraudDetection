Houstonbased energy behemoth had everything mon ey power glitz smarts new ideas and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo st important company in the world Now its stock is down wall street is be arish and the CEO is gone What went wrong by Mimi Swartz magissuesauthorsmimiswartzphp THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTONS DOWNTOWN feels like th e international headquarters of the best and the brightest The lobby in no way resembles the hushed understated entryways of the oldfashioned oil c ompanies like Shell and Texaco nearby Enron in contrast throbs with mod ernity The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black white b rown Asian Middle Eastern European African as well as Americanborn T hey are young mostly under and dressed in the aggressively casual unif orm of the tech industrythe guys wear khakis polo shirts and Banana Repu blic buttondowns Almost preposterously fit they move through the buildin g intently like winners Enron is nothing if not energetic A Big Brother size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva tors while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe ople entering from the garage A sculpture of the corporate symbol an E ti pped at a jaunty angle radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi s a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe inated Multicolored inspirational flags hang from the ceiling congratula ting Enron on its diversity and its values one more giant banner between e levator banks declares Enrons simple if grandiose goal From the Worlds Leading Energy Company to The Worlds Leading Company For a while that future seemed guaranteed as Enron transformed itself fro m a stodgy troubled pipeline company in to a trading colossus in It was a Wall Street darling with a stock price that increased per cent in that sixteenyear period with revenues that increased from bil lion to billion The very mention of the company in energy circles th roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy notes a report from Global Change Associates a firm that provides ma rket intelligence to the energy business This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling a visionary determine d to transform American business Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b y thenCEO Ken Lay Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground hauling it in pipelines and then selling it to refineries and other customers Instead it evolved into a co mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms from natural gas to electricity from wind to water If you had a risky drilling venture E nron would fund it for a piece of the action If you wanted your megacorpor ations energy needs analyzed and streamlined Enron could do the job If y ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs Enron was there to build and build Basically if an idea was new and potentiallyand fantasticallylucrative Enron wanted the first cra ck And with each success Enron became ever more certain of its destiny T he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the hightech wo rld and in February of this year Skilling reaped his reward when he succe eded Lay as chief executive officer Enron says Skilling was a great mar riage of the risktaking mentality of the oil patch with the risktaking me ntality of the financial markets The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en d of the twentieth century Like the hightech companies it emulated Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and in turn the Americ an economy Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes not just the old versus the new but t he best versus the mediocre the risk takers versus the complacentthose wh o could see the future versus those who could not The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital With the best and the brightest a company couldnt possibly go wrong Or could it Today Enrons stock trades at around down from a high of in January The press cast Enron as the archvillain of Californias ene rgy crisis last spring and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market A longtroubled power plant pro ject in India threatened the companys global ambitions Telecommunications in which Enron was heavily invested imploded Wall Street analysts who o nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices Some of the cha nge in Enrons fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer tain times that has afflicted all of American business But the culture tha t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame ENRON JEFF SKILLING SAYS HAD a totally different way of thinking about b usinesswe got it At Enron in fact you either got it or you were gone it was as simple as black and white It is not coincidental then that th e color scheme of Skillings River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed Here the living rooms white walls shimmer against the mahoga ny floors Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets Billowy sofas set off the jetblack baby grand In the entry white orchids cascade from a b lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold white mar ble There is only one offcolor note After almost twenty years Jeff Skil ling is no longer associated with Enron having resigned abruptly after jus t six months as CEO Once Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch Gene ral Electrics masterful CEO as one of Worth magazines best CEOs in Ame rica anointed in and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc hained adventure junkets in which a friend told BusinessWeek someone cou ld actually get killed Today he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr istmas morning I had no idea what Id let go of Skilling says of all th e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron From a black chair in the white library across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons Skilling clarifies The demands o f working for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances Divorc ed he lived in a squarefoot house without a microwave or a dishwash er He almost missed his brothers wedding Learning a foreign languageI never learned a foreign language he exclaims He never once took his youn gest son to school Im interested in the kids You dont do kids in fifte enminute scheduling Travel You cant go to Africa for a week and get a nything out of it Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities then he stops and sighs Im not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEOs job he says finally Then his eyes lock on mine and his voice which had softened regains it s pragmatic edge It would have been easy to stay he says But that wou ld not have been good for me Hes a smallish ruddyfaced man who keeps himself at fighting weight hand some in the way of corporate titans with piercing cheekbones and that assi duously stolid gaze But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dullwitted utility company executives is now targeted at r eporters who have labeled his resignation bizarre and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time His shrug stretches the lim its of his shimmering blue buttondown and his matching blue eyes look put upon Im surprised he says that people have so much trouble understa nding this PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni neties couldnt help but notice a funny and for its time novel scene unfo lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building From nine t o five and before and after you could see people slipping out of the prist ine silver skyscraper to smoke They perched on the chrome banisters or lur ked near the glass doors at the entry puffing like mad They always looked hurried and furtive even ashamed Whatever people knew about Enron in tho se days and most people didnt know much it was often associated with th at scene Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston and there couldnt have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past What macho engineer would have put up with s uch humiliation But this company was a child of another time that period in the mideighti es when chaos enveloped the gas business Federal deregulation of natural g as turned a steady secure industry in which gas pipeline companies freque ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served into a v olatile freeforall The situation was compounded five years later by fede ral deregulation of the pipeline business So it happened that a gentlemanl y gas pipeline company Houston Natural Gas HNG found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation Oscar Wyatts less than gentlemanly firm HNG wa s then run by Lay a sturdy taciturn former economics professor and Transc o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy His doc toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V ietnam War Lay who was from Missouri and never succumbedat least outwar dlyto Texas brashness had done well enough Thanks to canny expansions H NGs pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat e of Texas HNG fended off Coastal but to protect the company from other takeover atte mpts Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth one of the largest pipeline companies i n the country at the time Then a funny thing happened HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to comea lot like Coastal What the Nebraskans blithely labeled the purchase was being call ed the merger back in Houston and before long following some particular ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston the companys center of gr avity started shifting toward Texas and shortly after that Ken Lay was ru nning a new company called Enron Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future says one person associated with Enron at tha t time He never fought change He embraced change Lay had won but what exactly did that mean Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt and thanks to deregulation no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines Without new ideasfor that matter a whole new business planthe company could be finished before it really even got s tarted LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES Jeff Skilling ha d spent a lot of time in the Midwest and he was selfmadeat fourteen he h ad been the chief production director at a startup TV station in Aurora I llinois His mother would drop him off there every day after school I l iked being successful when I was working and I was smart he told Busines sWeek earlier this year But unlike many of his Enron colleagues Skilling wasnt deliberate and softspoken and happy to go home at five oclock he was anxious and excitable and nothing but nothing excited him more than w hat he would come to call intellectual capital He loved being smart and he loved being surrounded by smart people He graduated from Southern Meth odist University went into bankingassets and liability managementand too k on Harvard Business School where he graduated in the top percent of hi s class Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new souped up path to American success He joined Manhattans McKinsey and Company as a business consultant and that is where Ken Lay found him in It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked While everyone else was worr ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry he al one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses And so in a world w here credit was nearly impossible to come by Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers Enron would not be a broker but a banker It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved And Enron would make money on transactions much like an inv estment bank would Skilling worked up some numbers and found them absolutely compelling The n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about Enron exec utives He had a onepage presentation Almost to a person Skilling says they thought it was stupid Almost After Skilling left the meeting dej ected he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized Lay listened and th en said Lets go The Gas Bank was not an overnight success For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze ns of colleagues who had assisted him In fact he had come upon one of tho se divides that seem to define his life I believed this whole world would be different a huge breakthrough is the way Skilling puts it today and even if he is typically immodest he was right Fairly soon after launching the company sold million worth of gas in a week True to Skillings character success turned out to be a matter of old versus new He says the joke around Enron was that if a companys CEO was under fifty We were in And he was in too In Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation a new division created just fo r him In that company closed a deal that earned million in profit After that says Skilling we never looked back Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldnt work unless it ha d a trading component Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w ould make the project go But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin ate it The company had the best contacts the best intelligence and the b est access to supplies That in turn attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play With so many customers in its pocket Enron could b etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m ake trades for its own benefitEnron could in effect bet on which way the p rice of gas would go as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans but wi th startling accuracy thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m ade He created within Enron a new culture to match its new trading busin ess The idea was to build a knowledgebased business which demanded a s kill set not exactly prized by Enrons employees from the old HNG days Mos t were deliberate cautious responsible somewhat defensive people most o f them men of coursethe kind of people youd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government But now the company needed b older people for its bold new era that included anyone who wanted to make moneylots of moneyfor themselves and for the company Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die one former executive explains The peo ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out because if they had na rrow views about other things they had narrow views about the market Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people He wanted the s martest people from schools like Harvard Stanford and maybe Rice And be cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big gest and best investment banks like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B oston In addition to being smart Enron people were also supposed to be a ggressive You were right for Enron if you didnt want to wait until you w ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization You could see what he was looking for on Super Saturdays at the Houston h eadquarters eight fiftyminute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee nthe company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day They were scored from to on their smarts their problemsolving a bility their passion for hard work and what at Enron was called a sense of urgency People who scored less than were scratched The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired These were t he types that automatically turned down the companys first offer knowing Enron would come back with more The starting salary was around Ma ybe it wasnt a fortuneyetbut the signing bonus about was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof ts being renovated close to downtown Enron people didnt live in farflun g suburbs Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office For the lucky winners Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifteda ndtalented program New associates learned the latest techniques for struc turing energy deals and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g lobe The hours were long but every possible need was taken care of A com pany concierge handled all the things important people couldnt be bothered with picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions shining shoes cleaning th e house planning a vacation Of course a lot of people who worked for Enr on never got to take vacationsthey were too busy making moneybut they cou ld use the company gym and the companys personal trainers If they were ov erweight or wanted to quit smoking they could join Enrons Wellness Progra m Massages were offered six days a week from seven in the morning until t en at night They were so cutting edge rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time They really thought about th e psychology and what it took to keep these people going Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firmsanalysts associates directors and managing directorsbut everyone knew that thos e titles didnt really matter Money did Instead of competitive salaries a nd decent bonuses Enron offered competitive salaries and meritbased bonus eswith no cap If you really worked hard and delivered results you could make a lot of money says Ken Rice who stayed with Enron for years un til resigning recently as the head of the companys faltering broadband div ision Or as the saying goes you got to eat what you killed Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a million bonus And the more you produced the closer you got to Jeff Real hot dogs join ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia Land Cruiser racing in Australia or of froad motorcycling in a recreation of the Baja race ending at a sp ectacular Mexican villa Every time hed speak Id believe everything he d say one loyalist says And why not By Enron had become North Americas largest naturalgas m erchant controlling percent of the market But at a company where the b uzzword was aggressive that was no place to stop Skilling and Lay belie ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv ice at lower prices for consumers and untold profits for Enron they bega n barnstorming the country pressing their case with entrenched power compa ny presidents who with their multimilliondollar salaries and monopoly se rvice areas had little incentive to change and energy regulators who wer e somewhat more receptive thanks in part to Enrons generous lobbying effo rts But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling In Ken Lay m ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company By then the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity The divisio n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees and revenues from billion to billion Mr Skillings experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track the New York Times noted Everyone would certainly have thought so Enron and Skill ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran sforming another FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within sang the New York Times in In the staid world of regulated utilitie s and energy companies Enron Corp is that gatecrashing Elvis crowed For tune in Wall Street was demanding techsize growth on a tech timetabl e and Enron in obliged with second quarter earnings of million up percent from the previous year That year the company seemed to dis cover a market a minute Under Skilling Enron was trading coal paper ste el and even weather No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client People drank more in warm weather than cold so why not buy a hedg e against the usual winter downturn But most exciting to the financial world was Enrons entry into hightech c ommunications Because of the companys marketing dominance EnronOnline be came another overnight success handling billion in commodity trades o nline in Enron as usual made its money on the spread between the bi d price and the asking price Then there was the broadband business To Enr on trading excess capacity in large highspeed fiberoptic networks empt y lanes on the fabled information highway wasnt that different from tradi ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines So Enron created a market for wha t the industry calls bandwidth Soon after it also announced a twentyyear deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes Enron looked like a company that couldnt lose Its strat egy of building businesses shedding hard assets and trading various commo dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market BusinessWeek insis ted There was however another reason Enron did so well in such a short time the companys hardnosed approach toward its customers The old notion of c ustomer service was based on the long haulyou had to nurse and coddle cust omers to keep them But Enron had new markets and new ideascustomers had t o come to it Over time the company stopping referring to its business cli ents as customers and began calling them counterparties Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable Gains were m aximized by creating owning and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated So if you wanted to launch a highrisk ventur e quicklysuch as Zilkha Energys new hightech approach to drilling for oi lyou got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un derwrite the project if it ever would But because Enron invented its mark ets and subsequently dominated them Enron could set the terms of its deals from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene d at all While many businesses used what was known in the industry as marktomarke t accounting for instance Enron used it on an unprecedented scale The c ompany priced their deals at current market valuebut it was always Enrons idea of the market value companies that balked at their pricing didnt ge t deals And while oldfashioned companies spread their profits out like an nuities over a period of years Enron took most of its profit upfront How ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years they went on the books in the current year If a few analysts thought there mig ht be something fishy about what they called subjective accounting inves tors didnt particularly care as long as the profits rolled in As the mark et fluctuated and the landscape changed the company might abandon a projec t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins werent going to be high enough Enron is known for leaving people at the altar says one former employee Winning the highest possible profits for the comp any could even extend to Enrons attitude toward charity When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission a literacy group called on Enron for a c ontribution it was suggested that he start raising money for Enrons compe ting literacy charity Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron he says As Enron became more and more successful the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side The competition turned inward As one member of the En ron family put it It became a company full of mercenaries The change st arted at the bottom As Enrons domination of the energy market grew most of the recruiting frills fell away New associates were treated much like t he commodities the company traded Global Changes Enron spies reported ove rhearing orders like I need a smart persongo buy me one or Buy me an in telligent slave quick Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl e sang to you on your birthday but now the workaholism bordered on selfpa rody A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months It was to o disruptive People couldnt get their work done And of course Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension The Performance Review Committee which had initially been installed by S killing in the Capital group became known as the harshest forced ranking s ystem in the country Employees were rated on a scale of one to five and t hose with fives were usually gone within six months The PRCs nickname qu ickly became rank and yank It was a point of pride that Skillings divi sion replaced percent of its workforce every year As one Skilling assoc iate put it Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store Skillings approach to businessget in and get outhad become Enro ns attitude toward its workers In time it would become many workers att itude toward the company Teamwork never that valuable in a trading cultur e went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus If protocol required an Enr on higherup to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World he might helpor he might not depending on whether another potentially m ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s ight of the future says one former employee Anyone who couldnt close de als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores as were the higheru ps who had backed them Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase No old tapes became a n Enron clich People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight says one former Enron executive In such a hothouse paranoia flowered New contracts contained highly restr ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company Email was monitored A former executive routinely carried two laptops on e for the company and one for himself People may have been rich at Enron but they werent necessarily happy One recruiter described the culture thi s way They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y ou bleed to death BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the worlds leading energy company into the worlds leading company he had to make one more change J ust as he had done ten years before Skilling had to purge the company of i ts remaining old order Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea lt with tangible assets like pipelines it now valued bold executives who d ealt with intangible assets Pipelines power plantsthey may have been Enr ons pride but Skilling wanted them gone Expensive longterm building pr ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm ous returns on investment capital and Skilling knew it It wasnt the tim e for longterm approaches an Enron executive says of Wall Streets mood It was the technology era To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past Skilling had to take on Rebe cca Mark long considered his rival for the CEOs job Mark was for many ye ars the poster child for the Enron way Young attractive aggressiveher n ickname was Mark the Sharkshe came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th e requisite Harvard MBA Mark was largely responsible for the success of En ron International the assetheavy side of the company where she developed billion worth of gas and power plants which accounted for percent o f Enrons profits in For this she reaped breathtaking compensationon e Enron executive estimated millionand adoring press clips including two appearances on Fortunes list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo rate America But then Mark ran into trouble with a gasfired power plant in Dabhol Indi a one of the largest ever constructed She had played the game the Enron w ay Taking Enron into a new market she had finagled low import taxes p ercent instead of the usual and hung in through lawsuits and three c hanges in government But the time and expense needed to make India and oth er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enrons goals and Skillings impatience with Mark grew Forcing Mark out however was no easy matter Key executives left divisio ns were dismantled but she remained The truth was Enron didnt mind firin g lowerlevel employees but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive relen tless people it tended to promote The company preferred humiliationkeepin g a director in his cubicle say but failing to include him in the glamour deals or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title One particularly d ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school gratis A company a s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a publicrelations disa ster So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian They gave Mar k her own company Despite Skillings contempt for assetheavy businesses Enron spent more than billion to buy a runofthemill British water uti lity that could serve as Enrons entry into the emerging world of water pri vatization Mark was put in charge of making Enron yes the worlds greate st water company Azurix as the new business was called looked like anoth er sure thing Its IPO in raised million But Mark had to succeed on Enrons increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities Water is not li ke gas or electricityowners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up even for lots of money The company stumbled layoffs commenced an d confidence evaporated By August the stock price which had started out at had fallen to Marks resignation followed and Azurix much diminished was folded into Enron I think its best for Rebecca to start afresh Lay who had been a mentor to Mark told the Wall Street Journal Or as one critic put it They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business As drew to a close Skilling was in total command In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable The best time for the succession to occur is wh en the company is doing well he told the press Enron is doing extremely well now In February Jeff Skilling took over the CEOs job ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED Enrons domination of the electric power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac le Both PBSs Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron portraying t he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington L ay and Enrons political action committee are the top contributors to Georg e W Bush to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo od or electricity Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the companys jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif ornia as both tried to buy power online The Times reported that Lay had t ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d eregulation The bad press was to say the least ironic Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence Wall Street was discovering its we aknesses By late March the stock price had slid to a share from in January Within Enron the assetbased divisions took the rap for the decline The India plant continued to be enormously costly at least in part because of constant turnover within Enrons management team But the California situa tion was more visible and therefore more damaging despite Enrons claim th at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us says Mark Palmer a vice president for corpo rate communications We were a Texas company There was a Texan in the Whi te House California was a state that didnt put him in office and his big gest contributor was a Texas energy company Performance is going to take c are of our stock price The truth will take care of Gray Davis Californi a utilities still owe Enron million another reason stockholders might be panicky But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skillings al l too apparent lack of contrition Facing down his critics he cracked a jo ke comparing California with the Titanic At least the Titanic went down with its lights on But the biggest problem was Enrons telecommunications division which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize highspeed communications just as it had revolutionized gas and power Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiberoptic cable would grow from billi on in to billion by but then the tech bubble burst So too d id the muchhyped moviesondemand deal with Blockbuster For the first tim e in its confoundingly successful life Enron had nothing new to take to ma rket Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enrons most important cheerleaders t he stock analysts in the tent but he wasnt cut out to be a supplicant D uring the reporting of first quarter profits he called an analyst who chal lenged Enrons financial reporting an asshole When the company reported hefty second quarter profits many analysts questioned whether those profit s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse ts Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enrons accounting Skilling pr omised as he always had that innovations were just around the corner Th ere wasnt any positive news Carol Coale of Prudential Financial says n ow Basically he talked me out of a downgrade The business press so generous in the past turned surly Fortune had aske d in March whether Enron was overpriced Start with a pretty straightforw ard question How exactly does Enron make its money The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray ed in the media as a fire sale Skilling had sold million worth Ken L ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount Then the Wall Street Jour nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with in the company It was essentially risk management against Enrons possibl e failures Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th e stock price By late August it had fallen below Enron so institutio nally unforgiving finally got a taste of its own medicine When Wall Stre et is in love with a stock theyre forgiving of something like accounting says Carol Coale When a company falls out of favor all these issues ca rry more weight This fact was not lost on people inside the company who suddenly started e xperiencing an attack of conscience Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th eir ways It just created an attitude one executive still at Enron says If senior people are doing that why are we held to a higher standard Th ere was a real culture of Were above everyone else Loyalty had never been prized at Enron so there was no reason to expect it now An oldfashioned slowmoving company like Exxon could demand hardshi p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road But as one Houston oilman explains if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit h someone who doesnt have loyalty and has money then you have a corporati on thats better suited for good times than bad As it turned out that description applied to Jeff Skilling too As the sto ck price stubbornly refused to ascend he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration Then after a trip to visit the families of three employe es killed at a plant in England he had an epiphany Life was short for hi m Enron was over Ever stoic Ken Lay returned to the CEOs office named a new president arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors and promised a kinder gentler Enron in the future Trading anything and everything was out The company Lay says will still innovate but innovat e much closer to our core As for the culture Things like the Performanc e Review Committee I think we could have applied better By trying to cate gorize people into so many different categories you ended up creating a mo rale problem That Skillings supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence Despite Skillings lengthy tenure wi th Enron hed always been contemptuous of the long haul hed always belie ved in cutting losses and moving on But now that he was abandoning them wh en the company was in trouble it was different Even Jeffs biggest detra ctors wouldnt have wanted him to walk out the door one loyalist admits But on the day we meet Skilling is looking forward not back Look he s ays with finality ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron Were my int erests aligned with the shareholders Absolutely Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures he is nestling hims elf back into the world of ideas His eyes flash as he talks about new tech nologies The first wave never gets it right he says The standalone d otcoms didnt work but the technological applications will create a secon d wave that will change the world Houston he promises will become the w orlds center of commodity trading and he intends to be a part of it In f act he is already shopping for office space This is the second wave and Enrons got it he says almost breathless There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g et it

C ENDS Nov RSFEnron sounds debt alarm reduces reported earnings By C Bryson Hull HOUSTON Nov Reuters Humbled energy giant Enron Corp ENEN on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a million debt by next week and reduced its alreadyabysmal thirdquarter earnings The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with US Securities and Exchange Commission Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week That marked the start of a nineday period that expires on Nov during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships If not the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise million in cash The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements since it can illafford to pay the debt now Enron has already already maxed out its billion credit line secured roughly billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat Enron also reduced previously reported thirdquarter earnings by cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first months of the year by a penny per share The move reflects adjustments made after the quarters end Enron said On Oct Enron reported a loss of million or cents per share for the third quarter of On Nov Enron said it had restated earnings for and that net income for the fouryear period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay billion to other partnerships the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and would likely have a material adverse impact on Enrons ability to

collapses in recent memory leaving Enron to be bought on Nov by smaller crosstown rival Dynegy Inc DYNN for the firesale price of billion in stock In an unusual note Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant per SEC regulations because of the need of Arthur Andersen LLP Enrons independent auditors to complete their review procedures

Phil Wood Brian Durst Philip Gualy Jaime Corbacho Seb astian Wolfe Tony SubjectFW Dynegy vs Enron A Tale of Two Companies Interesting reading boys following up on our conversations last night M October Dynegy vs Enron A Tale of Two Companies By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Facts Dynegy Inc NYSE DYN beat expectations in the third quarter repo rting that its earnings rose to million or cents per diluted share from million or cents per diluted share for the same period in This represented a percent increase from Q and boosted the c ompanys earnings estimate Dynegy has a market capitalization of billion Its stock is currently trading at about down from a week high of although it is important to note that for yearend the co mpanys stock was one of the top performers among Standard Poors com panies with a total shareholder return of percent Dynegy employs people Enron Corp NYSE ENE reported million in losses for the third quart er after taking billion in charges associated with several of its no ncore businesses The companys Q recurring net income before the write offs increased percent to million or cents a diluted share an d revenue in the quarter rose to billion from billion in Q Enron has a market capitalization of billion Its stock is currently trading at about which represents a sixyear low for the company an d is considerably lower than the peak of hit in August Enron empl oys people Analysis Dynegy closed out a banner year in and appears to still be o n a roll in terms of its financial performance In contrast Enron faced an unprecedented year of turmoil and is presently languishing in a low ebb characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the comp anys financial reporting While the two companies operate in the same mark et space of power trading and are fierce competitors Dynegyironically the younger and smaller of the two companiesis an industry success story whil e Enrons status remains rather uncertain The questions to be addressed in this article are What is Dynegy doing right What is Enron doing wrong What lessons can other power and naturalgas marketers learn from this tale of two companies Although they are often referred to as crosstown rivals Dynegy and Enro n are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions Their divergent approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the singlem ost important element related to their disparate positions at the end of Put more simply the two companies have vastly different strategies an dhindsight being a strong argument can be made that Dynegys strateg y is the winner at this juncture Throughout this article I will focus on two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically Those two key areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to whi ch the companies have expanded and invested into noncore sectors Both companies started out as naturalgas companies and converged into the power market in the s However that is essentially where their similar ities end and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decid edly different paths In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary let me summarize the two paths this way Enron does not believe it needs t o own physical assets to be a success in the power and naturalgas trading sector Dynegy on the other hand not only believes in the ownership of ph ysical assets but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the compa ny as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry Lets look at the companies separately Well discuss Enron first since it is the older of the two Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficul t to define but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates comm odity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers The participation and success in commodity markets according to Enron does n ot necessitate ownership of physical assets In fact the company has routi nely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wh olesale business Rather Enron has concentrated on developing a new philos ophy of risk management excellence in which it will merely buy and sell th e commodities it needs to participate in trading venues As an example Enron bought Portland General which owns MW of genera tion and kilometers of electric Tlines in as a way to launch its penetration of the West Coast power markets When competition fizzled i n that region Enron put Portland General back on the sales block a sale o f Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing Likewi se in Europe where it is one of the most prominent trading companies Enro n has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and u nlike other US competitors has refrained from buying additional generati ng units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy According to its m ost recent K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission En ron owns or controls MW of generating capacity including joint owner ships which is drastically lower than the average among other companies o perating in the power trading sector Dynegys approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different fr om Enrons In the words of CEO Chuck Watson Dynegys longterm strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets which supports earnings sustainability Ever since going public in Dynegy has been on an acquisition binge with each purchase significantly increasing its g eneration capability Dynegy presently owns or controls about MW of generating capacity in the United States gasprocessing plants and miles of pipelines which are located in geographically competitive area s The companys goal is to own or control MW or percent of the US market within the next five years Sometimes Dynegy has acquired ass ets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy but just as often it has purchased assets independently Most notably when Dynegy a cquired Illinova in early the purchase doubled Dynegys generating ca pacity Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe wher e it is presently planning to purchase naturalgas storage facilities in En gland Dynegy executives have argued that naturalgas storage is the best w ay to back up a naturalgas trading operation Theres no question that the approach is working Out of the million that Dynegy reported in the t hird quarter million of it came from the companys main wholesale bus iness The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference be tween Enron and Dynegy and its significance should not be overlooked It i s not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegys approach Owning phys ical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the cour se of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price In other words by controlling the actu al output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells a trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region how much power can be produced to meet that load a nd when shortages might occur In addition in markets that are short on in frastructure it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region By t he same token those companies that do control physical assets often have g reater communication with grid operators and possible insight to spreads the difference between various energy prices In fact Dynegys CEO Watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around t he volatility of price and being capable of resolving balances when shorta ges exist This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomp lish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids Dynegys strategy of acquiring both naturalgas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities On the other side of this argument a case could be made that Enrons appro ach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility Certainly by investing less in power generation facilities Enron has less capital o n the line when compared to a company like Dynegy Under a scenario when ma rket prices suddenly drop a company such as Enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an as setladen company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixe d payments of a generation facility Assetheavy companies also may find th at their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilit ies in times of extreme price volatility As the industry becomes increasin gly focused on bottomline results this could be seen as a potential conce rn for investors Further some would argue that Enrons approach of establ ishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell r equirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility What E nron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own po rtfolio Consequently the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the g reat debate among power traders However although Dynegys overall perfor mance in the third quarter was better than Enrons that does not necessari ly provide a clear endorsement of Dynegys strategy toward acquiring new ge neration facilities Keep in mind that Enrons Q losses resulted primarily from nonrecurring charges related to its noncore businesses broadband a nd water in particular Without these charges Enrons core wholesale trad ing business continues to perform well This is a point that CEO Ken Lay ha s been quick to reiterate to investors Our percent increase in recurri ng earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core who lesale and retail energy businesses and our naturalgas pipelines Lay sai d The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enrons leadi ng market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook Moreover perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets the key issu e that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earn ings in the third quarter is the companies approach to developing new line s of business Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point Enron which prides itself as usually gaining a firststrike advantage plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies Under the lea dership of thenCEO Jeffrey Skilling Enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would qui ckly become lucrative Now Lay admits that the company could have gotten i nto the broadband business with less capital and that Enron spent too muc h too soon in this sector Nevertheless Enron recorded an million non recurring writedown for restructuring its broadband unit in the third qua rter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by red ucing future costs in this sector to million a quarter Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared t o Enron Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom s ector but in the third quarter took a million loss in its broadband bu siness compared to the million loss that Enron reported However Dyneg y clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities electricity and natural gas and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical wa y that merely supplements its core business It is also important to note that Enron gained the firststrike advantage w hen it developed EnronOnline an electronic trading exchange In fact Enro n was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space well ahead of its competitors Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydi rect The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was s uccessful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline ha s recorded transactions that exceed in notional value Since its incep tion in November Dynegydirect has recorded billion in notional tr ansactions At this juncture Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting Enron which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enrons CFO To my rec ollection no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet and thus the companys status with investors is arguably more solid As I dont expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon my projection is that at least in the near term we will cont inue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and Enron That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game A s noted the companys core business of wholesale business remains strong but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other noncore businesses Th at doesnt mean Enron is down permanently but it will have to find a way t o strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and thos e businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous In many ways the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the to rtoise and the hare parable I am sure you can guess which company is the t ortoise and which is the hare in this analogy The race between the two is far from over although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point based on i ts more methodical approach What will be fascinating to observe is how bot h companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly mo dify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies

Houstonbased energy behemoth had everything mon ey power glitz smarts new ideas and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo st important company in the world Now its stock is down wall street is be arish and the CEO is gone What went wrong by Mimi Swartz magissuesauthorsmimiswartzphp THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTONS DOWNTOWN feels like th e international headquarters of the best and the brightest The lobby in no way resembles the hushed understated entryways of the oldfashioned oil c ompanies like Shell and Texaco nearby Enron in contrast throbs with mod ernity The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black white b rown Asian Middle Eastern European African as well as Americanborn T hey are young mostly under and dressed in the aggressively casual unif orm of the tech industrythe guys wear khakis polo shirts and Banana Repu blic buttondowns Almost preposterously fit they move through the buildin g intently like winners Enron is nothing if not energetic A Big Brother size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva tors while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe ople entering from the garage A sculpture of the corporate symbol an E ti pped at a jaunty angle radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi s a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe inated Multicolored inspirational flags hang from the ceiling congratula ting Enron on its diversity and its values one more giant banner between e levator banks declares Enrons simple if grandiose goal From the Worlds Leading Energy Company to The Worlds Leading Company For a while that future seemed guaranteed as Enron transformed itself fro m a stodgy troubled pipeline company in to a trading colossus in It was a Wall Street darling with a stock price that increased per cent in that sixteenyear period with revenues that increased from bil lion to billion The very mention of the company in energy circles th roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy notes a report from Global Change Associates a firm that provides ma rket intelligence to the energy business This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling a visionary determine d to transform American business Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b y thenCEO Ken Lay Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground hauling it in pipelines and then selling it to refineries and other customers Instead it evolved into a co mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms from natural gas to electricity from wind to water If you had a risky drilling venture E nron would fund it for a piece of the action If you wanted your megacorpor ations energy needs analyzed and streamlined Enron could do the job If y ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs Enron was there to build and build Basically if an idea was new and potentiallyand fantasticallylucrative Enron wanted the first cra ck And with each success Enron became ever more certain of its destiny T he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the hightech wo rld and in February of this year Skilling reaped his reward when he succe eded Lay as chief executive officer Enron says Skilling was a great mar riage of the risktaking mentality of the oil patch with the risktaking me ntality of the financial markets The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en d of the twentieth century Like the hightech companies it emulated Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and in turn the Americ an economy Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes not just the old versus the new but t he best versus the mediocre the risk takers versus the complacentthose wh o could see the future versus those who could not The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital With the best and the brightest a company couldnt possibly go wrong Or could it Today Enrons stock trades at around down from a high of in January The press cast Enron as the archvillain of Californias ene rgy crisis last spring and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market A longtroubled power plant pro ject in India threatened the companys global ambitions Telecommunications in which Enron was heavily invested imploded Wall Street analysts who o nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices Some of the cha nge in Enrons fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer tain times that has afflicted all of American business But the culture tha t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame ENRON JEFF SKILLING SAYS HAD a totally different way of thinking about b usinesswe got it At Enron in fact you either got it or you were gone it was as simple as black and white It is not coincidental then that th e color scheme of Skillings River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed Here the living rooms white walls shimmer against the mahoga ny floors Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets Billowy sofas set off the jetblack baby grand In the entry white orchids cascade from a b lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold white mar ble There is only one offcolor note After almost twenty years Jeff Skil ling is no longer associated with Enron having resigned abruptly after jus t six months as CEO Once Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch Gene ral Electrics masterful CEO as one of Worth magazines best CEOs in Ame rica anointed in and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc hained adventure junkets in which a friend told BusinessWeek someone cou ld actually get killed Today he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr istmas morning I had no idea what Id let go of Skilling says of all th e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron From a black chair in the white library across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons Skilling clarifies The demands o f working for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances Divorc ed he lived in a squarefoot house without a microwave or a dishwash er He almost missed his brothers wedding Learning a foreign languageI never learned a foreign language he exclaims He never once took his youn gest son to school Im interested in the kids You dont do kids in fifte enminute scheduling Travel You cant go to Africa for a week and get a nything out of it Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities then he stops and sighs Im not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEOs job he says finally Then his eyes lock on mine and his voice which had softened regains it s pragmatic edge It would have been easy to stay he says But that wou ld not have been good for me Hes a smallish ruddyfaced man who keeps himself at fighting weight hand some in the way of corporate titans with piercing cheekbones and that assi duously stolid gaze But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dullwitted utility company executives is now targeted at r eporters who have labeled his resignation bizarre and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time His shrug stretches the lim its of his shimmering blue buttondown and his matching blue eyes look put upon Im surprised he says that people have so much trouble understa nding this PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni neties couldnt help but notice a funny and for its time novel scene unfo lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building From nine t o five and before and after you could see people slipping out of the prist ine silver skyscraper to smoke They perched on the chrome banisters or lur ked near the glass doors at the entry puffing like mad They always looked hurried and furtive even ashamed Whatever people knew about Enron in tho se days and most people didnt know much it was often associated with th at scene Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston and there couldnt have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past What macho engineer would have put up with s uch humiliation But this company was a child of another time that period in the mideighti es when chaos enveloped the gas business Federal deregulation of natural g as turned a steady secure industry in which gas pipeline companies freque ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served into a v olatile freeforall The situation was compounded five years later by fede ral deregulation of the pipeline business So it happened that a gentlemanl y gas pipeline company Houston Natural Gas HNG found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation Oscar Wyatts less than gentlemanly firm HNG wa s then run by Lay a sturdy taciturn former economics professor and Transc o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy His doc toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V ietnam War Lay who was from Missouri and never succumbedat least outwar dlyto Texas brashness had done well enough Thanks to canny expansions H NGs pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat e of Texas HNG fended off Coastal but to protect the company from other takeover atte mpts Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth one of the largest pipeline companies i n the country at the time Then a funny thing happened HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to comea lot like Coastal What the Nebraskans blithely labeled the purchase was being call ed the merger back in Houston and before long following some particular ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston the companys center of gr avity started shifting toward Texas and shortly after that Ken Lay was ru nning a new company called Enron Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future says one person associated with Enron at tha t time He never fought change He embraced change Lay had won but what exactly did that mean Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt and thanks to deregulation no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines Without new ideasfor that matter a whole new business planthe company could be finished before it really even got s tarted LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES Jeff Skilling ha d spent a lot of time in the Midwest and he was selfmadeat fourteen he h ad been the chief production director at a startup TV station in Aurora I llinois His mother would drop him off there every day after school I l iked being successful when I was working and I was smart he told Busines sWeek earlier this year But unlike many of his Enron colleagues Skilling wasnt deliberate and softspoken and happy to go home at five oclock he was anxious and excitable and nothing but nothing excited him more than w hat he would come to call intellectual capital He loved being smart and he loved being surrounded by smart people He graduated from Southern Meth odist University went into bankingassets and liability managementand too k on Harvard Business School where he graduated in the top percent of hi s class Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new souped up path to American success He joined Manhattans McKinsey and Company as a business consultant and that is where Ken Lay found him in It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked While everyone else was worr ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry he al one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses And so in a world w here credit was nearly impossible to come by Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers Enron would not be a broker but a banker It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved And Enron would make money on transactions much like an inv estment bank would Skilling worked up some numbers and found them absolutely compelling The n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about Enron exec utives He had a onepage presentation Almost to a person Skilling says they thought it was stupid Almost After Skilling left the meeting dej ected he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized Lay listened and th en said Lets go The Gas Bank was not an overnight success For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze ns of colleagues who had assisted him In fact he had come upon one of tho se divides that seem to define his life I believed this whole world would be different a huge breakthrough is the way Skilling puts it today and even if he is typically immodest he was right Fairly soon after launching the company sold million worth of gas in a week True to Skillings character success turned out to be a matter of old versus new He says the joke around Enron was that if a companys CEO was under fifty We were in And he was in too In Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation a new division created just fo r him In that company closed a deal that earned million in profit After that says Skilling we never looked back Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldnt work unless it ha d a trading component Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w ould make the project go But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin ate it The company had the best contacts the best intelligence and the b est access to supplies That in turn attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play With so many customers in its pocket Enron could b etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m ake trades for its own benefitEnron could in effect bet on which way the p rice of gas would go as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans but wi th startling accuracy thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m ade He created within Enron a new culture to match its new trading busin ess The idea was to build a knowledgebased business which demanded a s kill set not exactly prized by Enrons employees from the old HNG days Mos t were deliberate cautious responsible somewhat defensive people most o f them men of coursethe kind of people youd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government But now the company needed b older people for its bold new era that included anyone who wanted to make moneylots of moneyfor themselves and for the company Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die one former executive explains The peo ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out because if they had na rrow views about other things they had narrow views about the market Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people He wanted the s martest people from schools like Harvard Stanford and maybe Rice And be cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big gest and best investment banks like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B oston In addition to being smart Enron people were also supposed to be a ggressive You were right for Enron if you didnt want to wait until you w ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization You could see what he was looking for on Super Saturdays at the Houston h eadquarters eight fiftyminute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee nthe company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day They were scored from to on their smarts their problemsolving a bility their passion for hard work and what at Enron was called a sense of urgency People who scored less than were scratched The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired These were t he types that automatically turned down the companys first offer knowing Enron would come back with more The starting salary was around Ma ybe it wasnt a fortuneyetbut the signing bonus about was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof ts being renovated close to downtown Enron people didnt live in farflun g suburbs Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office For the lucky winners Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifteda ndtalented program New associates learned the latest techniques for struc turing energy deals and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g lobe The hours were long but every possible need was taken care of A com pany concierge handled all the things important people couldnt be bothered with picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions shining shoes cleaning th e house planning a vacation Of course a lot of people who worked for Enr on never got to take vacationsthey were too busy making moneybut they cou ld use the company gym and the companys personal trainers If they were ov erweight or wanted to quit smoking they could join Enrons Wellness Progra m Massages were offered six days a week from seven in the morning until t en at night They were so cutting edge rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time They really thought about th e psychology and what it took to keep these people going Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firmsanalysts associates directors and managing directorsbut everyone knew that thos e titles didnt really matter Money did Instead of competitive salaries a nd decent bonuses Enron offered competitive salaries and meritbased bonus eswith no cap If you really worked hard and delivered results you could make a lot of money says Ken Rice who stayed with Enron for years un til resigning recently as the head of the companys faltering broadband div ision Or as the saying goes you got to eat what you killed Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a million bonus And the more you produced the closer you got to Jeff Real hot dogs join ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia Land Cruiser racing in Australia or of froad motorcycling in a recreation of the Baja race ending at a sp ectacular Mexican villa Every time hed speak Id believe everything he d say one loyalist says And why not By Enron had become North Americas largest naturalgas m erchant controlling percent of the market But at a company where the b uzzword was aggressive that was no place to stop Skilling and Lay belie ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv ice at lower prices for consumers and untold profits for Enron they bega n barnstorming the country pressing their case with entrenched power compa ny presidents who with their multimilliondollar salaries and monopoly se rvice areas had little incentive to change and energy regulators who wer e somewhat more receptive thanks in part to Enrons generous lobbying effo rts But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling In Ken Lay m ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company By then the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity The divisio n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees and revenues from billion to billion Mr Skillings experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track the New York Times noted Everyone would certainly have thought so Enron and Skill ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran sforming another FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within sang the New York Times in In the staid world of regulated utilitie s and energy companies Enron Corp is that gatecrashing Elvis crowed For tune in Wall Street was demanding techsize growth on a tech timetabl e and Enron in obliged with second quarter earnings of million up percent from the previous year That year the company seemed to dis cover a market a minute Under Skilling Enron was trading coal paper ste el and even weather No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client People drank more in warm weather than cold so why not buy a hedg e against the usual winter downturn But most exciting to the financial world was Enrons entry into hightech c ommunications Because of the companys marketing dominance EnronOnline be came another overnight success handling billion in commodity trades o nline in Enron as usual made its money on the spread between the bi d price and the asking price Then there was the broadband business To Enr on trading excess capacity in large highspeed fiberoptic networks empt y lanes on the fabled information highway wasnt that different from tradi ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines So Enron created a market for wha t the industry calls bandwidth Soon after it also announced a twentyyear deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes Enron looked like a company that couldnt lose Its strat egy of building businesses shedding hard assets and trading various commo dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market BusinessWeek insis ted There was however another reason Enron did so well in such a short time the companys hardnosed approach toward its customers The old notion of c ustomer service was based on the long haulyou had to nurse and coddle cust omers to keep them But Enron had new markets and new ideascustomers had t o come to it Over time the company stopping referring to its business cli ents as customers and began calling them counterparties Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable Gains were m aximized by creating owning and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated So if you wanted to launch a highrisk ventur e quicklysuch as Zilkha Energys new hightech approach to drilling for oi lyou got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un derwrite the project if it ever would But because Enron invented its mark ets and subsequently dominated them Enron could set the terms of its deals from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene d at all While many businesses used what was known in the industry as marktomarke t accounting for instance Enron used it on an unprecedented scale The c ompany priced their deals at current market valuebut it was always Enrons idea of the market value companies that balked at their pricing didnt ge t deals And while oldfashioned companies spread their profits out like an nuities over a period of years Enron took most of its profit upfront How ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years they went on the books in the current year If a few analysts thought there mig ht be something fishy about what they called subjective accounting inves tors didnt particularly care as long as the profits rolled in As the mark et fluctuated and the landscape changed the company might abandon a projec t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins werent going to be high enough Enron is known for leaving people at the altar says one former employee Winning the highest possible profits for the comp any could even extend to Enrons attitude toward charity When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission a literacy group called on Enron for a c ontribution it was suggested that he start raising money for Enrons compe ting literacy charity Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron he says As Enron became more and more successful the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side The competition turned inward As one member of the En ron family put it It became a company full of mercenaries The change st arted at the bottom As Enrons domination of the energy market grew most of the recruiting frills fell away New associates were treated much like t he commodities the company traded Global Changes Enron spies reported ove rhearing orders like I need a smart persongo buy me one or Buy me an in telligent slave quick Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl e sang to you on your birthday but now the workaholism bordered on selfpa rody A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months It was to o disruptive People couldnt get their work done And of course Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension The Performance Review Committee which had initially been installed by S killing in the Capital group became known as the harshest forced ranking s ystem in the country Employees were rated on a scale of one to five and t hose with fives were usually gone within six months The PRCs nickname qu ickly became rank and yank It was a point of pride that Skillings divi sion replaced percent of its workforce every year As one Skilling assoc iate put it Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store Skillings approach to businessget in and get outhad become Enro ns attitude toward its workers In time it would become many workers att itude toward the company Teamwork never that valuable in a trading cultur e went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus If protocol required an Enr on higherup to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World he might helpor he might not depending on whether another potentially m ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s ight of the future says one former employee Anyone who couldnt close de als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores as were the higheru ps who had backed them Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase No old tapes became a n Enron clich People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight says one former Enron executive In such a hothouse paranoia flowered New contracts contained highly restr ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company Email was monitored A former executive routinely carried two laptops on e for the company and one for himself People may have been rich at Enron but they werent necessarily happy One recruiter described the culture thi s way They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y ou bleed to death BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the worlds leading energy company into the worlds leading company he had to make one more change J ust as he had done ten years before Skilling had to purge the company of i ts remaining old order Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea lt with tangible assets like pipelines it now valued bold executives who d ealt with intangible assets Pipelines power plantsthey may have been Enr ons pride but Skilling wanted them gone Expensive longterm building pr ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm ous returns on investment capital and Skilling knew it It wasnt the tim e for longterm approaches an Enron executive says of Wall Streets mood It was the technology era To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past Skilling had to take on Rebe cca Mark long considered his rival for the CEOs job Mark was for many ye ars the poster child for the Enron way Young attractive aggressiveher n ickname was Mark the Sharkshe came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th e requisite Harvard MBA Mark was largely responsible for the success of En ron International the assetheavy side of the company where she developed billion worth of gas and power plants which accounted for percent o f Enrons profits in For this she reaped breathtaking compensationon e Enron executive estimated millionand adoring press clips including two appearances on Fortunes list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo rate America But then Mark ran into trouble with a gasfired power plant in Dabhol Indi a one of the largest ever constructed She had played the game the Enron w ay Taking Enron into a new market she had finagled low import taxes p ercent instead of the usual and hung in through lawsuits and three c hanges in government But the time and expense needed to make India and oth er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enrons goals and Skillings impatience with Mark grew Forcing Mark out however was no easy matter Key executives left divisio ns were dismantled but she remained The truth was Enron didnt mind firin g lowerlevel employees but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive relen tless people it tended to promote The company preferred humiliationkeepin g a director in his cubicle say but failing to include him in the glamour deals or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title One particularly d ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school gratis A company a s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a publicrelations disa ster So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian They gave Mar k her own company Despite Skillings contempt for assetheavy businesses Enron spent more than billion to buy a runofthemill British water uti lity that could serve as Enrons entry into the emerging world of water pri vatization Mark was put in charge of making Enron yes the worlds greate st water company Azurix as the new business was called looked like anoth er sure thing Its IPO in raised million But Mark had to succeed on Enrons increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities Water is not li ke gas or electricityowners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up even for lots of money The company stumbled layoffs commenced an d confidence evaporated By August the stock price which had started out at had fallen to Marks resignation followed and Azurix much diminished was folded into Enron I think its best for Rebecca to start afresh Lay who had been a mentor to Mark told the Wall Street Journal Or as one critic put it They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business As drew to a close Skilling was in total command In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable The best time for the succession to occur is wh en the company is doing well he told the press Enron is doing extremely well now In February Jeff Skilling took over the CEOs job ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED Enrons domination of the electric power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac le Both PBSs Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron portraying t he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington L ay and Enrons political action committee are the top contributors to Georg e W Bush to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo od or electricity Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the companys jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif ornia as both tried to buy power online The Times reported that Lay had t ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d eregulation The bad press was to say the least ironic Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence Wall Street was discovering its we aknesses By late March the stock price had slid to a share from in January Within Enron the assetbased divisions took the rap for the decline The India plant continued to be enormously costly at least in part because of constant turnover within Enrons management team But the California situa tion was more visible and therefore more damaging despite Enrons claim th at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us says Mark Palmer a vice president for corpo rate communications We were a Texas company There was a Texan in the Whi te House California was a state that didnt put him in office and his big gest contributor was a Texas energy company Performance is going to take c are of our stock price The truth will take care of Gray Davis Californi a utilities still owe Enron million another reason stockholders might be panicky But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skillings al l too apparent lack of contrition Facing down his critics he cracked a jo ke comparing California with the Titanic At least the Titanic went down with its lights on But the biggest problem was Enrons telecommunications division which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize highspeed communications just as it had revolutionized gas and power Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiberoptic cable would grow from billi on in to billion by but then the tech bubble burst So too d id the muchhyped moviesondemand deal with Blockbuster For the first tim e in its confoundingly successful life Enron had nothing new to take to ma rket Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enrons most important cheerleaders t he stock analysts in the tent but he wasnt cut out to be a supplicant D uring the reporting of first quarter profits he called an analyst who chal lenged Enrons financial reporting an asshole When the company reported hefty second quarter profits many analysts questioned whether those profit s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse ts Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enrons accounting Skilling pr omised as he always had that innovations were just around the corner Th ere wasnt any positive news Carol Coale of Prudential Financial says n ow Basically he talked me out of a downgrade The business press so generous in the past turned surly Fortune had aske d in March whether Enron was overpriced Start with a pretty straightforw ard question How exactly does Enron make its money The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray ed in the media as a fire sale Skilling had sold million worth Ken L ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount Then the Wall Street Jour nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with in the company It was essentially risk management against Enrons possibl e failures Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th e stock price By late August it had fallen below Enron so institutio nally unforgiving finally got a taste of its own medicine When Wall Stre et is in love with a stock theyre forgiving of something like accounting says Carol Coale When a company falls out of favor all these issues ca rry more weight This fact was not lost on people inside the company who suddenly started e xperiencing an attack of conscience Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th eir ways It just created an attitude one executive still at Enron says If senior people are doing that why are we held to a higher standard Th ere was a real culture of Were above everyone else Loyalty had never been prized at Enron so there was no reason to expect it now An oldfashioned slowmoving company like Exxon could demand hardshi p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road But as one Houston oilman explains if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit h someone who doesnt have loyalty and has money then you have a corporati on thats better suited for good times than bad As it turned out that description applied to Jeff Skilling too As the sto ck price stubbornly refused to ascend he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration Then after a trip to visit the families of three employe es killed at a plant in England he had an epiphany Life was short for hi m Enron was over Ever stoic Ken Lay returned to the CEOs office named a new president arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors and promised a kinder gentler Enron in the future Trading anything and everything was out The company Lay says will still innovate but innovat e much closer to our core As for the culture Things like the Performanc e Review Committee I think we could have applied better By trying to cate gorize people into so many different categories you ended up creating a mo rale problem That Skillings supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence Despite Skillings lengthy tenure wi th Enron hed always been contemptuous of the long haul hed always belie ved in cutting losses and moving on But now that he was abandoning them wh en the company was in trouble it was different Even Jeffs biggest detra ctors wouldnt have wanted him to walk out the door one loyalist admits But on the day we meet Skilling is looking forward not back Look he s ays with finality ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron Were my int erests aligned with the shareholders Absolutely Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures he is nestling hims elf back into the world of ideas His eyes flash as he talks about new tech nologies The first wave never gets it right he says The standalone d otcoms didnt work but the technological applications will create a secon d wave that will change the world Houston he promises will become the w orlds center of commodity trading and he intends to be a part of it In f act he is already shopping for office space This is the second wave and Enrons got it he says almost breathless There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g et it

energy giant Enron Corp ENEN on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a million debt by next week and reduced its alreadyabysmal thirdquarter earnings The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with US Securities and Exchange Commission Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week That marked the start of a nineday period that expires on Nov during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships If not the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise million in cash The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements since it can illafford to pay the debt now Enron has already already maxed out its billion credit line secured roughly billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat Enron also reduced previously reported thirdquarter earnings by cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first months of the year by a penny per share The move reflects adjustments made after the quarters end Enron said On Oct Enron reported a loss of million or cents per share for the third quarter of On Nov Enron said it had restated earnings for and that net income for the fouryear period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay billion to other partnerships the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and would likely have a material adverse impact on Enrons ability to continue as a going concern the company wrote Enron had released those figures earlier but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability CREDIT COULD BE A KILLER Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to Baa and BBBminus just one notch above junk status Each warned it may cut its respective ratings again Moodys also cut Enrons shortterm debt rating which affects commercial paper to Not Prime a junk rating In nearly all of its partnership deals Enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels At the close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange Enron shares were at well below the trigger prices All of the partnerships which Enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet have become the onceproud companys bane The SEC is investigating potential conflictofinterest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow served as general partner Enron had to extract itself from those partnerships which led to a billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity The revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory leaving Enron to be bought on Nov by smaller crosstown rival Dynegy Inc DYNN for the firesale price of billion in stock In an unusual note Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant per SEC regulations because of the need of Arthur Andersen LLP Enrons independent auditors to complete their review procedures Arthur Andersen had no comment but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enrons board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audits completion Additional reporting by Andrew Kelly in Houston and Jonathan Stempel in New York Houston bureau For Related News Double Click on one of
