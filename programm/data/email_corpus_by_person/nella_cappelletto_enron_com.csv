COMMUNICATION Please see the attached memo from Rob Hemstock to Steve Kean and Rick Shapiro for your information The most noteable items are a the Power Pool Participant Behaviour Guidelines published in March and b the history of changes to the Power Pool of Alberta Regards Peter Keohane Forwarded by Nella CappellettoCALECT on AM From Robert Hemstock PM To Steven J ES Richard ES cc Peter CT Aleck CT Subject Project Stanley History of the Design of the Alberta Power Pool Model I understand your call to me yesterday was to inquire about the vision the architects of the Power Pool of Alberta had when they were setting up the Power Pool and more particularly whether they envisioned that unsophisticated Pool Participant would be expected to obtain assistance from other more sophisticated Pool Participants to maximize the price that it would receive from the Power Pool for the energy it sold into the Power Pool I have reviewed the some materials ie AEUB Decisions Alberta Department of Energy documents and have found nothing related to this This is not surprising as these market design issues were considered in Alberta in and long before I arrived on the electricity scene in I did speak to a consultant who was involved in the market design process in the early s named Jim Fitzowich Jim joined TransAlta in and then worked for TransCanada Power until January when he established his current consulting practice Jim became a member of the Power Pool Council in late and stayed in that position until May when an independent Power Pool Council was appointed Jim and I are both on the Board of Directors of the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta and I know Jim fairly well Jim advised that the Alberta electricity industry design was quarterbacked by the Deputy Minister of Energy of the day named Rick Hyndman Under Rick Hyndmans direction a White Paper was apparently released in October in which a power exchange regime modelled on the exchange regime in the UK was thoroughly discussed and proposed for Alberta According to Jim Fitzowich this White Paper was the initial blueprint for the Alberta market design I have met Rick Hyndman a few times and understand he left government a few years ago and is also a consultant I left Rick a message to call me and I intend to ask him to send me a copy of the White Paper and also inquire about the nature of his consulting work On a related note attached is an email I sent to Bill G and John L in March advising them of the new Power Pool Participant Behavior Guidelines that were added to the Power Pool Rules in March You can see the original notice of the rule change received from the Power Pool is also attached as are the actual Participant Behavior Guidelines see Change a While I appreciate the determination of whether an offence occurred under the Competition Act would be independent of the compliance or not with the Power Pool Rules I think it is noteworthy that the Power Pool incorporated these entirely new set of Participant Behavior Guidelines only recently and after the acts that are the subject of Project Stanley had occurred You should also be aware that there is a document on the Power Pool website indexlinkshtml entitled Summary of Power Pool Rule Changes that appears to list all the rule changes that have occurred since the Power Pool began operation in Regards Rob Forwarded by Robert HemstockCALECT on PM From Robert Hemstock PM To Bill CT John J CT cc Aleck CT Peter CT Subject Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes Attached are a number of Pool Rule Changes that I expect will be approved today by the Power Pool Council The most noteworthy change is the addition of the new Rule Participant Behavior Guidelines The Participant Behavior Guidelines contain very broad language but are intended to provide market participants with guidance from the Pool on the types of activities that it considers to constitute anticompetitive behavior It identifies three categories of undesireable practices namely a sharing of competitive information b abuse of dominant position which includes physical or economic witholding of facilities or energy so as to adversely impact upon the efficient fair and openly competitive operation of the market and c other practices including conduct that would cause a material change in price In my view this new Rule does not extend any additional powers to the Power Pool or the Market Survelliance Administrator beyond the already broad authority given to the MSA in Section of the Electric Utilities Act It is my sense from conversations I had with stakeholders at the IPPSA Conference that the Power Pools motivation behind this new Rule was to send a message to Powerex and the PPA Owners that the Power Pool is concerned about their market power and iswill be monitoring them We need to be aware of these rules so we can mitigate the risk of our business not being conducted within them It may be worthwhile for Peter and I to consolidate the relevant EUA provisions and the Pool Rules into one reference resource for the commercial group Regards Rob Forwarded by Robert HemstockCALECT on AM Kayan Brown on AM To Robert CT
