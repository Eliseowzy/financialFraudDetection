and Networks Now that youre the new Networks guru I thought you might be interested in the attached front page story in the most recent Texas Lawyer regarding our Firms ecommerce practice and specifically our work for TradeRanger the BPShellOccidentaletc BB exchange Wed like to introduce you to Rick Bays and Chip Rainey or reintroduce you to Rick to explore ways in which they can help Enron in its ecommerce initiatives they really do know their stuff better than anyone else in this region Don Wood or I will follow up with you on this soon Let me know TEXAS LAWYER Oct The Need For Speed Want to Do Legal Work for a BB Company Better Put on Your Running Shoes by BRENDA SAPINO JEFFREYS Talk about moving at Internet speed Locke Liddell Sapp lawyers John Chip Rainey and Richard Bays met with officials at TradeRanger a new businesstobusiness company in Houston at oclock one morning in May Less than six hours after they gave their pitch at a beauty contest Rainey was toiling away at the company then known as Energy and Petrochemical Exchange If you are going to represent ecommerce clients you better respond in espeed because thats how fast it goes says Bays head of the firms technology and commercial transactions group Thats the sort of mentality that really is prevalent in the startups whether its an Internet startup with a large corporation or two people in the garage Since that hectic day in May Rainey has spent virtually all his working hours at TradeRangers temporary offices in Houston helping the global Internet marketplace gear up for operations which began Sept While its unusual but not unprecedented for lawyers to work at a clients offices Rainey an associate isnt the only one on temporary assignment at TradeRanger Every one of the approximately people working at the fledgling exchange company is either a consultant or an employee of one of the founding companies in the BB company Even the two energyindustry executives heading the company are seconder onloan employees Rainey says he is essentially acting as a general counsel and running a legal help desk where TradeRanger workers can get quick reviews on legal issues The questions most often deal with are humanresource issues as the company prepares to staff up with permanent employees with immigration issues related to visas or with rules and regulations on imports and exports Locke Liddell lawyers also are helping on antitrust issues which is a concern since the investors in the new company are energy and petrochemical companies from around the world Some compete Rainey says while TradeRanger did not go through a HartScottRodino process two of the investors BP and Royal DutchShell chose to file with antitrust regulators in the United States The Federal Trade Commission and the US Department of Justice took no actions on those filings he says effectively giving approval to the business plan Meanwhile BP and Shell along with investors The Dow Chemical Co Tosco and Unocal filed similar paperwork with the European Unions Mergers Taskforce he says That agency also did not object according to Rainey The TradeRanger business plan calls for setting up an online marketplace where members can buy everything they need to do business and also sell products to other members Peter Lamell one of two interim chief executive officers says it should reduce costs for members They are aiming to develop a way of using ecommerce to make the purchasing process more efficient and speedy he says The membership is open although its targeted at the energy industry Products sold through TradeRanger will include drill bits to gas pumps to cans of oil found on convenience store shelves Its not an exchange for energy commodities The Right Culture TradeRanger has been moving at espeed from the start Lamell who was global vice president for Shell Internet Works before taking the temporary assignment at TradeRanger says he and a handful of people from a number of companies came together in Houston in April to get the company up and running The workers hail from countries says Lamell who has spent much of his career with Shell in Australia Lamell says he flew into Houston on a Wednesday and by Sunday the first group of onloan employees was moving into temporary offices A month later TradeRanger held a beauty contest for Houston firms with experience in the energy industry and with dotcom companies Lamell wont identify the other contenders Locke Liddell got the job because Bays and Rainey were enthusiastic Lamell says noting that everyone at TradeRanger has been working hour days often seven days a week Thats pretty important for us because we are really trying to build the right culture says Lamell Clearly speed is part of that culture Rainey says he and Bays interviewed for the job at am with the BP executive who is the interim chief financial officer for TradeRanger At am they got a call asking them to respond via email within an hour to six questions Rainey says the questions were interesting The TradeRanger executives wanted to know for instance how the executives would bill the company and then to list their six top concerns with an Internet exchange I found it very refreshing that they were questions aimed at the legal issues instead of clearly rsumtype questions Rainey says The firm was hired under an alternative fee arrangement that includes an hourly component he says Rainey says he has spent percent of his working time at TradeRanger or on company projects since he started working there Others from the firms technology group working at TradeRanger are associates Berne Kluber and Barbara Radmonovich and senior counsel Jill McDonald The work for the startup runs the gamut he says including contracts for the companys permanent offices intellectual property work related to the firms branding trade issues stemming from the import and export of goods and employee benefits packages Antitrust questions come up across the board he says We want to make sure that not only de facto but de jure they are neutral and fair and dont do anything thats anticompetitive he says Initial funding for TradeRanger is coming from the shareholders Theres no timeframe for an initial public offering according to Rainey and Lamell Revenues will come from membership fees and transaction fees and later auctions Rainey says Lamell says TradeRanger will staff up this fall and have about permanent employees in place by the end of the year Because the organization will be lean he says many functions will be outsourced such as accounting and communications There are no plans to build an inhouse legal department Rainey says Beauty Contests Firm consultant William Cobb of Houston says he expects more and more companies especially startups in the New Economy to require outside lawyers to work on site While startups typically cannot afford to hire a general counsel right off the bat or need time to find the right one they have a constant need for legal advice An outside counsel working on site can solve that problem he says They are making deals so fast they dont have time to call a lawyer he says Cobb says firms need to accommodate requests to truly provide seamless service even though that can require firms to shuffle work among lawyers back at the home base But he suggests that clients will be more satisfied because they get full attention from lawyers who are in the building When you get them back in the office they are going to be torn thinking Ive got a telephone call coming in from blah blah and a telephone call coming in from so and so he says To a degree though its a paradox for dotcom companies to want a lawyer down the hall rather than a mouse click away suggests Kenneth Hawari head of the corporate section at Hughes Luce in Dallas You would think Internet companies particularly would be perfectly satisfied to handle things virtually but frankly they are like any other client that wants proximity Hawari says Hawari and Terry Schpok a partner in Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld another firm targeting New Economy clients can cite recent instances when their firms have been hired in speedy fashion by a dotcom following a beauty contest Schpok a partner in Akin Gump in Dallas and chairman in Texas for Akin Gump Technology Ventures says its because New Economy companies often have pressing legal needs Sometimes they dont even realize how much they need a lawyer until after they hold a beauty contest and contestants point out some areas where they might run into problems without legal advice An old economy large company that conducts a beauty contest with law firms is looking at it as interviewing potential service providers Schpok says An
