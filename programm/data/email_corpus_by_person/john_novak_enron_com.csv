According to verbal understandings with outside counsels since the violation is a minor crime the prosecutors should have tried a settlement before offering the indictment One the other hand the judge has not yet formally received the indictment In that view one of our possible defenses is to try to reverse this situation and propose a settlement before the acceptance of the indictment by the judge so that GasMat would be free from the years probation period However even if GasMat does a settlement it would still face a future limitation in which it wont be able to benefit from Law Law of Special Judgements for minor violations but in neither the cases GasMat will be considered a primary convict Not to be able to benefit from Law would be a problem if the prosecutors office decides to offer an indictment based on the other two Autos de Infrao issued by IBAMA Apparently the only way to be absolutely free for any charge is by presenting the defense on the proceeding and proving that
