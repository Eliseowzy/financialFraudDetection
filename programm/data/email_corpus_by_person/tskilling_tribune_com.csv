your plate and I cant adequetely thank you for agreeing to do it I really passed this on to you with some misgivings knowing how often I get requests for talks for which there is just no timeand youre hit with times the number of inquiries that pass this desk Thanks again Jeff You are certainly a hit in the meterological community and there is much interest in what you have to say I get such a kick out of my brother I continue to follow the whole California thing and all the news from Enron via the various business news services I still chuckle when I think of our hikes with Willy to the Watchung Mountains and the various forts and treehouses we contructed along the way from rejected scrap wood picked up at construction sites and contrast all that to the lives we lead today Who would have thought Youre doing a great job in a challenging environment and Im sorry to have added anything to an already busy work load with this But I do thank you Jeff Preparations are underway for Mark
