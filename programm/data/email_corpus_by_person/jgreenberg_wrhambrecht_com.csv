him but many months ago i checked out some of his videos from the public library i dont use the videos anymore given that i like going to actual classes so much more but it was a good way to ease back into practicing i would love to take a class with him whenever i check the schedule for piedmont yoga though hes off in some farflung place maybe ill just have to do one of the workshops with him somedaywhen exactly is the one in alaska here i usually go to the mill valley yoga studio which is close to my house there are teachers there who i really like theyre very different which is part of what i like one sounds like your portland teacher the other is more gentle theres also another one who is such a lively spirit that her classes are fun and invigorating even if less focused or rigorous it sounds like youve gotten quite serious about yoga do you practice every day my brother scott who i think you met once also does a lot of yoga now that hes moved back here from new mexico after a sad divorce im always trying to get him to talk with some of the cute sexy women in the yoga classes but like you hes very shy speaking of which being a fool is a good thing in my book if by that you mean romantic and dreamy but just remember bold fools have more fun do you remember that borges poem i had on my desk the one that started in translation if i had my life to live over again id make more mistakes and then theres goethe who wrote the oftquoted whatever you dream you can do begin it boldness has genuis power and magic in it begin it now anywayim babbling as im prone to do ill write again soon and promise to answer more of your questions ie about my work jakes activities etc in the meantime i need to get back to work i will definitely stay in touch we miss seeing you too wouldnt it be great to have dinner again at that old picnic table outside overlooking a garden in its prime to answer one more question i do have a garden now a small one but its in shade much of the day so its full of flowers rather than veggies its also got a large redwood and an inviting hammock underneath and this time instead of lily the dog as frequent visitor we get oscar the cat keep watering those plants love jules Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday June PM To Julie Greenberg Subject RE are you there Jules its great to hear from you i sometimes wonder what you and jake are up to im happy you got in touch ahhhh the flowergirl she still brings a smile to my face heh heh im still a fool if youre wondering Im in Calgary unfortunately not close to Vancouver it is near banff though if youre coming up and have some time to spend is the ironman in vancouver when sounds tough what are you up to What is WRHambrecht financial are you still editing or writing Is Jake still working on New Mexico public land etc for his dissertation wish i could have you guys over for dinner and catch up i make it down to the bay area every once in awhile and will have to look you up next time yoga has been good ive been doing almost entirely ashtanga lately mostly because i havent found a good teacher up here i find ashtanga very tolerant of mediocre teaching I found a great teacher in Portland I think you would have dug her as she reminds me of you come to think of it Not like any yoga Ive taken in the past very hard she was a rock climber and distilled classes into really difficult and subtlely spiritual journeys we would try some really hard poses like scorpion and handstands with pushups while youre vertical lots of pranayama she was one of these yogis who is and looks like where are you taking yoga down there remember rodney yee im going up to homer alaska for a weekend retreat in july with him im stoked probably spend a week up there not sure what im going to do i miss california its a special place i really miss the cheese board i learned alot from you and jake and wish i still saw you i like calgary its sort of a mans town like most midwestern towns i dont think i fit in particularly well but not sure i would settle down here but its a pleasant place to spend some time the winters are brutal and the summers are glorious unfortunately we had a really shitty ski season last year i had my hopes set on learning to telemark but it didnt work out canadians are great they like to dis americans but then who doesnt working at Enron has been good so far its odd to look back at working at the lab i miss that time it would be especially fun to work there now with all the focus on energy although GW in the white house would make it difficult like calgary im not sure im comfortable settling down with Enron but its been worthwhile so far not at all what i expected when i started no one knew what pknow what is going on and what exactly these corporations are up to i usedower trading was about and now that its in the news even my mom wants to to spend alot of time analyzing the california power market and it was like watching a trainwreck in slow motion i spend alot of time now staring at numbers kind of a weird existence cant attach alot of meaning to it but its challenging and satisfying well its great to hear from you after all this time do you have a garden now ive never had a garden like the one we had up on maybeck im trying to grow some plants now but its tough in the middle of the city keep in touch and say hi to jake for me
