<3347609.1075846148803.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,linda.lawrence@enron.com,2000-02-23 09:58:00,Commission Meeting February Hengerers summary of todays Commission meeting February MEMORANDUM TO Interested Clients FROM John Hengerer RE Commission Meeting February At todays meeting the Commissioners approved the consent agenda and discussed the following items HYDRO AGENDA Public Utility District No of Okanogan County Washington Docket No P This draft order rescinded the hydro license issued to Public Utility District No of Okanogan County Washington Utility District after the National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS conditioned the license on construction of a fish ladder that would have rendered the proposed project uneconomic Commissioner Hebert moved the item to the discussion agenda to highlight the difficulties incurred in hydro licensing proceedings due to the conditioning authority granted to certain federal agencies such as NMFS Because such agencies possess the authority to impose costly environmental conditions Commission Hebert stated they essentially hold veto power over project applications Commissioner Hebert urged federal agencies to weigh potential public benefits before imposing costly environmental conditions that doom proposed projects Avista Corporation Docket No P In this draft order the Commission granted a hydro license to Avista Corporation Chairman Hoecker moved the item to the discussion agenda to champion the use of alternate licensing procedures and applaud the parties for negotiating the settlement approved by the draft order Avista began negotiating for the license in and eventually reached a settlement with stakeholders According to Chairman Hebert such negotiations maximize benefits reduce application costs and set a positive example for other parties to follow Although the other Commissioners generally echoed Chairman Hoeckers praise Commissioner Hebert criticized the draft order for not quantifying the environmental benefits of Avistas proposed project ELECTRIC MATTERS New England Power Pool ISO New England Docket Nos ER et al Price caps on the ISOs Operating Reserve and Operable Capability markets were extended by the Commission in this draft order Commissioner Hebert dissenting Both caps expired on December The cap on the Operating Reserve Market was extended until June or until the ISO submits a market redesign plan to correct market flaws The cap on the Operable Capability Market was extended until February after which the market will be terminated According to the ISOs filing which was approved in this draft order the Operable Capability Market duplicates other ISO markets and is no longer needed Commissioner Hebert dissented and moved the item to the discussion agenda to express his disapproval of price caps both in general and in this particular proceeding In general Commissioner Hebert believes that price caps remove the natural incentives created by a competitive market In this particular proceeding Commission Hebert argues that supposedly temporary price caps have become a Acrutch relied on by the ISO Moreover Commissioner Hebert does not believe that the ISO market is flawed and contends that the ISO has failed to illustrate the existence of any flaws For these reasons Commissioner Hebert would not have extended the price caps Regional Transmission Organizations Order on Rehearing Docket No RM In this draft rehearing order while making relatively minor clarifications and revisions the Commission unanimously affirmed the policy decisions outlined in Order No FERC Issued in December Order No outlined the Commissions policy with regard to RTO formation and adopted regulations governing the filing and review of RTO proposals This draft order affirmed the voluntary and flexible approach adopted by Order No as well as the RTO functions and characteristics outlined in that order However the draft order does include a number of relatively minor revisions and clarifications Specifically the draft order i denies requests to phase out passive ownership of RTO facilities by transmission owners but clarifies that passive owners must not interfere with daytoday RTO operations ii clarifies Section tariff filing rights by reiterating that RTOs should have control of their own tariffs while transmission owners should determine their own return on equity iii incorporates Order No s audit requirements into Commission regulations while ruling that the both an RTOs ownership and governance structures are subject to audit and iv clarifies that public utility compliance filings must specify what efforts were made to include RTO participation by public cooperatives In approving the draft rehearing order only two months after the issuance of Order No the Commission hopes that the ongoing collaborative process will be able to focus on the basic elements of RTO formation rather than on the contentious issues raised in the rehearing requests Order No s collaborative process began this month and is scheduled to run through April Public Utilities not currently participating in a regional transmission entity are required to make a compliance filing by October while those utilities that are already a part of a regional entity must make a compliance filing by January Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator et al Docket Nos ER et al In this draft order the Commission unanimously Commissioner Massey concurring voiced its support for the binary RTO model proposed in this proceeding but declined to issue the requested declaratory order until a final proposal is filed The binary model proposed by Midwest ISO participants would require the ISO to delegate certain functions to a forprofit transco while retaining other functions and maintaining responsibility for overseeing the transcos activities The draft order commends parties for developing the proposal and finds that the proposed binary model generally conforms to the Commissions RTO mandate However the Commission declined to make a final determination until a complete proposal is submitted Commissioner Masseys concurrence raises concerns associated with the sharing of power between an ISO and a transco Commissioner Massey believes that such a division of power may be counterproductive and urges the parties to address the issue in their final filing PIPELINE MATTERS ANR Pipeline Company Docket No CP ANRs proposal to increase mainline capacity from Joliet Illinois into Wisconsin was approved in this draft order Specifically the draft order permits ANR to construct an additional horsepower of mainline capacity thereby increasing mainline capacity into Wisconsin by Dthday by November The Commission approved ANRs proposal after concluding that demand in Wisconsin justifies the expansion The expansion approved in this draft order is part of ANRs SupplyLink proposal to be built in conjunction with the IndependenceMarketLink project ANR decided to proceed with the JoliettoWisconsin expansion after the SupplyLinkIndependenceMarketLink project was delayed due to Commission concerns that the project was not adequately supported by market demand Although the expansion approved in this draft order was unrelated to the contentious portions of the larger project Commissioner Hebert nonetheless moved the item to the discussion agenda to express his belief that market demand justifies the IndependenceMarketLink project Specifically Commissioner Hebert cited recent spikes in heating oil prices as evidence that gas demand in the northeastern United States more than justifies the project Commissioner Breathitt disagreed with Commission Hebert and argued that the price of heating oil does not necessarily correlate to natural gas demand
<29328889.1075846155042.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,linda.lawrence@enron.com,2000-05-17 09:35:00,May Commission Meeting Via Internet MEMORANDUM TO Interested Clients FROM John Hengerer RE Commission Meeting May At todays meeting the Commissioners approved the consent agenda and then discussed the following items ELECTRIC MATTERS Alliance Companies et al Docket Nos ER In December the Commission issued an order conditionally authorizing the formation of the Alliance RTO At todays meeting the Commissioners denied by a margin of to Commissioner Hebert dissenting rehearing of the December order The Commissioners also unanimously rejected Commissioner Massey concurring Alliances compliance filing In its original filing Alliance proposed allowing each of its active owners to retain up to a percent ownership interest in the RTO up to percent total ownership by active owners The December order rejected this proposal as contrary to the independence principle outlined in Order No which states that active ownership should be limited to a total of percent unless special circumstances are shown Rejecting requests for rehearing the majority concluded that Alliance had failed to justify active member ownership in excess of percent Dissenting Commissioner Hebert argued that i the percent benchmark is arbitrary and should not be viewed as creating a binding legal requirement and ii limiting active ownership will provide a disincentive for other utilities to join the RTO The Commissioners also rejected Alliances compliance filing submitted to satisfy the terms of the December order In addition to failing to correct the active ownership issue outlined above the Commissioners faulted Alliance for not eliminating pancaked rates and for not addressing issues associated with the RTOs scope and configuration Commissioner Massey indicated that he would write a concurrence to stress that Aseams agreements do not negate the need to review the RTOs scope and configuration to ensure that it is properly designed and sized Southwest Power Pool Docket No EL The Commissioners unanimously rejected as failing to meet the requirements of Order No the Southwest Power Pools SPP RTO proposal Commissioner Massey who moved the item to the discussion agenda cited the following shortcomings in SPPs proposal i operational control of transmission facilities was not turned over to the RTO ii the RTOs proposed openaccess transmission tariff did not comply with Order No iii no realtime balancing market had been proposed iv lingering concerns with the RTOs governance structure and v the RTOs proposed scope and configuration are inadequate Commissioner Massey encouraged the SPP to join other entities seeking to form an RTO or consider merging with the Midwest ISO Notice of Interim Procedures to Support Reliability and Request for Comments Docket No EL The Commissioners unanimously approved shortterm procedures designed to address Summer reliability concerns The approved measures provide for i streamlining FERC procedures to promote onsite distributed generation ii waiving priornotice requirements for loadreduction agreements iii improving demandside price signals iv requiring more extensive OASIS posting of available transmission capacity and v making Commission Staff more available to the industry to address reliability concerns Comments on the proposed shortterm measures are due by June Additionally agreeing that the shortterm procedures are very minimal in nature the Commissioners requested comments on longterm reliability issues Comments are due by June Finally Commissioner Hebert indicated that he would write a separate concurrence to express his belief that competitive forces are the answer to reliability concerns and to criticize the Commission for not eliminating artificial price caps and promoting competitive rates Commissioner Heberts accusation that the Commission was more concerned with politics than good policy touched off a heated debate with Chairman Hoecker reciting FERC successes and Commissioner Massey scoffing at Commissioner Heberts suggestion that price caps were to blame for generation shortages GAS MATTERS Regulation of ShortTerm Natural Gas Transportation Services Regulation of Interstate Natural Gas Transportation Services Docket Nos RM RM The Commissioners unanimously addressed and generally denied requests for rehearing of Order No Finding that Order No strikes a good balance between competing interests the Commissioners indicated that their order would with several exceptions uphold the mandates of the order The Commissioners expressly noted that requests for rehearing of rightoffirstrefusal ROFR rollup issues would be denied Order No states that if a pipeline is fully subscribed a party wishing to exercise a ROFR will be required to match competing bids even if a competing bid exceeds the maximum rate for the capacity Revisions and clarifications of Order No approved by the Commissioners at todays meeting include shippers with multiyear contracts at max rates for seasonal service will retain their ROFR pipelines will be required to post available capacity within one hour of each nomination cycle rather than within one day as directed by Order shortterm capacity release transactions must be posted within one hour of the first nomination under the contract rather than upon the execution of the contract as stated in Order No and Order No s OFO penalty and imbalance provisions will be clarified in the Commission order Although comments at todays meeting were brief we anticipate a lengthy order addressing the numerous issues raised by parties in their requests for rehearing

<31108269.1075846162283.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,linda.lawrence@enron.com,2000-08-01 06:25:00,Mr Steven Kean of Enron Corp please see below Appendix C Order Allegations of Public Utilities Exercising Transmission Dominance APPENDIX C Allegations of Public Utilities Exercising Transmission Dominance I Examples From Proceedings Before Administrative Law Judges These are examples of allegations that various public utilities have refused to provide comparable service either through refusals to wheel dilatory tactics that so protracted negotiations as to effectively deny wheeling refusals to provide service priority equal to native load or refusals to provide service flexibility equivalent to the utilitys own use A American Electric Power Service Corp AEP In AEP filed on behalf of its public utility associate companies an open access tariff that offered only firm pointtopoint service with very limited flexibility It did not offer network service flexible pointtopoint service or non firm service Thus it did not provide customers with the same flexibility that AEP itself has Nor did it provide a service priority equivalent to that enjoyed by native load The Commission set AEPs tariff for hearing and on rehearing held that in order not to be unduly discriminatory the tariff had to offer comparable service American Electric Power Service Corp FERC F rehg FERC F At hearing Raj Rao of Indiana Michigan Power Agency IMPA Ex IMPA Feb and Kenneth Hegemann of American Municipal PowerOhio Inc AMPOhio Ex AMPO Feb both senior management officials testified concerning AEPs F alleged discriminatory practices AMPOhio is an association of municipalities in Ohio some of whose members depend on AEP for transmission and partial requirements service IMPA is an association of municipalities in Indiana and many of IMPAs loads are captive to the AEP transmission system The witnesses alleged as follows In anticipation of high peak demands AEP would contract for large blocks of available shortterm power withhold sale of shortterm power refuse to transmit third party shortterm power and require purchases from AEP at the emergency rate millkwh when an emergency might not exist Ex AMPO at In December AMPOhio negotiated a MW purchase of shortterm power from Louisville Gas Electric Company LGE AEP refused to wheel because LGE had earlier that day told AEP it had no power to sell to AEP AEP then bought the power from LGE and offered to resell it to AMPOhio Ex AMPO at In January AMPOhio solicited bids for February power purchases from a number of utilities including AEP AEP was not the winning bid AMPOhio made arrangements to purchase the power from four winning bidders and sought transmission through AEP When AMPOhio gave AEP After the Rehearing Order expanding the scope of the proceeding AMPOhio and IMPA withdrew this testimony as no longer necessary This withdrawal does not change the fact that the testimony was sworn to under oath F the schedule for delivery AEP refused to transmit the power matched the average price of the winning bids and made the sale itself Ex AMPO at In August an AMPOhio member Columbus Ohio was purchasing MW of hourly nondisplacement power from AEP and after AEP raised its price to millskwh sought another source for the next hour Consumers Power Company and Detroit Edison Company both offered nondisplacement power at mills AEP refused to transmit saying it had a MW unit out and could not resell power from another source Columbus cancelled the transaction and had to buy MW of power from AEP at millskwh Ex AMPO at In July two AMPOhio members Columbus and St Marys had been buying hourly nondisplacement power from AEP when the price rose to mills Dayton Power Light Company DPL offered to sell at mills and AEP agreed to transmit for one hour But for the next hour AEP said it had problems with its system refused to transmit the power kept the power from DPL for itself and offered to sell power to AMPOhio for Columbus and St Marys at AEP generally limited its offer of shortterm transmission to buysell transactions that is AEP would buy the power from the seller and resell it to the purchaser Supplemental testimony of AEP Witness Baker Ex A at Often the terms of the buysell transaction required transmission dependent utilities TDUs to maintain reserves and meet contractual commitments for at least a year Id F mills Columbus increased its local generation but St Marys purchased MW at mills For the next hour AMP Ohio arranged with DPL for another MW hoping AEP would transmit under the hour buysell agreement AEP did transmit this power Seven hours later in the day St Marys Greenup Hydro project power was available and the MW from DPL was no longer needed If St Marys had been receiving the hourly power that AEP had refused to transmit St Marys could have switched to Greenup power But because AMPOhio had changed to daily service St Marys had to pay a demand charge for the entire day even though it used the power only hours and would have paid less under the hourly rate Ex AMPO at In January AMPOhio sought to transfer power from one member with generation to other members which required transmission over AEP and Toledo Edison lines Toledo Edison said yes AEP said no AMPOhios northern members purchased emergency power from Toledo Edison AMP Ohio then reminded AEP that it had agreed not to deny transmission and AEP agreed to transmit Ex AMPO at IMPA arranged to buy MW of shortterm power from LGE and have it wheeled using buysell arrangements through Public Service Company of Indiana PSI and AEP to serve IMPAs load at Richmond an IMPA member The delivered price was per kWday plus a mill adder At the same time AEP arranged to buy MW from PSI at F per kW day plus outofpocket energy costs Hence PSI was shipping a total of MW to AEP with MW of that amount to be delivered to IMPAs load at Richmond Then on a day when IMPA should have received the MW AEP told IMPA that PSI had sold everything to AEP and that IMPA would have to buy from AEP at per kW day plus the cost of energy from AEP IMPA purchased from AEP under protest AEP used its control over transmission to intercept the MW at a lower price and resell it as shortterm power to IMPA AEP claimed that PSI had terminated its sales to AEP on that day But the MW was independent of PSIs other sales to AEP and would not have been interrupted if AEP had not interrupted it IMPA at IMPA has combustion turbines owned by and located at one member which IMPA would like to connect to the Joint Transmission System owned by IMPA CINergy and Wabash Valley Power Association To do so IMPA needed a metering agreement with AEP to which AEP would not agree IMPA at In January IMPA had power to sell from its turbines when AEP and others needed power IMPA offered power to AEP but AEP it said could not purchase the power without an existing contract Moreover since there was no shortterm tariff IMPA could not sell the power to another utility IMPA at Another example of the utility engaging in F dilatory tactics that raised the customers transaction costs and effectively denied transmission is the sham transaction provision proposed by AEP As filed AEPs tariffs permitted it to deny service merely because a portion of the transmitted power might be used to serve a former retail customer of AEP See eg Ex BRWVP J Bertram Solomon testimony February As part of a settlement AEP filed the pro forma tariff and withdrew this provision Finally AEPs originally filed tariff contained a prodigal customer provision Under this provision transmission customers who sought to convert back to requirements service had to give AEP five years notice in which case AEP and the customer would enter into negotiations to determine whether AEP will provide service at all and if so under what rate terms and conditions Ex S at Staff testimony AEP did not require notice from all new customers only from prodigal customers Id at That a potential customer was previously served by AEP is not a reason to treat the customer differently AEP withdrew this provision when it filed the pro forma tariff B Entergy Services Inc Entergy Entergy filed a partial settlement largely adopting the NOPR pro forma tariffs except for two provisions headroom and ancillary services Because the settlement predated the filing date for customer testimony before the ALJ the customers did not F address the need for Entergy to file a tariff However customers did make allegations of discriminatory practices as follows Customers alleged that Entergy flatout refused to wheel Louisiana Energy and Power Authority LEPA witness Sylvan J Richard testified that LEPAs predecessor systems could not obtain interconnections from Entergy Ex SJR at Customers also alleged that Entergy refused to provide service priority equal to native load and refused to provide service flexibility equivalent to the utilitys own use For example LEPA witness Richard testified that even after state commissions ordered interconnections and other coordination services LEPAs predecessors were still not able to obtain coordination services because Entergy was not willing to coordinate and because the transmission service it did offer was inflexible unidirectional pointtopoint service which prevented economic coordination with others Id at South Mississippi Electric Power Association SMEPA witness J Bertram Solomon testified that Entergys original open access tariff was restricted to pointto point service proposed separate charges for each operating company and required the cancellation of existing agreements in order to take service under the proposed tariff Ex SMEPA at Entergy eventually filed a F network tariff but proposed different local facilities charges for the various Entergy public utility operating subsidiaries Id at Since these local facilities charges were higher than the transmission component of the subsidiaries bundled rates Entergy obtained a competitive advantage Id The Arkansas Cities and Cooperatives ACC is a group of cities and cooperatives that own or operate electric generation or distribution systems in Arkansas ACC Witness Steven Merchant testified that Entergy has segregated the wholesale market between two of its subsidiaries Arkansas Power Light Copmpany APL and Entergy Power Inc EPI Ex SMM at In marketing power and energy in Arkansas EPI is subject to an Arkansas Commission order that bars EPI from competing with APL for wholesale loads without first obtaining a waiver Id Recently EPI requested this waiver for all wholesale transactions in Arkansas except for wholesale customers currently served by an Entergy subsidiary in other words EPI requested the Arkansas Commission to expand competition for all wholesale customers except where EPI might compete with APL Id ACC witness Merchant concluded that since EPI does not compete with APL Entergy insulates APLs wholesale business from competition and denies those wholesale customers access to EPI as a source of power thereby limiting alternative generation sources available to F ACC Id at Entergys witness Kenney stated that Entergy has recently filed a joint motion with ACC to the Arkansas Commission seeking to extend the waiver and permit EPI to sell to APLs wholesale customers Ex JFK at C Pacific Gas Electric Company

November Bill Carnahan was the director for Riverside Carnahan testimony at November Gordon Hoyt was the general manager of the Anaheim power department Hoyt testimony at November Dan McCann was the power coordination supervisor for Anaheim He supervised Anaheims load scheduling and is a former Edison employee having worked for Edison for years McCann Testimony at November These witnesses testified that Edison refused to wheel as follows Edisons policy was to curtail the Cities any time it could be justified using any of a list of acceptable reasons to deny interruptible transmission service Id at Edison would not generally provide transmission service when Edison could save money by itself purchasing the economy energy that would be wheeled McCann testimony at The Cities called Edison every hour to request interruptible transmission service Id Edison often F refused to sell energy available in the Western Systems Power Pool to the Cities and then made available higher cost contract energy or partial requirements service Id at When Anaheim requested Edison provide firm transmission of power from neighboring states Edison would often agree to provide nonfirm service but would not integrate the capacity for many years in the future saying that its control area did not need capacity at that time Hoyt testimony at Since the selling utility was interested in a sale of capacity not just energy the transaction would not occur Id Edison repeatedly used its control over transmission to deny Anaheim access to low cost firm power Id at While Edison provided shortterm firm transmission service to the Cities it would only provide longterm firm service for three specific resources the SONGS nuclear plant a specific IPP and Hoover Dam power Hoyt testimony at One of Edisons reasons for denying longterm transmission was that Edison desired to reserve the transmission for its own future unspecified needs Id In the s Edison refused to allow the Cities access to the Pacific Intertie Hoyt testimony at Drews testimony at In Edison refused to provide transmission service for a Cities power purchase from Public Service F Company of New Mexico PSNM from Palo Verde Nuclear station Hoyt testimony at Edison has refused to provide requested firm transmission from CaliforniaOregon border to Midway Station NevadaOregon Border to Sylmar Substation Palo Verde Switchyard to Vista SONGS Switchyard to Vista Carnahan testimony at Riverside requested transmission from Palo Verde and was told that such service was not available Carnahan testimony at Edison offered Riverside only MW of curtailable transmission entitlement to provide Riversides share of Palo Verde Id This service was neither large enough or long enough and Edison insisted on unreasonable terms and conditions Id Azusa Banning and Colton had a contract with Edison that entitled them to use their Palo Verde firm transmission path to schedule energy to meet their contract energy obligation Edison refused to permit the three cities to use that path Edison did not contest that the contracts allowed this use but said that the scheduling of such small amounts of energy for the three cities would be too burdensome Greenwalt testimony at Edison would not respond in a timely manner to the Cities requests routinely taking months to respond Drews F testimony at During the s Edison provided Colton with some transmission service to allow the Cities to reach certain suppliers but limited the choices available to the Cities and imposed terms and conditions that increased the Cities costs and placed Colton at a disadvantage against Edison Drews testimony at Arranging alternative generation sources was difficult because the Cities always had to first get Edison to state whether it would provide transmission During and a dispute arose between Edison and the Cities concerning the Hoover Uprating Project Drews testimony at Edison argued that for the months when units were out of service for uprating and Southern Cities capacity was reduced to zero Southern Cities would not receive an energy credit even though energy was still available and used by Edison But the contracts allowed a participant who did not have capacity to still schedule its energy as nonfirm energy on the capacity of another participant Id at In Azusa negotiated a power purchase contract with the California Department of Water Resources in increments of first MW and then MW for a total of MW Hsu testimony at First Edison assured Azusa that the transmission for the additional MW would not be a problem Id Then Edison would not agree to amend the transmission service agreement for the additional MW Id F In Azusa notified Edison of Special Condition purchases from PGE and requested firm transmission service Id Two months before service was to begin Edison notified the Cities of a problem with the transmission lines Id Transmission was eventually granted but only after a fourmonth delay and substantial losses to the Cities Id Then Edison decided there was no problem with its transmission facilities Id at In the Cities purchased MW from PGE and MW from Deseret GT Cooperative Hoyt testimony at Edison stated that without reinforcement of its transmission system Edison would not provide the transmission Id There was a fivemonth delay during which the Cities were forced to purchase from Edison at a higher cost Id at Then Edison decided that the transmission system did not need reinforcement Id at Edison also refused to provide a service priority equal to that of native load It would curtail the Cities in order to purchase more economy energy for itself McCann testimony at If Edison could make the purchase it would curtail the City and use the energy for itself Id When Edison curtailed the Cities they were not able to Special Condition of the Integrated Operations Agreement between Edison and the Southern Cities defined certain Special Condition resources and allowed the Cities to make certain uses of those resources subject to certain restrictions F purchase economy energy and instead purchased energy from Edison Id at According to Edison the interruptible transmission it provided the Cities was interruptible for any reason Id at A purchase could be terminated the hour after it is begun or even during the hour Id As a result the Cities lost opportunities to make advantageous economy purchases Id at Edison also refused to provide customers flexibility similar to the flexibility Edison provided itself Edisons refusal to provide bidirectional transmission service restricted the Cities abilities to purchase hydroelectric energy from the Pacific Northwest Hoyt testimony at Because most contracts with Northwest utilities require a return of power the Northwest utilities would not deal with the Cities without transmission to return energy Id at Edison did provide bi directional transmission to the Los Angeles Department of Water Power LADWP to accommodate flows to and from Arizona Id Riverside was unable to obtain nonfirm service more than two hours in advance of need Carnahan testimony at Riverside and Colton were both served out of Edisons Vista substation Although the two cities were on the same kV bus Edison would not allow them to sell F energy to each other Greenwalt testimony at Riversides agreement with Edison allowed Riverside to purchase a block of energy through the WSPP and divide it up among the four Cities Azusa Banning Colton and Riverside Greenwalt testimony at When Riverside had excess energy from other sources Edison would not permit it to sell that energy to the other three cities Id For example Riverside attempted to sell Deseret energy transmitted by LADWP to the Edison system Id at LADWP would not break out the Cities shares of that energy and Edison would not accept the energy as a delivery for all four cities Id at Edison argued that because this energy was excess energy that Riverside could not use Riverside did not have transmission rights to bring it into the control area Id As a result Riverside paid for the energy delivered by LADWP to the Edison control area but could not sell it to the other three cities and gave it to Edison itself which consumed the energy without making any payment for it Id Riverside tried a number of alternative paths including using WSPP transmission where Riverside paid Edison mills to connect to Azusa mills to connect to Banning and mills to connect to Colton for each megawatthour While this approach was successful for a while eventually Edison refused to permit these sales Edison claimed that the Cities only have transmission rights to bring in enough Special Condition F energy to satisfy the Cities load Greenwalt testimony at Edison contended that the Cities load requirements were satisfied first by integrated resources and then by Special Condition and economy energy purchases Id at When the Cities integrated resources exceeded their load any Special Condition resources became excess Under Riversides Deseret contract the Cities were required to take a minimum of MW each hour Id Edison acknowledged that it was obligated to buy or allow the Cities to sell any excess energy from Riversides integrated resources Id However Edison refused to give the Cities credit for excess Special Condition energy brought into the area claiming that the Cities could not have brought it in because they did not have transmission rights Id II Other Examples of Transmission Disputes Disputes over transmission are not uncommon contrary to EEIs suggestion Some recent examples taken from pleadings and other documents and from Commission orders reveal that it has been very difficult for various entities in the electric power industry to agree on transmission rights These examples also reveal that even after issuance of AEP and the Open Access NOPR with its proposed pro forma tariffs there has been considerable controversy over whether various utilities open access tariffs deviate from those tariffs The Commission has allowed F utilities that adopt tariffs that match or exceed the nonrate terms and conditions in the NOPR pro forma tariffs to obtain certain benefits A In a letter of February to Mr Gerald Richman of the Commissions Enforcement section in the Office of the General Counsel Steven J Kean Vice President Regulatory Affairs Enron Power Marketing Inc Enron alleged that Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation NiMo refused to wheel power from Rochester Gas Electric RGE to Enron under RGEs transmission contract with NiMo however when Enron revealed the buyer NiMo did wheel power for RGE to the buyer Mr Kean alleged that this was not an isolated incident NiMo argued that the contract did not require it to provide RGE with transmission to Enron It also said that the principle of comparability does not require the service Letter of November from NiMo representative A Karen Hill to Gerald Richman B The Commissions Task Force Hot Line Hot Line received a complaint that a member of the New York Power Pool NYPP refused to transmit power that another member bought from a power marketer In a letter of November from Chair Moler to Mr William J Balet Executive Director of NYPP Chair Moler explained that the Commissions enforcement staff had investigated and found the allegation to be true F C In Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency v Northern States Power Company Minnesota FERC F NSP and SMMPA had a contract under which NSP agreed to provide transmission service However the parties had numerous disputes over the service The Commission found that NSP had misinterpreted the contract in several ways For example SMMPA argued that it should be able to directly schedule its deliveries of energy out of the NSP control area and that it should not be limited to particular points of delivery NSP argued that only it was entitled to control the physical operation of scheduling The Commission found that the clear language of the contracts gave SMMPA the authority to schedule its own power D MidContinent Area Power Pool FERC F involved MAPPs membership criteria which made it impossible for a power marketer to join MAPP and obtain the benefits of certain transmission services available only to MAPP members The Commission found that the membership criteria may be unreasonable particularly since there may be less burdensome ways of setting up membership criteria for nontraditional entities F

Transmission Dominance APPENDIX C Allegations of Public Utilities Exercising Transmission Dominance I Examples From Proceedings Before Administrative Law Judges These are examples of allegations that various public utilities have refused to provide comparable service either through refusals to wheel dilatory tactics that so protracted negotiations as to effectively deny wheeling refusals to provide service priority equal to native load or refusals to provide service flexibility equivalent to the utilitys own use A American Electric Power Service Corp AEP In AEP filed on behalf of its public utility associate companies an open access tariff that offered only firm pointtopoint service with very limited flexibility It did not offer network service flexible pointtopoint service or non firm service Thus it did not provide customers with the same flexibility that AEP itself has Nor did it provide a service priority equivalent to that enjoyed by native load The Commission set AEPs tariff for hearing and on rehearing held that in order not to be unduly discriminatory the tariff had to offer comparable service American Electric Power Service Corp FERC F rehg FERC F At hearing Raj Rao of Indiana Michigan Power Agency IMPA Ex IMPA Feb and Kenneth Hegemann of American Municipal PowerOhio Inc AMPOhio Ex AMPO Feb both senior management officials testified concerning AEPs F alleged discriminatory practices AMPOhio is an association of municipalities in Ohio some of whose members depend on AEP for transmission and partial requirements service IMPA is an association of municipalities in Indiana and many of IMPAs loads are captive to the AEP transmission system The witnesses alleged as follows In anticipation of high peak demands AEP would contract for large blocks of available shortterm power withhold sale of shortterm power refuse to transmit third party shortterm power and require purchases from AEP at the emergency rate millkwh when an emergency might not exist Ex AMPO at In December AMPOhio negotiated a MW purchase of shortterm power from Louisville Gas Electric Company LGE AEP refused to wheel because LGE had earlier that day told AEP it had no power to sell to AEP AEP then bought the power from LGE and offered to resell it to AMPOhio Ex AMPO at In January AMPOhio solicited bids for February power purchases from a number of utilities including AEP AEP was not the winning bid AMPOhio made arrangements to purchase the power from four winning bidders and sought transmission through AEP When AMPOhio gave AEP After the Rehearing Order expanding the scope of the proceeding AMPOhio and IMPA withdrew this testimony as no longer necessary This withdrawal does not change the fact that the testimony was sworn to under oath F the schedule for delivery AEP refused to transmit the power matched the average price of the winning bids and made the sale itself Ex AMPO at In August an AMPOhio member Columbus Ohio was purchasing MW of hourly nondisplacement power from AEP and after AEP raised its price to millskwh sought another source for the next hour Consumers Power Company and Detroit Edison Company both offered nondisplacement power at mills AEP refused to transmit saying it had a MW unit out and could not resell power from another source Columbus cancelled the transaction and had to buy MW of power from AEP at millskwh Ex AMPO at In July two AMPOhio members Columbus and St Marys had been buying hourly nondisplacement power from AEP when the price rose to mills Dayton Power Light Company DPL offered to sell at mills and AEP agreed to transmit for one hour But for the next hour AEP said it had problems with its system refused to transmit the power kept the power from DPL for itself and offered to sell power to AMPOhio for Columbus and St Marys at AEP generally limited its offer of shortterm transmission to buysell transactions that is AEP would buy the power from the seller and resell it to the purchaser Supplemental testimony of AEP Witness Baker Ex A at Often the terms of the buysell transaction required transmission dependent utilities TDUs to maintain reserves and meet contractual commitments for at least a year Id F mills Columbus increased its local generation but St Marys purchased MW at mills For the next hour AMP Ohio arranged with DPL for another MW hoping AEP would transmit under the hour buysell agreement AEP did transmit this power Seven hours later in the day St Marys Greenup Hydro project power was available and the MW from DPL was no longer needed If St Marys had been receiving the hourly power that AEP had refused to transmit St Marys could have switched to Greenup power But because AMPOhio had changed to daily service St Marys had to pay a demand charge for the entire day even though it used the power only hours and would have paid less under the hourly rate Ex AMPO at In January AMPOhio sought to transfer power from one member with generation to other members which required transmission over AEP and Toledo Edison lines Toledo Edison said yes AEP said no AMPOhios northern members purchased emergency power from Toledo Edison AMP Ohio then reminded AEP that it had agreed not to deny transmission and AEP agreed to transmit Ex AMPO at IMPA arranged to buy MW of shortterm power from LGE and have it wheeled using buysell arrangements through Public Service Company of Indiana PSI and AEP to serve IMPAs load at Richmond an IMPA member The delivered price was per kWday plus a mill adder At the same time AEP arranged to buy MW from PSI at F per kW day plus outofpocket energy costs Hence PSI was shipping a total of MW to AEP with MW of that amount to be delivered to IMPAs load at Richmond Then on a day when IMPA should have received the MW AEP told IMPA that PSI had sold everything to AEP and that IMPA would have to buy from AEP at per kW day plus the cost of energy from AEP IMPA purchased from AEP under protest AEP used its control over transmission to intercept the MW at a lower price and resell it as shortterm power to IMPA AEP claimed that PSI had terminated its sales to AEP on that day But the MW was independent of PSIs other sales to AEP and would not have been interrupted if AEP had not interrupted it IMPA at IMPA has combustion turbines owned by and located at one member which IMPA would like to connect to the Joint Transmission System owned by IMPA CINergy and Wabash Valley Power Association To do so IMPA needed a metering agreement with AEP to which AEP would not agree IMPA at In January IMPA had power to sell from its turbines when AEP and others needed power IMPA offered power to AEP but AEP it said could not purchase the power without an existing contract Moreover since there was no shortterm tariff IMPA could not sell the power to another utility IMPA at Another example of the utility engaging in F dilatory tactics that raised the customers transaction costs and effectively denied transmission is the sham transaction provision proposed by AEP As filed AEPs tariffs permitted it to deny service merely because a portion of the transmitted power might be used to serve a former retail customer of AEP See eg Ex BRWVP J Bertram Solomon testimony February As part of a settlement AEP filed the pro forma tariff and withdrew this provision Finally AEPs originally filed tariff contained a prodigal customer provision Under this provision transmission customers who sought to convert back to requirements service had to give AEP five years notice in which case AEP and the customer would enter into negotiations to determine whether AEP will provide service at all and if so under what rate terms and conditions Ex S at Staff testimony AEP did not require notice from all new customers only from prodigal customers Id at That a potential customer was previously served by AEP is not a reason to treat the customer differently AEP withdrew this provision when it filed the pro forma tariff B Entergy Services Inc Entergy Entergy filed a partial settlement largely adopting the NOPR pro forma tariffs except for two provisions headroom and ancillary services Because the settlement predated the filing date for customer testimony before the ALJ the customers did not F address the need for Entergy to file a tariff However customers did make allegations of discriminatory practices as follows Customers alleged that Entergy flatout refused to wheel Louisiana Energy and Power Authority LEPA witness Sylvan J Richard testified that LEPAs predecessor systems could not obtain interconnections from Entergy Ex SJR at Customers also alleged that Entergy refused to provide service priority equal to native load and refused to provide service flexibility equivalent to the utilitys own use For example LEPA witness Richard testified that even after state commissions ordered interconnections and other coordination services LEPAs predecessors were still not able to obtain coordination services because Entergy was not willing to coordinate and because the transmission service it did offer was inflexible unidirectional pointtopoint service which prevented economic coordination with others Id at South Mississippi Electric Power Association SMEPA witness J Bertram Solomon testified that Entergys original open access tariff was restricted to pointto point service proposed separate charges for each operating company and required the cancellation of existing agreements in order to take service under the proposed tariff Ex SMEPA at Entergy eventually filed a F network tariff but proposed different local facilities charges for the various Entergy public utility operating subsidiaries Id at Since these local facilities charges were higher than the transmission component of the subsidiaries bundled rates Entergy obtained a competitive advantage Id The Arkansas Cities and Cooperatives ACC is a group of cities and cooperatives that own or operate electric generation or distribution systems in Arkansas ACC Witness Steven Merchant testified that Entergy has segregated the wholesale market between two of its subsidiaries Arkansas Power Light Copmpany APL and Entergy Power Inc EPI Ex SMM at In marketing power and energy in Arkansas EPI is subject to an Arkansas Commission order that bars EPI from competing with APL for wholesale loads without first obtaining a waiver Id Recently EPI requested this waiver for all wholesale transactions in Arkansas except for wholesale customers currently served by an Entergy subsidiary in other words EPI requested the Arkansas Commission to expand competition for all wholesale customers except where EPI might compete with APL Id ACC witness Merchant concluded that since EPI does not compete with APL Entergy insulates APLs wholesale business from competition and denies those wholesale customers access to EPI as a source of power thereby limiting alternative generation sources available to F ACC Id at Entergys witness Kenney stated that Entergy has recently filed a joint motion with ACC to the Arkansas Commission seeking to extend the waiver and permit EPI to sell to APLs wholesale customers Ex JFK at C Pacific Gas Electric Company

electric power industry to agree on transmission rights These examples also reveal that even after issuance of AEP and the Open Access NOPR with its proposed pro forma tariffs there has been considerable controversy over whether various utilities open access tariffs deviate from those tariffs The Commission has allowed F utilities that adopt tariffs that match or exceed the nonrate terms and conditions in the NOPR pro forma tariffs to obtain certain benefits A In a letter of February to Mr Gerald Richman of the Commissions Enforcement section in the Office of the General Counsel Steven J Kean Vice President Regulatory Affairs Enron Power Marketing Inc Enron alleged that Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation NiMo refused to wheel power from Rochester Gas Electric RGE to Enron under RGEs transmission contract with NiMo however when Enron revealed the buyer NiMo did wheel power for RGE to the buyer Mr Kean alleged that this was not an isolated incident NiMo argued that the contract did not require it to provide RGE with transmission to Enron It also said that the principle of comparability does not require the service Letter of November from NiMo representative A Karen Hill to Gerald Richman B The Commissions Task Force Hot Line Hot Line received a complaint that a member of the New York Power Pool NYPP refused to transmit power that another member bought from a power marketer In a letter of November from Chair Moler to Mr William J Balet Executive Director of NYPP Chair Moler explained that the Commissions enforcement staff had investigated and found the allegation to be true F C In Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency v Northern States Power Company Minnesota FERC F NSP and SMMPA had a contract under which NSP agreed to provide transmission service However the parties had numerous disputes over the service The Commission found that NSP had misinterpreted the contract in several ways For example SMMPA argued that it should be able to directly schedule its deliveries of energy out of the NSP control area and that it should not be limited to particular points of delivery NSP argued that only it was entitled to control the physical operation of scheduling The Commission found that the clear language of the contracts gave SMMPA the authority to schedule its own power D MidContinent Area Power Pool FERC F involved MAPPs membership criteria which made it impossible for a power marketer to join MAPP and obtain the benefits of certain transmission services available only to MAPP members The Commission found that the membership criteria may be unreasonable particularly since there may be less burdensome ways of setting up membership criteria for nontraditional entities F

May At todays meeting the Commissioners approved the consent agenda and then discussed the following items ELECTRIC MATTERS Alliance Companies et al Docket Nos ER In December the Commission issued an order conditionally authorizing the formation of the Alliance RTO At todays meeting the Commissioners denied by a margin of to Commissioner Hebert dissenting rehearing of the December order The Commissioners also unanimously rejected Commissioner Massey concurring Alliances compliance filing In its original filing Alliance proposed allowing each of its active owners to retain up to a percent ownership interest in the RTO up to percent total ownership by active owners The December order rejected this proposal as contrary to the independence principle outlined in Order No which states that active ownership should be limited to a total of percent unless special circumstances are shown Rejecting requests for rehearing the majority concluded that Alliance had failed to justify active member ownership in excess of percent Dissenting Commissioner Hebert argued that i the percent benchmark is arbitrary and should not be viewed as creating a binding legal requirement and ii limiting active ownership will provide a disincentive for other utilities to join the RTO The Commissioners also rejected Alliances compliance filing submitted to satisfy the terms of the December order In addition to failing to correct the active ownership issue outlined above the Commissioners faulted Alliance for not eliminating pancaked rates and for not addressing issues associated with the RTOs scope and configuration Commissioner Massey indicated that he would write a concurrence to stress that Aseams agreements do not negate the need to review the RTOs scope and configuration to ensure that it is properly designed and sized Southwest Power Pool Docket No EL The Commissioners unanimously rejected as failing to meet the requirements of Order No the Southwest Power Pools SPP RTO proposal Commissioner Massey who moved the item to the discussion agenda cited the following shortcomings in SPPs proposal i operational control of transmission facilities was not turned over to the RTO ii the RTOs proposed openaccess transmission tariff did not comply with Order No iii no realtime balancing market had been proposed iv lingering concerns with the RTOs governance structure and v the RTOs proposed scope and configuration are inadequate Commissioner Massey encouraged the SPP to join other entities seeking to form an RTO or consider merging with the Midwest ISO Notice of Interim Procedures to Support Reliability and Request for Comments Docket No EL The Commissioners unanimously approved shortterm procedures designed to address Summer reliability concerns The approved measures provide for i streamlining FERC procedures to promote onsite distributed generation ii waiving priornotice requirements for loadreduction agreements iii improving demandside price signals iv requiring more extensive OASIS posting of available transmission capacity and v making Commission Staff more available to the industry to address reliability concerns Comments on the proposed shortterm measures are due by June Additionally agreeing that the shortterm procedures are very minimal in nature the Commissioners requested comments on longterm reliability issues Comments are due by June Finally Commissioner Hebert indicated that he would write a separate concurrence to express his belief that competitive forces are the answer to reliability concerns and to criticize the Commission for not eliminating artificial price caps and promoting competitive rates Commissioner Heberts accusation that the Commission was more concerned with politics than good policy touched off a heated debate with Chairman Hoecker reciting FERC successes and Commissioner Massey scoffing at Commissioner Heberts suggestion that price caps were to blame for generation shortages GAS MATTERS Regulation of ShortTerm Natural Gas Transportation Services Regulation of Interstate Natural Gas Transportation Services Docket Nos RM RM The Commissioners unanimously addressed and generally denied requests for rehearing of Order No Finding that Order No strikes a good balance between competing interests the Commissioners indicated that their order would with several exceptions uphold the mandates of the order The Commissioners expressly noted that requests for rehearing of rightoffirstrefusal ROFR rollup issues would be denied Order No states that if a pipeline is fully subscribed a party wishing to exercise a ROFR will be required to match competing bids even if a competing bid exceeds the maximum rate for the capacity Revisions and clarifications of Order No approved by the Commissioners at todays meeting include shippers with multiyear contracts at max rates for seasonal service will retain their ROFR pipelines will be required to post available capacity within one hour of each nomination cycle rather than within one day as directed by Order shortterm capacity release transactions must be posted within one hour of the first nomination under the contract rather than upon the execution of the contract as stated in Order No and Order No s OFO penalty and imbalance provisions will be clarified in the Commission order Although comments at todays meeting were brief we anticipate a lengthy order addressing the numerous issues raised by parties in their requests for rehearing

Clients FROM John Hengerer RE Commission Meeting February At todays meeting the Commissioners approved the consent agenda and discussed the following items HYDRO AGENDA Public Utility District No of Okanogan County Washington Docket No P This draft order rescinded the hydro license issued to Public Utility District No of Okanogan County Washington Utility District after the National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS conditioned the license on construction of a fish ladder that would have rendered the proposed project uneconomic Commissioner Hebert moved the item to the discussion agenda to highlight the difficulties incurred in hydro licensing proceedings due to the conditioning authority granted to certain federal agencies such as NMFS Because such agencies possess the authority to impose costly environmental conditions Commission Hebert stated they essentially hold veto power over project applications Commissioner Hebert urged federal agencies to weigh potential public benefits before imposing costly environmental conditions that doom proposed projects Avista Corporation Docket No P In this draft order the Commission granted a hydro license to Avista Corporation Chairman Hoecker moved the item to the discussion agenda to champion the use of alternate licensing procedures and applaud the parties for negotiating the settlement approved by the draft order Avista began negotiating for the license in and eventually reached a settlement with stakeholders According to Chairman Hebert such negotiations maximize benefits reduce application costs and set a positive example for other parties to follow Although the other Commissioners generally echoed Chairman Hoeckers praise Commissioner Hebert criticized the draft order for not quantifying the environmental benefits of Avistas proposed project ELECTRIC MATTERS New England Power Pool ISO New England Docket Nos ER et al Price caps on the ISOs Operating Reserve and Operable Capability markets were extended by the Commission in this draft order Commissioner Hebert dissenting Both caps expired on December The cap on the Operating Reserve Market was extended until June or until the ISO submits a market redesign plan to correct market flaws The cap on the Operable Capability Market was extended until February after which the market will be terminated According to the ISOs filing which was approved in this draft order the Operable Capability Market duplicates other ISO markets and is no longer needed Commissioner Hebert dissented and moved the item to the discussion agenda to express his disapproval of price caps both in general and in this particular proceeding In general Commissioner Hebert believes that price caps remove the natural incentives created by a competitive market In this particular proceeding Commission Hebert argues that supposedly temporary price caps have become a Acrutch relied on by the ISO Moreover Commissioner Hebert does not believe that the ISO market is flawed and contends that the ISO has failed to illustrate the existence of any flaws For these reasons Commissioner Hebert would not have extended the price caps Regional Transmission Organizations Order on Rehearing Docket No RM In this draft rehearing order while making relatively minor clarifications and revisions the Commission unanimously affirmed the policy decisions outlined in Order No FERC Issued in December Order No outlined the Commissions policy with regard to RTO formation and adopted regulations governing the filing and review of RTO proposals This draft order affirmed the voluntary and flexible approach adopted by Order No as well as the RTO functions and characteristics outlined in that order However the draft order does include a number of relatively minor revisions and clarifications Specifically the draft order i denies requests to phase out passive ownership of RTO facilities by transmission owners but clarifies that passive owners must not interfere with daytoday RTO operations ii clarifies Section tariff filing rights by reiterating that RTOs should have control of their own tariffs while transmission owners should determine their own return on equity iii incorporates Order No s audit requirements into Commission regulations while ruling that the both an RTOs ownership and governance structures are subject to audit and iv clarifies that public utility compliance filings must specify what efforts were made to include RTO participation by public cooperatives In approving the draft rehearing order only two months after the issuance of Order No the Commission hopes that the ongoing collaborative process will be able to focus on the basic elements of RTO formation rather than on the contentious issues raised in the rehearing requests Order No s collaborative process began this month and is scheduled to run through April Public Utilities not currently participating in a regional transmission entity are required to make a compliance filing by October while those utilities that are already a part of a regional entity must make a compliance filing by January Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator et al Docket Nos ER et al In this draft order the Commission unanimously Commissioner Massey concurring voiced its support for the binary RTO model proposed in this proceeding but declined to issue the requested declaratory order until a final proposal is filed The binary model proposed by Midwest ISO participants would require the ISO to delegate certain functions to a forprofit transco while retaining other functions and maintaining responsibility for overseeing the transcos activities The draft order commends parties for developing the proposal and finds that the proposed binary model generally conforms to the Commissions RTO mandate However the Commission declined to make a final determination until a complete proposal is submitted Commissioner Masseys concurrence raises concerns associated with the sharing of power between an ISO and a transco Commissioner Massey believes that such a division of power may be counterproductive and urges the parties to address the issue in their final filing PIPELINE MATTERS ANR Pipeline Company Docket No CP ANRs proposal to increase mainline capacity from Joliet Illinois into Wisconsin was approved in this draft order Specifically the draft order permits ANR to construct an additional horsepower of mainline capacity thereby increasing mainline capacity into Wisconsin by Dthday by November The Commission approved ANRs proposal after concluding that demand in Wisconsin justifies the expansion The expansion approved in this draft order is part of ANRs SupplyLink proposal to be built in conjunction with the IndependenceMarketLink project ANR decided to proceed with the JoliettoWisconsin expansion after the SupplyLinkIndependenceMarketLink project was delayed due to Commission concerns that the project was not adequately supported by market demand Although the expansion approved in this draft order was unrelated to the contentious portions of the larger project Commissioner Hebert nonetheless moved the item to the discussion agenda to express his belief that market demand justifies the IndependenceMarketLink project Specifically Commissioner Hebert cited recent spikes in heating oil prices as evidence that gas demand in the northeastern United States more than justifies the project Commissioner Breathitt disagreed with Commission Hebert and argued that the price of heating oil does not necessarily correlate to natural gas demand

of available shortterm power withhold sale of shortterm power refuse to transmit third party shortterm power and require purchases from AEP at the emergency rate millkwh when an emergency might not exist Ex AMPO at In December AMPOhio negotiated a MW purchase of shortterm power from Louisville Gas Electric Company LGE AEP refused to wheel because LGE had earlier that day told AEP it had no power to sell to AEP AEP then bought the power from LGE and offered to resell it to AMPOhio Ex AMPO at In January AMPOhio solicited bids for February power purchases from a number of utilities including AEP AEP was not the winning bid AMPOhio made arrangements to purchase the power from four winning bidders and sought transmission through AEP When AMPOhio gave AEP After the Rehearing Order expanding the scope of the proceeding AMPOhio and IMPA withdrew this testimony as no longer necessary This withdrawal does not change the fact that the testimony was sworn to under oath F the schedule for delivery AEP refused to transmit the power matched the average price of the winning bids and made the sale itself Ex AMPO at In August an AMPOhio member Columbus Ohio was purchasing MW of hourly nondisplacement power from AEP and after AEP raised its price to millskwh sought another source for the next hour Consumers Power Company and Detroit Edison Company both offered nondisplacement power at mills AEP refused to transmit saying it had a MW unit out and could not resell power from another source Columbus cancelled the transaction and had to buy MW of power from AEP at millskwh Ex AMPO at In July two AMPOhio members Columbus and St Marys had been buying hourly nondisplacement power from AEP when the price rose to mills Dayton Power Light Company DPL offered to sell at mills and AEP agreed to transmit for one hour But for the next hour AEP said it had problems with its system refused to transmit the power kept the power from DPL for itself and offered to sell power to AMPOhio for Columbus and St Marys at AEP generally limited its offer of shortterm transmission to buysell transactions that is AEP would buy the power from the seller and resell it to the purchaser Supplemental testimony of AEP Witness Baker Ex A at Often the terms of the buysell transaction required transmission dependent utilities TDUs to maintain reserves and meet contractual commitments for at least a year Id F mills Columbus increased its local generation but St Marys purchased MW at mills For the next hour AMP Ohio arranged with DPL for another MW hoping AEP would transmit under the hour buysell agreement AEP did transmit this power Seven hours later in the day St Marys Greenup Hydro project power was available and the MW from DPL was no longer needed If St Marys had been receiving the hourly power that AEP had refused to transmit St Marys could have switched to Greenup power But because AMPOhio had changed to daily service St Marys had to pay a demand charge for the entire day even though it used the power only hours and would have paid less under the hourly rate Ex AMPO at In January AMPOhio sought to transfer power from one member with generation to other members which required transmission over AEP and Toledo Edison lines Toledo Edison said yes AEP said no AMPOhios northern members purchased emergency power from Toledo Edison AMP Ohio then reminded AEP that it had agreed not to deny transmission and AEP agreed to transmit Ex AMPO at IMPA arranged to buy MW of shortterm power from LGE and have it wheeled using buysell arrangements through Public Service Company of Indiana PSI and AEP to serve IMPAs load at Richmond an IMPA member The delivered price was per kWday plus a mill adder At the same time AEP arranged to buy MW from PSI at F per kW day plus outofpocket energy costs Hence PSI was shipping a total of MW to AEP with MW of that amount to be delivered to IMPAs load at Richmond Then on a day when IMPA should have received the MW AEP told IMPA that PSI had sold everything to AEP and that IMPA would have to buy from AEP at per kW day plus the cost of energy from AEP IMPA purchased from AEP under protest AEP used its control over transmission to intercept the MW at a lower price and resell it as shortterm power to IMPA AEP claimed that PSI had terminated its sales to AEP on that day But the MW was independent of PSIs other sales to AEP and would not have been interrupted if AEP had not interrupted it IMPA at IMPA has combustion turbines owned by and located at one member which IMPA would like to connect to the Joint Transmission System owned by IMPA CINergy and Wabash Valley Power Association To do so IMPA needed a metering agreement with AEP to which AEP would not agree IMPA at In January IMPA had power to sell from its turbines when AEP and others needed power IMPA offered power to AEP but AEP it said could not purchase the power without an existing contract Moreover since there was no shortterm tariff IMPA could not sell the power to another utility IMPA at Another example of the utility engaging in F dilatory tactics that raised the customers transaction costs and effectively denied transmission is the sham transaction provision proposed by AEP As filed AEPs tariffs permitted it to deny service merely because a portion of the transmitted power might be used to serve a former retail customer of AEP See eg Ex BRWVP J Bertram Solomon testimony February As part of a settlement AEP filed the pro forma tariff and withdrew this provision Finally AEPs originally filed tariff contained a prodigal customer provision Under this provision transmission customers who sought to convert back to requirements service had to give AEP five years notice in which case AEP and the customer would enter into negotiations to determine whether AEP will provide service at all and if so under what rate terms and conditions Ex S at Staff testimony AEP did not require notice from all new customers only from prodigal customers Id at That a potential customer was previously served by AEP is not a reason to treat the customer differently AEP withdrew this provision when it filed the pro forma tariff B Entergy Services Inc Entergy Entergy filed a partial settlement largely adopting the NOPR pro forma tariffs except for two provisions headroom and ancillary services Because the settlement predated the filing date for customer testimony before the ALJ the customers did not F address the need for Entergy to file a tariff However customers did make allegations of discriminatory practices as follows Customers alleged that Entergy flatout refused to wheel Louisiana Energy and Power Authority LEPA witness Sylvan J Richard testified that LEPAs predecessor systems could not obtain interconnections from Entergy Ex SJR at Customers also alleged that Entergy refused to provide service priority equal to native load and refused to provide service flexibility equivalent to the utilitys own use For example LEPA witness Richard testified that even after state commissions ordered interconnections and other coordination services LEPAs predecessors were still not able to obtain coordination services because Entergy was not willing to coordinate and because the transmission service it did offer was inflexible unidirectional pointtopoint service which prevented economic coordination with others Id at South Mississippi Electric Power Association SMEPA witness J Bertram Solomon testified that Entergys original open access tariff was restricted to pointto point service proposed separate charges for each operating company and required the cancellation of existing agreements in order to take service under the proposed tariff Ex SMEPA at Entergy eventually filed a F network tariff but proposed different local facilities charges for the various Entergy public utility operating subsidiaries Id at Since these local facilities charges were higher than the transmission component of the subsidiaries bundled rates Entergy obtained a competitive advantage Id The Arkansas Cities and Cooperatives ACC is a group of cities and cooperatives that own or operate electric generation or distribution systems in Arkansas ACC Witness Steven Merchant testified that Entergy has segregated the wholesale market between two of its subsidiaries Arkansas Power Light Copmpany APL and Entergy Power Inc EPI Ex SMM at In marketing power and energy in Arkansas EPI is subject to an Arkansas Commission order that bars EPI from competing with APL for wholesale loads without first obtaining a waiver Id Recently EPI requested this waiver for all wholesale transactions in Arkansas except for wholesale customers currently served by an Entergy subsidiary in other words EPI requested the Arkansas Commission to expand competition for all wholesale customers except where EPI might compete with APL Id ACC witness Merchant concluded that since EPI does not compete with APL Entergy insulates APLs wholesale business from competition and denies those wholesale customers access to EPI as a source of power thereby limiting alternative generation sources available to F ACC Id at Entergys witness Kenney stated that Entergy has recently filed a joint motion with ACC to the Arkansas Commission seeking to extend the waiver and permit EPI to sell to APLs wholesale customers Ex JFK at C Pacific Gas Electric Company PGE Northern California Power Agency NCPA attached several documents to its complaint in Docket No EL These documents were provided to support NCPAs claim that PGEs unreasonable practices under the PGENCPA Interconnection Agreement IA effectively denied NCPA access to transmission properly requested under the IA Although the parties eventually settled and the Commission terminated the docket with a letter order dated May these documents provide allegations of PGE using dilatory tactics that so protracted negotiations as to effectively equal a refusal to wheel PGE stated that since transmission was not currently available it was entitled to wait months before providing transmission that is transmission access could not be granted before the passing of the month notice period NCPA Complaint Ex However the IA All of these incidents are related to and examples of PGEs conduct described in the NOPR FERC Stats Regs F at n that is the history of PGEs attempt to avoid its commitments made to the California owners of the California Oregon Transmission Project COTP However these incidents are not exactly the same as the incidents described in the NOPR because NCPA is not one of the owners of the COTP F provided that transmission be provided when it becomes actually available PGE also requested substantial additional information which NCPA considered beyond that reasonably necessary for a study but still provided PGE then determined that transmission was not available reasoning that transmission was unavailable unless all the transmission requested could be provided hours per year without restrictions or limitations extending through the expiration of the agreement in NCPA Complaint at On November NCPA made a new transmission request to PGE seeking MW of bidirectional transmission at Midway NCPA Complaint Ex On January PGE filed an interconnection agreement with Turlock Irrigation District TID that provided TID with MW of bidirectional transmission at Midway Pacific Gas Electric Company FERC F order o n rehg FERC F On February PG E advised NCPA that all firm transmission service available at Midway had been fully subscribed NCPA Complaint Ex Then on March PGE filed with the Commission an interconnection agreement with Modesto Irrigation District MID that provided MID with MW of bi directional transmission at Midway Pacific Gas Electric Company FERC F At about the same time in the last week in March PGE advised NCPA that the F allocations of transmission to TID MID and others including a not yet finalized allocation to Sacramento Municipality Utility District had used all the transmission available at Midway NCPA Complaint Exs and D Northeast Utilities Service Company NU This is the case where Northeast Utilities acquired Public Service of New Hampshire PSNH Docket No EC New England Power Company NEP witness Robert Bigelows direct testimony expressed concern over the relatively restrictive transmission policies of both NU on behalf of Northeast Utilities public utility subsidiaries and PSNH Bigelow Direct Testimony at filed May In his cross rebuttal testimony Mr Bigelow testified that NU has a poor track record as a provider of transmission service and PSNH also has an abhorrent track record as a provider of transmission services Bigelow Cross Rebuttal Testimony at filed June Mr Bigelow described both NUs and NEPs his own company failure to provide service flexibility equivalent to their own use Except for NEPs TDUs both NEP and NU historically provided only pointtopoint transmission which required separate scheduling for each transaction Bigelow Cross Rebuttal at E Southern California Edison Company and San Diego Gas and Electric Company The evidence in this merger proceeding Docket No EC included testimony from a number of witnesses describing F instances of Edisons conduct Richard Greenwalt was the power supply supervisor for the City of Riverside California He was responsible for scheduling all purchases of energy for Riverside and for the cities of Azusa Banning and Colton California Greenwalt testimony at November These four cities and Anaheim California are collectively referred to as the Southern Cities or Cities Joseph Hsu was the Director of Utilities for Azusa Hsu testimony at November Gale Drews was the electric utility director of Colton Drews testimony at November Bill Carnahan was the director for Riverside Carnahan testimony at November Gordon Hoyt was the general manager of the Anaheim power department Hoyt testimony at November Dan McCann was the power coordination supervisor for Anaheim He supervised Anaheims load scheduling and is a former Edison employee having worked for Edison for years McCann Testimony at November These witnesses testified that Edison refused to wheel as follows Edisons policy was to curtail the Cities any time it could be justified using any of a list of acceptable reasons to deny interruptible transmission service Id at Edison would not generally provide transmission service when Edison could save money by itself purchasing the economy energy that would be wheeled McCann testimony at The Cities called Edison every hour to request interruptible transmission service Id Edison often F refused to sell energy available in the Western Systems Power Pool to the Cities and then made available higher cost contract energy or partial requirements service Id at When Anaheim requested Edison provide firm transmission of power from neighboring states Edison would often agree to provide nonfirm service but would not integrate the capacity for many years in the future saying that its control area did not need capacity at that time Hoyt testimony at Since the selling utility was interested in a sale of capacity not just energy the transaction would not occur Id Edison repeatedly used its control over transmission to deny Anaheim access to low cost firm power Id at While Edison provided shortterm firm transmission service to the Cities it would only provide longterm firm service for three specific resources the SONGS nuclear plant a specific IPP and Hoover Dam power Hoyt testimony at One of Edisons reasons for denying longterm transmission was that Edison desired to reserve the transmission for its own future unspecified needs Id In the s Edison refused to allow the Cities access to the Pacific Intertie Hoyt testimony at Drews testimony at In Edison refused to provide transmission service for a Cities power purchase from Public Service F Company of New Mexico PSNM from Palo Verde Nuclear station Hoyt testimony at Edison has refused to provide requested firm transmission from CaliforniaOregon border to Midway Station NevadaOregon Border to Sylmar Substation Palo Verde Switchyard to Vista SONGS Switchyard to Vista Carnahan testimony at Riverside requested transmission from Palo Verde and was told that such service was not available Carnahan testimony at Edison offered Riverside only MW of curtailable transmission entitlement to provide Riversides share of Palo Verde Id This service was neither large enough or long enough and Edison insisted on unreasonable terms and conditions Id Azusa Banning and Colton had a contract with Edison that entitled them to use their Palo Verde firm transmission path to schedule energy to meet their contract energy obligation Edison refused to permit the three cities to use that path Edison did not contest that the contracts allowed this use but said that the scheduling of such small amounts of energy for the three cities would be too burdensome Greenwalt testimony at Edison would not respond in a timely manner to the Cities requests routinely taking months to respond Drews F testimony at During the s Edison provided Colton with some transmission service to allow the Cities to reach certain suppliers but limited the choices available to the Cities and imposed terms and conditions that increased the Cities costs and placed Colton at a disadvantage against Edison Drews testimony at Arranging alternative generation sources was difficult because the Cities always had to first get Edison to state whether it would provide transmission During and a dispute arose between Edison and the Cities concerning the Hoover Uprating Project Drews testimony at Edison argued that for the months when units were out of service for uprating and Southern Cities capacity was reduced to zero Southern Cities would not receive an energy credit even though energy was still available and used by Edison But the contracts allowed a participant who did not have capacity to still schedule its energy as nonfirm energy on the capacity of another participant Id at In Azusa negotiated a power purchase contract with the California Department of Water Resources in increments of first MW and then MW for a total of MW Hsu testimony at First Edison assured Azusa that the transmission for the additional MW would not be a problem Id Then Edison would not agree to amend the transmission service agreement for the additional MW Id F In Azusa notified Edison of Special Condition purchases from PGE and requested firm transmission service Id Two months before service was to begin Edison notified the Cities of a problem with the transmission lines Id Transmission was eventually granted but only after a fourmonth delay and substantial losses to the Cities Id Then Edison decided there was no problem with its transmission facilities Id at In the Cities purchased MW from PGE and MW from Deseret GT Cooperative Hoyt testimony at Edison stated that without reinforcement of its transmission system Edison would not provide the transmission Id There was a fivemonth delay during which the Cities were forced to purchase from Edison at a higher cost Id at Then Edison decided that the transmission system did not need reinforcement Id at Edison also refused to provide a service priority equal to that of native load It would curtail the Cities in order to purchase more economy energy for itself McCann testimony at If Edison could make the purchase it would curtail the City and use the energy for itself Id When Edison curtailed the Cities they were not able to Special Condition of the Integrated Operations Agreement between Edison and the Southern Cities defined certain Special Condition resources and allowed the Cities to make certain uses of those resources subject to certain restrictions F purchase economy energy and instead purchased energy from Edison Id at According to Edison the interruptible transmission it provided the Cities was interruptible for any reason Id at A purchase could be terminated the hour after it is begun or even during the hour Id As a result the Cities lost opportunities to make advantageous economy purchases Id at Edison also refused to provide customers flexibility similar to the flexibility Edison provided itself Edisons refusal to provide bidirectional transmission service restricted the Cities abilities to purchase hydroelectric energy from the Pacific Northwest Hoyt testimony at Because most contracts with Northwest utilities require a return of power the Northwest utilities would not deal with the Cities without transmission to return energy Id at Edison did provide bi directional transmission to the Los Angeles Department of Water Power LADWP to accommodate flows to and from Arizona Id Riverside was unable to obtain nonfirm service more than two hours in advance of need Carnahan testimony at Riverside and Colton were both served out of Edisons Vista substation Although the two cities were on the same kV bus Edison would not allow them to sell F energy to each other Greenwalt testimony at Riversides agreement with Edison allowed Riverside to purchase a block of energy through the WSPP and divide it up among the four Cities Azusa Banning Colton and Riverside Greenwalt testimony at When Riverside had excess energy from other sources Edison would not permit it to sell that energy to the other three cities Id For example Riverside attempted to sell Deseret energy transmitted by LADWP to the Edison system Id at LADWP would not break out the Cities shares of that energy and Edison would not accept the energy as a delivery for all four cities Id at Edison argued that because this energy was excess energy that Riverside could not use Riverside did not have transmission rights to bring it into the control area Id As a result Riverside paid for the energy delivered by LADWP to the Edison control area but could not sell it to the other three cities and gave it to Edison itself which consumed the energy without making any payment for it Id Riverside tried a number of alternative paths including using WSPP transmission where Riverside paid Edison mills to connect to Azusa mills to connect to Banning and mills to connect to Colton for each megawatthour While this approach was successful for a while eventually Edison refused to permit these sales Edison claimed that the Cities only have transmission rights to bring in enough Special Condition F energy to satisfy the Cities load Greenwalt testimony at Edison contended that the Cities load requirements were satisfied first by integrated resources and then by Special Condition and economy energy purchases Id at When the Cities integrated resources exceeded their load any Special Condition resources became excess Under Riversides Deseret contract the Cities were required to take a minimum of MW each hour Id Edison acknowledged that it was obligated to buy or allow the Cities to sell any excess energy from Riversides integrated resources Id However Edison refused to give the Cities credit for excess Special Condition energy brought into the area claiming that the Cities could not have brought it in because they did not have transmission rights Id II Other Examples of Transmission Disputes Disputes over transmission are not uncommon contrary to EEIs suggestion Some recent examples taken from pleadings and other documents and from Commission orders reveal that it has been very difficult for various entities in the electric power industry to agree on transmission rights These examples also reveal that even after issuance of AEP and the Open Access NOPR with its proposed pro forma tariffs there has been considerable controversy over whether various utilities open access tariffs deviate from those tariffs The Commission has allowed F utilities that adopt tariffs that match or exceed the nonrate terms and conditions in the NOPR pro forma tariffs to obtain certain benefits A In a letter of February to Mr Gerald Richman of the Commissions Enforcement section in the Office of the General Counsel Steven J Kean Vice President Regulatory Affairs Enron Power Marketing Inc Enron alleged that Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation NiMo refused to wheel power from Rochester Gas Electric RGE to Enron under RGEs transmission contract with NiMo however when Enron revealed the buyer NiMo did wheel power for RGE to the buyer Mr Kean alleged that this was not an isolated incident NiMo argued that the contract did not require it to provide RGE with transmission to Enron It also said that the principle of comparability does not require the service Letter of November from NiMo representative A Karen Hill to Gerald Richman B The Commissions Task Force Hot Line Hot Line received a complaint that a member of the New York Power Pool NYPP refused to transmit power that another member bought from a power marketer In a letter of November from Chair Moler to Mr William J Balet Executive Director of NYPP Chair Moler explained that the Commissions enforcement staff had investigated and found the allegation to be true F C In Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency v Northern States Power Company Minnesota FERC F NSP and SMMPA had a contract under which NSP agreed to provide transmission service However the parties had numerous disputes over the service The Commission found that NSP had misinterpreted the contract in several ways For example SMMPA argued that it should be able to directly schedule its deliveries of energy out of the NSP control area and that it should not be limited to particular points of delivery NSP argued that only it was entitled to control the physical operation of scheduling The Commission found that the clear language of the contracts gave SMMPA the authority to schedule its own power D MidContinent Area Power Pool FERC F involved MAPPs membership criteria which made it impossible for a power marketer to join MAPP and obtain the benefits of certain transmission services available only to MAPP members The Commission found that the membership criteria may be unreasonable particularly since there may be less burdensome ways of setting up membership criteria for nontraditional entities F

Clients FROM John Hengerer RE Commission Meeting February At todays meeting the Commissioners approved the consent agenda and discussed the following items HYDRO AGENDA Public Utility District No of Okanogan County Washington Docket No P This draft order rescinded the hydro license issued to Public Utility District No of Okanogan County Washington Utility District after the National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS conditioned the license on construction of a fish ladder that would have rendered the proposed project uneconomic Commissioner Hebert moved the item to the discussion agenda to highlight the difficulties incurred in hydro licensing proceedings due to the conditioning authority granted to certain federal agencies such as NMFS Because such agencies possess the authority to impose costly environmental conditions Commission Hebert stated they essentially hold veto power over project applications Commissioner Hebert urged federal agencies to weigh potential public benefits before imposing costly environmental conditions that doom proposed projects Avista Corporation Docket No P In this draft order the Commission granted a hydro license to Avista Corporation Chairman Hoecker moved the item to the discussion agenda to champion the use of alternate licensing procedures and applaud the parties for negotiating the settlement approved by the draft order Avista began negotiating for the license in and eventually reached a settlement with stakeholders According to Chairman Hebert such negotiations maximize benefits reduce application costs and set a positive example for other parties to follow Although the other Commissioners generally echoed Chairman Hoeckers praise Commissioner Hebert criticized the draft order for not quantifying the environmental benefits of Avistas proposed project ELECTRIC MATTERS New England Power Pool ISO New England Docket Nos ER et al Price caps on the ISOs Operating Reserve and Operable Capability markets were extended by the Commission in this draft order Commissioner Hebert dissenting Both caps expired on December The cap on the Operating Reserve Market was extended until June or until the ISO submits a market redesign plan to correct market flaws The cap on the Operable Capability Market was extended until February after which the market will be terminated According to the ISOs filing which was approved in this draft order the Operable Capability Market duplicates other ISO markets and is no longer needed Commissioner Hebert dissented and moved the item to the discussion agenda to express his disapproval of price caps both in general and in this particular proceeding In general Commissioner Hebert believes that price caps remove the natural incentives created by a competitive market In this particular proceeding Commission Hebert argues that supposedly temporary price caps have become a Acrutch relied on by the ISO Moreover Commissioner Hebert does not believe that the ISO market is flawed and contends that the ISO has failed to illustrate the existence of any flaws For these reasons Commissioner Hebert would not have extended the price caps Regional Transmission Organizations Order on Rehearing Docket No RM In this draft rehearing order while making relatively minor clarifications and revisions the Commission unanimously affirmed the policy decisions outlined in Order No FERC Issued in December Order No outlined the Commissions policy with regard to RTO formation and adopted regulations governing the filing and review of RTO proposals This draft order affirmed the voluntary and flexible approach adopted by Order No as well as the RTO functions and characteristics outlined in that order However the draft order does include a number of relatively minor revisions and clarifications Specifically the draft order i denies requests to phase out passive ownership of RTO facilities by transmission owners but clarifies that passive owners must not interfere with daytoday RTO operations ii clarifies Section tariff filing rights by reiterating that RTOs should have control of their own tariffs while transmission owners should determine their own return on equity iii incorporates Order No s audit requirements into Commission regulations while ruling that the both an RTOs ownership and governance structures are subject to audit and iv clarifies that public utility compliance filings must specify what efforts were made to include RTO participation by public cooperatives In approving the draft rehearing order only two months after the issuance of Order No the Commission hopes that the ongoing collaborative process will be able to focus on the basic elements of RTO formation rather than on the contentious issues raised in the rehearing requests Order No s collaborative process began this month and is scheduled to run through April Public Utilities not currently participating in a regional transmission entity are required to make a compliance filing by October while those utilities that are already a part of a regional entity must make a compliance filing by January Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator et al Docket Nos ER et al In this draft order the Commission unanimously Commissioner Massey concurring voiced its support for the binary RTO model proposed in this proceeding but declined to issue the requested declaratory order until a final proposal is filed The binary model proposed by Midwest ISO participants would require the ISO to delegate certain functions to a forprofit transco while retaining other functions and maintaining responsibility for overseeing the transcos activities The draft order commends parties for developing the proposal and finds that the proposed binary model generally conforms to the Commissions RTO mandate However the Commission declined to make a final determination until a complete proposal is submitted Commissioner Masseys concurrence raises concerns associated with the sharing of power between an ISO and a transco Commissioner Massey believes that such a division of power may be counterproductive and urges the parties to address the issue in their final filing PIPELINE MATTERS ANR Pipeline Company Docket No CP ANRs proposal to increase mainline capacity from Joliet Illinois into Wisconsin was approved in this draft order Specifically the draft order permits ANR to construct an additional horsepower of mainline capacity thereby increasing mainline capacity into Wisconsin by Dthday by November The Commission approved ANRs proposal after concluding that demand in Wisconsin justifies the expansion The expansion approved in this draft order is part of ANRs SupplyLink proposal to be built in conjunction with the IndependenceMarketLink project ANR decided to proceed with the JoliettoWisconsin expansion after the SupplyLinkIndependenceMarketLink project was delayed due to Commission concerns that the project was not adequately supported by market demand Although the expansion approved in this draft order was unrelated to the contentious portions of the larger project Commissioner Hebert nonetheless moved the item to the discussion agenda to express his belief that market demand justifies the IndependenceMarketLink project Specifically Commissioner Hebert cited recent spikes in heating oil prices as evidence that gas demand in the northeastern United States more than justifies the project Commissioner Breathitt disagreed with Commission Hebert and argued that the price of heating oil does not necessarily correlate to natural gas demand

May At todays meeting the Commissioners approved the consent agenda and then discussed the following items ELECTRIC MATTERS Alliance Companies et al Docket Nos ER In December the Commission issued an order conditionally authorizing the formation of the Alliance RTO At todays meeting the Commissioners denied by a margin of to Commissioner Hebert dissenting rehearing of the December order The Commissioners also unanimously rejected Commissioner Massey concurring Alliances compliance filing In its original filing Alliance proposed allowing each of its active owners to retain up to a percent ownership interest in the RTO up to percent total ownership by active owners The December order rejected this proposal as contrary to the independence principle outlined in Order No which states that active ownership should be limited to a total of percent unless special circumstances are shown Rejecting requests for rehearing the majority concluded that Alliance had failed to justify active member ownership in excess of percent Dissenting Commissioner Hebert argued that i the percent benchmark is arbitrary and should not be viewed as creating a binding legal requirement and ii limiting active ownership will provide a disincentive for other utilities to join the RTO The Commissioners also rejected Alliances compliance filing submitted to satisfy the terms of the December order In addition to failing to correct the active ownership issue outlined above the Commissioners faulted Alliance for not eliminating pancaked rates and for not addressing issues associated with the RTOs scope and configuration Commissioner Massey indicated that he would write a concurrence to stress that Aseams agreements do not negate the need to review the RTOs scope and configuration to ensure that it is properly designed and sized Southwest Power Pool Docket No EL The Commissioners unanimously rejected as failing to meet the requirements of Order No the Southwest Power Pools SPP RTO proposal Commissioner Massey who moved the item to the discussion agenda cited the following shortcomings in SPPs proposal i operational control of transmission facilities was not turned over to the RTO ii the RTOs proposed openaccess transmission tariff did not comply with Order No iii no realtime balancing market had been proposed iv lingering concerns with the RTOs governance structure and v the RTOs proposed scope and configuration are inadequate Commissioner Massey encouraged the SPP to join other entities seeking to form an RTO or consider merging with the Midwest ISO Notice of Interim Procedures to Support Reliability and Request for Comments Docket No EL The Commissioners unanimously approved shortterm procedures designed to address Summer reliability concerns The approved measures provide for i streamlining FERC procedures to promote onsite distributed generation ii waiving priornotice requirements for loadreduction agreements iii improving demandside price signals iv requiring more extensive OASIS posting of available transmission capacity and v making Commission Staff more available to the industry to address reliability concerns Comments on the proposed shortterm measures are due by June Additionally agreeing that the shortterm procedures are very minimal in nature the Commissioners requested comments on longterm reliability issues Comments are due by June Finally Commissioner Hebert indicated that he would write a separate concurrence to express his belief that competitive forces are the answer to reliability concerns and to criticize the Commission for not eliminating artificial price caps and promoting competitive rates Commissioner Heberts accusation that the Commission was more concerned with politics than good policy touched off a heated debate with Chairman Hoecker reciting FERC successes and Commissioner Massey scoffing at Commissioner Heberts suggestion that price caps were to blame for generation shortages GAS MATTERS Regulation of ShortTerm Natural Gas Transportation Services Regulation of Interstate Natural Gas Transportation Services Docket Nos RM RM The Commissioners unanimously addressed and generally denied requests for rehearing of Order No Finding that Order No strikes a good balance between competing interests the Commissioners indicated that their order would with several exceptions uphold the mandates of the order The Commissioners expressly noted that requests for rehearing of rightoffirstrefusal ROFR rollup issues would be denied Order No states that if a pipeline is fully subscribed a party wishing to exercise a ROFR will be required to match competing bids even if a competing bid exceeds the maximum rate for the capacity Revisions and clarifications of Order No approved by the Commissioners at todays meeting include shippers with multiyear contracts at max rates for seasonal service will retain their ROFR pipelines will be required to post available capacity within one hour of each nomination cycle rather than within one day as directed by Order shortterm capacity release transactions must be posted within one hour of the first nomination under the contract rather than upon the execution of the contract as stated in Order No and Order No s OFO penalty and imbalance provisions will be clarified in the Commission order Although comments at todays meeting were brief we

Transmission Dominance APPENDIX C Allegations of Public Utilities Exercising Transmission Dominance I Examples From Proceedings Before Administrative Law Judges These are examples of allegations that various public utilities have refused to provide comparable service either through refusals to wheel dilatory tactics that so protracted negotiations as to effectively deny wheeling refusals to provide service priority equal to native load or refusals to provide service flexibility equivalent to the utilitys own use A American Electric Power Service Corp AEP In AEP filed on behalf of its public utility associate companies an open access tariff that offered only firm pointtopoint service with very limited flexibility It did not offer network service flexible pointtopoint service or non firm service Thus it did not provide customers with the same flexibility that AEP itself has Nor did it provide a service priority equivalent to that enjoyed by native load The Commission set AEPs tariff for hearing and on rehearing held that in order not to be unduly discriminatory the tariff had to offer comparable service American Electric Power Service Corp FERC F rehg FERC F At hearing Raj Rao of Indiana Michigan Power Agency IMPA Ex IMPA Feb and Kenneth Hegemann of American Municipal PowerOhio Inc AMPOhio Ex AMPO Feb both senior management officials testified concerning AEPs F alleged discriminatory practices AMPOhio is an association of municipalities in Ohio some of whose members depend on AEP for transmission and partial requirements service IMPA is an association of municipalities in Indiana and many of IMPAs loads are captive to the AEP transmission system The witnesses alleged as follows In anticipation of high peak demands AEP would contract for large blocks of available shortterm power withhold sale of shortterm power refuse to transmit third party shortterm power and require purchases from AEP at the emergency rate millkwh when an emergency might not exist Ex AMPO at In December AMPOhio negotiated a MW purchase of shortterm power from Louisville Gas Electric Company LGE AEP refused to wheel because LGE had earlier that day told AEP it had no power to sell to AEP AEP then bought the power from LGE and offered to resell it to AMPOhio Ex AMPO at In January AMPOhio solicited bids for February power purchases from a number of utilities including AEP AEP was not the winning bid AMPOhio made arrangements to purchase the power from four winning bidders and sought transmission through AEP When AMPOhio gave AEP After the Rehearing Order expanding the scope of the proceeding AMPOhio and IMPA withdrew this testimony as no longer necessary This withdrawal does not change the fact that the testimony was sworn to under oath F the schedule for delivery AEP refused to transmit the power matched the average price of the winning bids and made the sale itself Ex AMPO at In August an AMPOhio member Columbus Ohio was purchasing MW of hourly nondisplacement power from AEP and after AEP raised its price to millskwh sought another source for the next hour Consumers Power Company and Detroit Edison Company both offered nondisplacement power at mills AEP refused to transmit saying it had a MW unit out and could not resell power from another source Columbus cancelled the transaction and had to buy MW of power from AEP at millskwh Ex AMPO at In July two AMPOhio members Columbus and St Marys had been buying hourly nondisplacement power from AEP when the price rose to mills Dayton Power Light Company DPL offered to sell at mills and AEP agreed to transmit for one hour But for the next hour AEP said it had problems with its system refused to transmit the power kept the power from DPL for itself and offered to sell power to AMPOhio for Columbus and St Marys at AEP generally limited its offer of shortterm transmission to buysell transactions that is AEP would buy the power from the seller and resell it to the purchaser Supplemental testimony of AEP Witness Baker Ex A at Often the terms of the buysell transaction required transmission dependent utilities TDUs to maintain reserves and meet contractual commitments for at least a year Id F mills Columbus increased its local generation but St Marys purchased MW at mills For the next hour AMP Ohio arranged with DPL for another MW hoping AEP would transmit under the hour buysell agreement AEP did transmit this power Seven hours later in the day St Marys Greenup Hydro project power was available and the MW from DPL was no longer needed If St Marys had been receiving the hourly power that AEP had refused to transmit St Marys could have switched to Greenup power But because AMPOhio had changed to daily service St Marys had to pay a demand charge for the entire day even though it used the power only hours and would have paid less under the hourly rate Ex AMPO at In January AMPOhio sought to transfer power from one member with generation to other members which required transmission over AEP and Toledo Edison lines Toledo Edison said yes AEP said no AMPOhios northern members purchased emergency power from Toledo Edison AMP Ohio then reminded AEP that it had agreed not to deny transmission and AEP agreed to transmit Ex AMPO at IMPA arranged to buy MW of shortterm power from LGE and have it wheeled using buysell arrangements through Public Service Company of Indiana PSI and AEP to serve IMPAs load at Richmond an IMPA member The delivered price was per kWday plus a mill adder At the same time AEP arranged to buy MW from PSI at F per kW day plus outofpocket energy costs Hence PSI was shipping a total of MW to AEP with MW of that amount to be delivered to IMPAs load at Richmond Then on a day when IMPA should have received the MW AEP told IMPA that PSI had sold everything to AEP and that IMPA would have to buy from AEP at per kW day plus the cost of energy from AEP IMPA purchased from AEP under protest AEP used its control over transmission to intercept the MW at a lower price and resell it as shortterm power to IMPA AEP claimed that PSI had terminated its sales to AEP on that day But the MW was independent of PSIs other sales to AEP and would not have been interrupted if AEP had not interrupted it IMPA at IMPA has combustion turbines owned by and located at one member which IMPA would like to connect to the Joint Transmission System owned by IMPA CINergy and Wabash Valley Power Association To do so IMPA needed a metering agreement with AEP to which AEP would not agree IMPA at In January IMPA had power to sell from its turbines when AEP and others needed power IMPA offered power to AEP but AEP it said could not purchase the power without an existing contract Moreover since there was no shortterm tariff IMPA could not sell the power to another utility IMPA at Another example of the utility engaging in F dilatory tactics that raised the customers transaction costs and effectively denied transmission is the sham transaction provision proposed by AEP As filed AEPs tariffs permitted it to deny service merely because a portion of the transmitted power might be used to serve a former retail customer of AEP See eg Ex BRWVP J Bertram Solomon testimony February As part of a settlement AEP filed the pro forma tariff and withdrew this provision Finally AEPs originally filed tariff contained a prodigal customer provision Under this provision transmission customers who sought to convert back to requirements service had to give AEP five years notice in which case AEP and the customer would enter into negotiations to determine whether AEP will provide service at all and if so under what rate terms and conditions Ex S at Staff testimony AEP did not require notice from all new customers only from prodigal customers Id at That a potential customer was previously served by AEP is not a reason to treat the customer differently AEP withdrew this provision when it filed the pro forma tariff B Entergy Services Inc Entergy Entergy filed a partial settlement largely adopting the NOPR pro forma tariffs except for two provisions headroom and ancillary services Because the settlement predated the filing date for customer testimony before the ALJ the customers did not F address the need for Entergy to file a tariff However customers did make allegations of discriminatory practices as follows Customers alleged that Entergy flatout refused to wheel Louisiana Energy and Power Authority LEPA witness Sylvan J Richard testified that LEPAs predecessor systems could not obtain interconnections from Entergy Ex SJR at Customers also alleged that Entergy refused to provide service priority equal to native load and refused to provide service flexibility equivalent to the utilitys own use For example LEPA witness Richard testified that even after state commissions ordered interconnections and other coordination services LEPAs predecessors were still not able to obtain coordination services because Entergy was not willing to coordinate and because the transmission service it did offer was inflexible unidirectional pointtopoint service which prevented economic coordination with others Id at South Mississippi Electric Power Association SMEPA witness J Bertram Solomon testified that Entergys original open access tariff was restricted to pointto point service proposed separate charges for each operating company and required the cancellation of existing agreements in order to take service under the proposed tariff Ex SMEPA at Entergy eventually filed a F network tariff but proposed different local facilities charges for the various Entergy public utility operating subsidiaries Id at Since these local facilities charges were higher than the transmission component of the subsidiaries bundled rates Entergy obtained a competitive advantage Id The Arkansas Cities and Cooperatives ACC is a group of cities and cooperatives that own or operate electric generation or distribution systems in Arkansas ACC Witness Steven Merchant testified that Entergy has segregated the wholesale market between two of its subsidiaries Arkansas Power Light Copmpany APL and Entergy Power Inc EPI Ex SMM at In marketing power and energy in Arkansas EPI is subject to an Arkansas Commission order that bars EPI from competing with APL for wholesale loads without first obtaining a waiver Id Recently EPI requested this waiver for all wholesale transactions in Arkansas except for wholesale customers currently served by an Entergy subsidiary in other words EPI requested the Arkansas Commission to expand competition for all wholesale customers except where EPI might compete with APL Id ACC witness Merchant concluded that since EPI does not compete with APL Entergy insulates APLs wholesale business from competition and denies those wholesale customers access to EPI as a source of power thereby limiting alternative generation sources available to F ACC Id at Entergys witness Kenney stated that Entergy has recently filed a joint motion with ACC to the Arkansas Commission seeking to extend the waiver and permit EPI to sell to APLs wholesale customers Ex JFK at C Pacific Gas Electric Company PGE Northern California Power Agency NCPA attached several documents to its complaint in Docket No EL These documents were provided to support NCPAs claim that PGEs unreasonable practices under the PGENCPA Interconnection Agreement IA effectively denied NCPA access to transmission properly requested under the IA Although the parties eventually settled and the Commission terminated the docket with a letter order dated May these documents provide allegations of PGE using dilatory tactics that so protracted negotiations as to effectively equal a refusal to wheel PGE stated that since transmission was not currently available it was entitled to wait months before providing transmission that is transmission access could not be granted before the passing of the month notice period NCPA Complaint Ex However the IA All of these incidents are related to and examples of PGEs conduct described in the NOPR FERC Stats Regs F at n that is the history of PGEs attempt to avoid its commitments made to the California owners of the California Oregon Transmission Project COTP However these incidents are not exactly the same as the incidents described in the NOPR because NCPA is not one of the owners of the COTP F provided that transmission be provided when it becomes actually available PGE also requested substantial additional information which NCPA considered beyond that reasonably necessary for a study but still provided PGE then determined that transmission was not available reasoning that transmission was unavailable unless all the transmission requested could be provided hours per year without restrictions or limitations extending through the expiration of the agreement in NCPA Complaint at On November NCPA made a new transmission request to PGE seeking MW of bidirectional transmission at Midway NCPA Complaint Ex On January PGE filed an interconnection agreement with Turlock Irrigation District TID that provided TID with MW of bidirectional transmission at Midway Pacific Gas Electric Company FERC F order o n rehg FERC F On February PG E advised NCPA that all firm transmission service available at Midway had been fully subscribed NCPA Complaint Ex Then on March PGE filed with the Commission an interconnection agreement with Modesto Irrigation District MID that provided MID with MW of bi directional transmission at Midway Pacific Gas Electric Company FERC F At about the same time in the last week in March PGE advised NCPA that the F allocations of transmission to TID MID and others including a not yet finalized allocation to Sacramento Municipality Utility District had used all the transmission available at Midway NCPA Complaint Exs and D Northeast Utilities Service Company NU This is the case where Northeast Utilities acquired Public Service of New Hampshire PSNH Docket No EC New England Power Company NEP witness Robert Bigelows direct testimony expressed concern over the relatively restrictive transmission policies of both NU on behalf of Northeast Utilities public utility subsidiaries and PSNH Bigelow Direct Testimony at filed May In his cross rebuttal testimony Mr Bigelow testified that NU has a poor track record as a provider of transmission service and PSNH also has an abhorrent track record as a provider of transmission services Bigelow Cross Rebuttal Testimony at filed June Mr Bigelow described both NUs and NEPs his own company failure to provide service flexibility equivalent to their own use Except for NEPs TDUs both NEP and NU historically provided only pointtopoint transmission which required separate scheduling for each transaction Bigelow Cross Rebuttal at E Southern California Edison Company and San Diego Gas and Electric Company The evidence in this merger proceeding Docket No EC included testimony from a number of witnesses describing F instances of Edisons conduct Richard Greenwalt was the power supply supervisor for the City of Riverside California He was responsible for scheduling all purchases of energy for Riverside and for the cities of Azusa Banning and Colton California Greenwalt testimony at November These four cities and Anaheim California are collectively referred to as the Southern Cities or Cities Joseph Hsu was the Director of Utilities for Azusa Hsu testimony at November Gale Drews was the electric utility director of Colton Drews testimony at November Bill Carnahan was the director for Riverside Carnahan testimony at November Gordon Hoyt was the general manager of the Anaheim power department Hoyt testimony at November Dan McCann was the power coordination supervisor for Anaheim He supervised Anaheims load scheduling and is a former Edison employee having worked for Edison for years McCann Testimony at November These witnesses testified that Edison refused to wheel as follows Edisons policy was to curtail the Cities any time it could be justified using any of a list of acceptable reasons to deny interruptible transmission service Id at Edison would not generally provide transmission service when Edison could save money by itself purchasing the economy energy that would be wheeled McCann testimony at The Cities called Edison every hour to request interruptible transmission service Id Edison often F refused to sell energy available in the Western Systems Power Pool to the Cities and then made available higher cost contract energy or partial requirements service Id at When Anaheim requested Edison provide firm transmission of power from neighboring states Edison would often agree to provide nonfirm service but would not integrate the capacity for many years in the future saying that its control area did not need capacity at that time Hoyt testimony at Since the selling utility was interested in a sale of capacity not just energy the transaction would not occur Id Edison repeatedly used its control over transmission to deny Anaheim access to low cost firm power Id at While Edison provided shortterm firm transmission service to the Cities it would only provide longterm firm service for three specific resources the SONGS nuclear plant a specific IPP and Hoover Dam power Hoyt testimony at One of Edisons reasons for denying longterm transmission was that Edison desired to reserve the transmission for its own future unspecified needs Id In the s Edison refused to allow the Cities access to the Pacific Intertie Hoyt testimony at Drews testimony at In Edison refused to provide transmission service for a Cities power purchase from Public Service F Company of New Mexico PSNM from Palo Verde Nuclear station Hoyt testimony at Edison has refused to provide requested firm transmission from CaliforniaOregon border to Midway Station NevadaOregon Border to Sylmar Substation Palo Verde Switchyard to Vista SONGS Switchyard to Vista Carnahan testimony at Riverside requested transmission from Palo Verde and was told that such service was not available Carnahan testimony at Edison offered Riverside only MW of curtailable transmission entitlement to provide Riversides share of Palo Verde Id This service was neither large enough or long enough and Edison insisted on unreasonable terms and conditions Id Azusa Banning and Colton had a contract with Edison that entitled them to use their Palo Verde firm transmission path to schedule energy to meet their contract energy obligation Edison refused to permit the three cities to use that path Edison did not contest that the contracts allowed this use but said that the scheduling of such small amounts of energy for the three cities would be too burdensome Greenwalt testimony at Edison would not respond in a timely manner to the Cities requests routinely taking months to respond Drews F testimony at During the s Edison provided Colton with some transmission service to allow the Cities to reach certain suppliers but limited the choices available to the Cities and imposed terms and conditions that increased the Cities costs and placed Colton at a disadvantage against Edison Drews testimony at Arranging alternative generation sources was difficult because the Cities always had to first get Edison to state whether it would provide transmission During and a dispute arose between Edison and the Cities concerning the Hoover Uprating Project Drews testimony at Edison argued that for the months when units were out of service for uprating and Southern Cities capacity was reduced to zero Southern Cities would not receive an energy credit even though energy was still available and used by Edison But the contracts allowed a participant who did not have capacity to still schedule its energy as nonfirm energy on the capacity of another participant Id at In Azusa negotiated a power purchase contract with the California Department of Water Resources in increments of first MW and then MW for a total of MW Hsu testimony at First Edison assured Azusa that the transmission for the additional MW would not be a problem Id Then Edison would not agree to amend the transmission service agreement for the additional MW Id F In Azusa notified Edison of Special Condition purchases from PGE and requested firm transmission service Id Two months before service was to begin Edison notified the Cities of a problem with the transmission lines Id Transmission was eventually granted but only after a fourmonth delay and substantial losses to the Cities Id Then Edison decided there was no problem with its transmission facilities Id at In the Cities purchased MW from PGE and MW from Deseret GT Cooperative Hoyt testimony at Edison stated that without reinforcement of its transmission system Edison would not provide the transmission Id There was a fivemonth delay during which the Cities were forced to purchase from Edison at a higher cost Id at Then Edison decided that the transmission system did not need reinforcement Id at Edison also refused to provide a service priority equal to that of native load It would curtail the Cities in order to purchase more economy energy for itself McCann testimony at If Edison could make the purchase it would curtail the City and use the energy for itself Id When Edison curtailed the Cities they were not able to Special Condition of the Integrated Operations Agreement between Edison and the Southern Cities defined certain Special Condition resources and allowed the Cities to make certain uses of those resources subject to certain restrictions F purchase economy energy and instead purchased energy from Edison Id at According to Edison the interruptible transmission it provided the Cities was interruptible for any reason Id at A purchase could be terminated the hour after it is begun or even during the hour Id As a result the Cities lost opportunities to make advantageous economy purchases Id at Edison also refused to provide customers flexibility similar to the flexibility Edison provided itself Edisons refusal to provide bidirectional transmission service restricted the Cities abilities to purchase hydroelectric energy from the Pacific Northwest Hoyt testimony at Because most contracts with Northwest utilities require a return of power the Northwest utilities would not deal with the Cities without transmission to return energy Id at Edison did provide bi directional transmission to the Los Angeles Department of Water Power LADWP to accommodate flows to and from Arizona Id Riverside was unable to obtain nonfirm service more than two hours in advance of need Carnahan testimony at Riverside and Colton were both served out of Edisons Vista substation Although the two cities were on the same kV bus Edison would not allow them to sell F energy to each other Greenwalt testimony at Riversides agreement with Edison allowed Riverside to purchase a block of energy through the WSPP and divide it up among the four Cities Azusa Banning Colton and Riverside Greenwalt testimony at When Riverside had excess energy from other sources Edison would not permit it to sell that energy to the other three cities Id For example Riverside attempted to sell Deseret energy transmitted by LADWP to the Edison system Id at LADWP would not break out the Cities shares of that energy and Edison would not accept the energy as a delivery for all four cities Id at Edison argued that because this energy was excess energy that Riverside could not use Riverside did not have transmission rights to bring it into the control area Id As a result Riverside paid for the energy delivered by LADWP to the Edison control area but could not sell it to the other three cities and gave it to Edison itself which consumed the energy without making any payment for it Id Riverside tried a number of alternative paths including using WSPP transmission where Riverside paid Edison mills to connect to Azusa mills to connect to Banning and mills to connect to Colton for each megawatthour While this approach was successful for a while eventually Edison refused to permit these sales Edison claimed that the Cities only have transmission rights to bring in enough Special Condition F energy to satisfy the Cities load Greenwalt testimony at Edison contended that the Cities load requirements were satisfied first by integrated resources and then by Special Condition and economy energy purchases Id at When the Cities integrated resources exceeded their load any Special Condition resources became excess Under Riversides Deseret contract the Cities were required to take a minimum of MW each hour Id Edison acknowledged that it was obligated to buy or allow the Cities to sell any excess energy from Riversides integrated resources Id However Edison refused to give the Cities credit for excess Special Condition energy brought into the area claiming that the Cities could not have brought it in because they did not have transmission rights Id II Other Examples of Transmission Disputes Disputes over transmission are not uncommon contrary to EEIs suggestion Some recent examples taken from pleadings and other documents and from Commission orders reveal that it has been very difficult for various entities in the electric power industry to agree on transmission rights These examples also reveal that even after issuance of AEP and the Open Access NOPR with its proposed pro forma tariffs there has been considerable controversy over whether various utilities open access tariffs deviate from those tariffs The Commission has allowed F utilities that adopt tariffs that match or exceed the nonrate terms and conditions in the NOPR pro forma tariffs to obtain certain benefits A In a letter of February to Mr Gerald Richman of the Commissions Enforcement section in the Office of the General Counsel Steven J Kean Vice President Regulatory Affairs Enron Power Marketing Inc Enron alleged that Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation NiMo refused to wheel power from Rochester Gas Electric RGE to Enron under RGEs transmission contract with NiMo however when Enron revealed the buyer NiMo did wheel power for RGE to the buyer Mr Kean alleged that this was not an isolated incident NiMo argued that the contract did not require it to provide RGE with transmission to Enron It also said that the principle of comparability does not require the service Letter of November from NiMo representative A Karen Hill to Gerald Richman B The Commissions Task Force Hot Line Hot Line received a complaint that a member of the New York Power Pool NYPP refused to transmit power that another member bought from a power marketer In a letter of November from Chair Moler to Mr William J Balet Executive Director of NYPP Chair Moler explained that the Commissions enforcement staff had investigated and found the allegation to be true F C In Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency v Northern States Power Company Minnesota FERC F NSP and SMMPA had a contract under which NSP agreed to provide transmission service However the parties had numerous disputes over the service The Commission found that NSP had misinterpreted the contract in several ways For example SMMPA argued that it should be able to directly schedule its deliveries of energy out of the NSP control area and that it should not be limited to particular points of delivery NSP argued that only it was entitled to control the physical operation of scheduling The Commission found that the clear language of the contracts gave SMMPA the authority to schedule its own power D MidContinent Area Power Pool FERC F involved MAPPs membership criteria which made it impossible for a power marketer to join MAPP and obtain the benefits of certain transmission services available only to MAPP members The Commission found that the membership criteria may be unreasonable particularly since there may be less burdensome ways of setting up membership criteria for nontraditional entities F

testimony before the ALJ the customers did not F address the need for Entergy to file a tariff However customers did make allegations of discriminatory practices as follows Customers alleged that Entergy flatout refused to wheel Louisiana Energy and Power Authority LEPA witness Sylvan J Richard testified that LEPAs predecessor systems could not obtain interconnections from Entergy Ex SJR at Customers also alleged that Entergy refused to provide service priority equal to native load and refused to provide service flexibility equivalent to the utilitys own use For example LEPA witness Richard testified that even after state commissions ordered interconnections and other coordination services LEPAs predecessors were still not able to obtain coordination services because Entergy was not willing to coordinate and because the transmission service it did offer was inflexible unidirectional pointtopoint service which prevented economic coordination with others Id at South Mississippi Electric Power Association SMEPA witness J Bertram Solomon testified that Entergys original open access tariff was restricted to pointto point service proposed separate charges for each operating company and required the cancellation of existing agreements in order to take service under the proposed tariff Ex SMEPA at Entergy eventually filed a F network tariff but proposed different local facilities charges for the various Entergy public utility operating subsidiaries Id at Since these local facilities charges were higher than the transmission component of the subsidiaries bundled rates Entergy obtained a competitive advantage Id The Arkansas Cities and Cooperatives ACC is a group of cities and cooperatives that own or operate electric generation or distribution systems in Arkansas ACC Witness Steven Merchant testified that Entergy has segregated the wholesale market between two of its subsidiaries Arkansas Power Light Copmpany APL and Entergy Power Inc EPI Ex SMM at In marketing power and energy in Arkansas EPI is subject to an Arkansas Commission order that bars EPI from competing with APL for wholesale loads without first obtaining a waiver Id Recently EPI requested this waiver for all wholesale transactions in Arkansas except for wholesale customers currently served by an Entergy subsidiary in other words EPI requested the Arkansas Commission to expand competition for all wholesale customers except where EPI might compete with APL Id ACC witness Merchant concluded that since EPI does not compete with APL Entergy insulates APLs wholesale business from competition and denies those wholesale customers access to EPI as a source of power thereby limiting alternative generation sources available to F ACC Id at Entergys witness Kenney stated that Entergy has recently filed a joint motion with ACC to the Arkansas Commission seeking to extend the waiver and permit EPI to sell to APLs wholesale customers Ex JFK at C Pacific Gas Electric Company PGE Northern California Power Agency NCPA attached several documents to its complaint in Docket No EL These documents were provided to support NCPAs claim that PGEs unreasonable practices under the PGENCPA Interconnection Agreement IA effectively denied NCPA access to transmission properly requested under the IA Although the parties eventually settled and the Commission terminated the docket with a letter order dated May these documents provide allegations of PGE using dilatory tactics that so protracted negotiations as to effectively equal a refusal to wheel PGE stated that since transmission was not currently available it was entitled to wait months before providing transmission that is transmission access could not be granted before the passing of the month notice period NCPA Complaint Ex However the IA All of these incidents are related to and examples of PGEs conduct described in the NOPR FERC Stats Regs F at n that is the history of PGEs attempt to avoid its commitments made to the California owners of the California Oregon Transmission Project COTP However these incidents are not exactly the same as the incidents described in the NOPR because NCPA is not one of the owners of the COTP F provided that transmission be provided when it becomes actually available PGE also requested substantial additional information which NCPA considered beyond that reasonably necessary for a study but still provided PGE then determined that transmission was not available reasoning that transmission was unavailable unless all the transmission requested could be provided hours per year without restrictions or limitations extending through the expiration of the agreement in NCPA Complaint at On November NCPA made a new transmission request to PGE seeking MW of bidirectional transmission at Midway NCPA Complaint Ex On January PGE filed an interconnection agreement with Turlock Irrigation District TID that provided TID with MW of bidirectional transmission at Midway Pacific Gas Electric Company FERC F order o n rehg FERC F On February PG E advised NCPA that all firm transmission service available at Midway had been fully subscribed NCPA Complaint Ex Then on March PGE filed with the Commission an interconnection agreement with Modesto Irrigation District MID that provided MID with MW of bi directional transmission at Midway Pacific Gas Electric Company FERC F At about the same time in the last week in March PGE advised NCPA that the F allocations of transmission to TID MID and others including a not yet finalized allocation to Sacramento Municipality Utility District had used all the transmission available at Midway NCPA Complaint Exs and D Northeast Utilities Service Company NU This is the case where Northeast Utilities acquired Public Service of New Hampshire PSNH Docket No EC New England Power Company NEP witness Robert Bigelows direct testimony expressed concern over the relatively restrictive transmission policies of both NU on behalf of Northeast Utilities public utility subsidiaries and PSNH Bigelow Direct Testimony at filed May In his cross rebuttal testimony Mr Bigelow testified that NU has a poor track record as a provider of transmission service and PSNH also has an abhorrent track record as a provider of transmission services Bigelow Cross Rebuttal Testimony at filed June Mr Bigelow described both NUs and NEPs his own company failure to provide service flexibility equivalent to their own use Except for NEPs TDUs both NEP and NU historically provided only pointtopoint transmission which required separate scheduling for each transaction Bigelow Cross Rebuttal at E Southern California Edison Company and San Diego Gas and Electric Company The evidence in this merger proceeding Docket No EC included testimony from a number of witnesses describing F instances of Edisons conduct Richard Greenwalt was the power supply supervisor for the City of Riverside California He was responsible for scheduling all purchases of energy for Riverside and for the cities of Azusa Banning and Colton California Greenwalt testimony at November These four cities and Anaheim California are collectively referred to as the Southern Cities or Cities Joseph Hsu was the Director of Utilities for Azusa Hsu testimony at November Gale Drews was the electric utility director of Colton Drews testimony at November Bill Carnahan was the director for Riverside Carnahan testimony at November Gordon Hoyt was the general manager of the Anaheim power department Hoyt testimony at November Dan McCann was the power coordination supervisor for Anaheim He supervised Anaheims load scheduling and is a former Edison employee having worked for Edison for years McCann Testimony at November These witnesses testified that Edison refused to wheel as follows Edisons policy was to curtail the Cities any time it could be justified using any of a list of acceptable reasons to deny interruptible transmission service Id at Edison would not generally provide transmission service when Edison could save money by itself purchasing the economy energy that would be wheeled McCann testimony at The Cities called Edison every hour to request interruptible transmission service Id Edison often F refused to sell energy available in the Western Systems Power Pool to the Cities and then made available higher cost contract energy or partial requirements service Id at When Anaheim requested Edison provide firm transmission of power from neighboring states Edison would often agree to provide nonfirm service but would not integrate the capacity for many years in the future saying that its control area did not need capacity at that time Hoyt testimony at Since the selling utility was interested in a sale of capacity not just energy the transaction would not occur Id Edison repeatedly used its control over transmission to deny Anaheim access to low cost firm power Id at While Edison provided shortterm firm transmission service to the Cities it would only provide longterm firm service for three specific resources the SONGS nuclear plant a specific IPP and Hoover Dam power Hoyt testimony at One of Edisons reasons for denying longterm transmission was that Edison desired to reserve the transmission for its own future unspecified needs Id In the s Edison refused to allow the Cities access to the Pacific Intertie Hoyt testimony at Drews testimony at In Edison refused to provide transmission service for a Cities power purchase from Public Service F Company of New Mexico PSNM from Palo Verde Nuclear station Hoyt testimony at Edison has refused to provide requested firm transmission from CaliforniaOregon border to Midway Station NevadaOregon Border to Sylmar Substation Palo Verde Switchyard to Vista SONGS Switchyard to Vista Carnahan testimony at Riverside requested transmission from Palo Verde and was told that such service was not available Carnahan testimony at Edison offered Riverside only MW of curtailable transmission entitlement to provide Riversides share of Palo Verde Id This service was neither large enough or long enough and Edison insisted on unreasonable terms and conditions Id Azusa Banning and Colton had a contract with Edison that entitled them to use their Palo Verde firm transmission path to schedule energy to meet their contract energy obligation Edison refused to permit the three cities to use that path Edison did not contest that the contracts allowed this use but said that the scheduling of such small amounts of energy for the three cities would be too burdensome Greenwalt testimony at Edison would not respond in a timely manner to the Cities requests routinely taking months to respond Drews F testimony at During the s Edison provided Colton with some transmission service to allow the Cities to reach certain suppliers but limited the choices available to the Cities and imposed terms and conditions that increased the Cities costs and placed Colton at a disadvantage against Edison Drews testimony at Arranging alternative generation sources was difficult because the Cities always had to first get Edison to state whether it would provide transmission During and a dispute arose between Edison and the Cities concerning the Hoover Uprating Project Drews testimony at Edison argued that for the months when units were out of service for uprating and Southern Cities capacity was reduced to zero Southern Cities would not receive an energy credit even though energy was still available and used by Edison But the contracts allowed a participant who did not have capacity to still schedule its energy as nonfirm energy on the capacity of another participant Id at In Azusa negotiated a power purchase contract with the California Department of Water Resources in increments of first MW and then MW for a total of MW Hsu testimony at First Edison assured Azusa that the transmission for the additional MW would not be a problem Id Then Edison would not agree to amend the transmission service agreement for the additional MW Id F In Azusa notified Edison of Special Condition purchases from PGE and requested firm transmission service Id Two months before service was to begin Edison notified the Cities of a problem with the transmission lines Id Transmission was eventually granted but only after a fourmonth delay and substantial losses to the Cities Id Then Edison decided there was no problem with its transmission facilities Id at In the Cities purchased MW from PGE and MW from Deseret GT Cooperative Hoyt testimony at Edison stated that without reinforcement of its transmission system Edison would not provide the transmission Id There was a fivemonth delay during which the Cities were forced to purchase from Edison at a higher cost Id at Then Edison decided that the transmission system did not need reinforcement Id at Edison also refused to provide a service priority equal to that of native load It would curtail the Cities in order to purchase more economy energy for itself McCann testimony at If Edison could make the purchase it would curtail the City and use the energy for itself Id When Edison curtailed the Cities they were not able to Special Condition of the Integrated Operations Agreement between Edison and the Southern Cities defined certain Special Condition resources and allowed the Cities to make certain uses of those resources subject to certain restrictions F purchase economy energy and instead purchased energy from Edison Id at According to Edison the interruptible transmission it provided the Cities was interruptible for any reason Id at A purchase could be terminated the hour after it is begun or even during the hour Id As a result the Cities lost opportunities to make advantageous economy purchases Id at Edison also refused to provide customers flexibility similar to the flexibility Edison provided itself Edisons refusal to provide bidirectional transmission service restricted the Cities abilities to purchase hydroelectric energy from the Pacific Northwest Hoyt testimony at Because most contracts with Northwest utilities require a return of power the Northwest utilities would not deal with the Cities without transmission to return energy Id at Edison did provide bi directional transmission to the Los Angeles Department of Water Power LADWP to accommodate flows to and from Arizona Id Riverside was unable to obtain nonfirm service more than two hours in advance of need Carnahan testimony at Riverside and Colton were both served out of Edisons Vista substation Although the two cities were on the same kV bus Edison would not allow them to sell F energy to each other Greenwalt testimony at Riversides agreement with Edison allowed Riverside to purchase a block of energy through the WSPP and divide it up among the four Cities Azusa Banning Colton and Riverside Greenwalt testimony at When Riverside had excess energy from other sources Edison would not permit it to sell that energy to the other three cities Id For example Riverside attempted to sell Deseret energy transmitted by LADWP to the Edison system Id at LADWP would not break out the Cities shares of that energy and Edison would not accept the energy as a delivery for all four cities Id at Edison argued that because this energy was excess energy that Riverside could not use Riverside did not have transmission rights to bring it into the control area Id As a result Riverside paid for the energy delivered by LADWP to the Edison control area but could not sell it to the other three cities and gave it to Edison itself which consumed the energy without making any payment for it Id Riverside tried a number of alternative paths including using WSPP transmission where Riverside paid Edison mills to connect to Azusa mills to connect to Banning and mills to connect to Colton for each megawatthour While this approach was successful for a while eventually Edison refused to permit these sales Edison claimed that the Cities only have transmission rights to bring in enough Special Condition F energy to satisfy the Cities load Greenwalt testimony at Edison contended that the Cities load requirements were satisfied first by integrated resources and then by Special Condition and economy energy purchases Id at When the Cities integrated resources exceeded their load any Special Condition resources became excess Under Riversides Deseret contract the Cities were required to take a minimum of MW each hour Id Edison acknowledged that it was obligated to buy or allow the Cities to sell any excess energy from Riversides integrated resources Id However Edison refused to give the Cities credit for excess Special Condition energy brought into the area claiming that the Cities could not have brought it in because they did not have transmission rights Id II Other Examples of Transmission Disputes Disputes over transmission are not uncommon contrary to EEIs suggestion Some recent examples taken from pleadings and other documents and from Commission orders reveal that it has been very difficult for various entities in the electric power industry to agree on transmission rights These examples also reveal that even after issuance of AEP and the Open Access NOPR with its proposed pro forma tariffs there has been considerable controversy over whether various utilities open access tariffs deviate from those tariffs The Commission has allowed F utilities that adopt tariffs that match or exceed the nonrate terms and conditions in the NOPR pro forma tariffs to obtain certain benefits A In a letter of February to Mr Gerald Richman of the Commissions Enforcement section in the Office of the General Counsel Steven J Kean Vice President Regulatory Affairs Enron Power Marketing Inc Enron alleged that Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation NiMo refused to wheel power from Rochester Gas Electric RGE to Enron under RGEs transmission contract with NiMo however when Enron revealed the buyer NiMo did wheel power for RGE to the buyer Mr Kean alleged that this was not an isolated incident NiMo argued that the contract did not require it to provide RGE with transmission to Enron It also said that the principle of comparability does not require the service Letter of November from NiMo representative A Karen Hill to Gerald Richman B The Commissions Task Force Hot Line Hot Line received a complaint that a member of the New York Power Pool NYPP refused to transmit power that another member bought from a power marketer In a letter of November from Chair Moler to Mr William J Balet Executive Director of NYPP Chair Moler explained that the Commissions enforcement staff had investigated and found the allegation to be true F C In Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency v Northern States Power Company Minnesota FERC F NSP and SMMPA had a contract under which NSP agreed to provide transmission service However the parties had numerous disputes over the service The Commission found that NSP had misinterpreted the contract in several ways For example SMMPA argued that it should be able to directly schedule its deliveries of energy out of the NSP control area and that it should not be limited to particular points of delivery NSP argued that only it was entitled to control the physical operation of scheduling The Commission found that the clear language of the contracts gave SMMPA the authority to schedule its own power D MidContinent Area Power Pool FERC F involved MAPPs membership criteria which made it impossible for a power marketer to join MAPP and obtain the benefits of certain transmission services available only to MAPP members The Commission found that the membership criteria may be unreasonable particularly since there may be less burdensome ways of setting up membership criteria for nontraditional entities F

May At todays meeting the Commissioners approved the consent agenda and then discussed the following items ELECTRIC MATTERS Alliance Companies et al Docket Nos ER In December the Commission issued an order conditionally authorizing the formation of the Alliance RTO At todays meeting the Commissioners denied by a margin of to Commissioner Hebert dissenting rehearing of the December order The Commissioners also unanimously rejected Commissioner Massey concurring Alliances compliance filing In its original filing Alliance proposed allowing each of its active owners to retain up to a percent ownership interest in the RTO up to percent total ownership by active owners The December order rejected this proposal as contrary to the independence principle outlined in Order No which states that active ownership should be limited to a total of percent unless special circumstances are shown Rejecting requests for rehearing the majority concluded that Alliance had failed to justify active member ownership in excess of percent Dissenting Commissioner Hebert argued that i the percent benchmark is arbitrary and should not be viewed as creating a binding legal requirement and ii limiting active ownership will provide a disincentive for other utilities to join the RTO The Commissioners also rejected Alliances compliance filing submitted to satisfy the terms of the December order In addition to failing to correct the active ownership issue outlined above the Commissioners faulted Alliance for not eliminating pancaked rates and for not addressing issues associated with the RTOs scope and configuration Commissioner Massey indicated that he would write a concurrence to stress that Aseams agreements do not negate the need to review the RTOs scope and configuration to ensure that it is properly designed and sized Southwest Power Pool Docket No EL The Commissioners unanimously rejected as failing to meet the requirements of Order No the Southwest Power Pools SPP RTO proposal Commissioner Massey who moved the item to the discussion agenda cited the following shortcomings in SPPs proposal i operational control of transmission facilities was not turned over to the RTO ii the RTOs proposed openaccess transmission tariff did not comply with Order No iii no realtime balancing market had been proposed iv lingering concerns with the RTOs governance structure and v the RTOs proposed scope and configuration are inadequate Commissioner Massey encouraged the SPP to join other entities seeking to form an RTO or consider merging with the Midwest ISO Notice of Interim Procedures to Support Reliability and Request for Comments Docket No EL The Commissioners unanimously approved shortterm procedures designed to address Summer reliability concerns The approved measures provide for i streamlining FERC procedures to promote onsite distributed generation ii waiving priornotice requirements for loadreduction agreements iii improving demandside price signals iv requiring more extensive OASIS posting of available transmission capacity and v making Commission Staff more available to the industry to address reliability concerns Comments on the proposed shortterm measures are due by June Additionally agreeing that the shortterm procedures are very minimal in nature the Commissioners requested comments on longterm reliability issues Comments are due by June Finally Commissioner Hebert indicated that he would write a separate concurrence to express his belief that competitive forces are the answer to reliability concerns and to criticize the Commission for not eliminating artificial price caps and promoting competitive rates Commissioner Heberts accusation that the Commission was more concerned with politics than good policy touched off a heated debate with Chairman Hoecker reciting FERC successes and Commissioner Massey scoffing at Commissioner Heberts suggestion that price caps were to blame for generation shortages GAS MATTERS Regulation of ShortTerm Natural Gas Transportation Services Regulation of Interstate Natural Gas Transportation Services Docket Nos RM RM The Commissioners unanimously addressed and generally denied requests for rehearing of Order No Finding that Order No strikes a good balance between competing interests the Commissioners indicated that their order would with several exceptions uphold the mandates of the order The Commissioners expressly noted that requests for rehearing of rightoffirstrefusal ROFR rollup issues would be denied Order No states that if a pipeline is fully subscribed a party wishing to exercise a ROFR will be required to match competing bids even if a competing bid exceeds the maximum rate for the capacity Revisions and clarifications of Order No approved by the Commissioners at todays meeting include shippers with multiyear contracts at max rates for seasonal service will retain their ROFR pipelines will be required to post available capacity within one hour of each nomination cycle rather than within one day as directed by Order shortterm capacity release transactions must be posted within one hour of the first nomination under the contract rather than upon the execution of the contract as stated in Order No and Order No s OFO penalty and imbalance provisions will be clarified in the Commission order Although comments at todays meeting were brief we anticipate a lengthy order addressing the numerous issues raised by parties in their requests for rehearing
<8263837.1075846372188.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,linda.lawrence@enron.com,2000-02-23 09:58:00,Commission Meeting February Hengerers summary of todays Commission meeting February MEMORANDUM TO Interested Clients FROM John Hengerer RE Commission Meeting February At todays meeting the Commissioners approved the consent agenda and discussed the following items HYDRO AGENDA Public Utility District No of Okanogan County Washington Docket No P This draft order rescinded the hydro license issued to Public Utility District No of Okanogan County Washington Utility District after the National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS conditioned the license on construction of a fish ladder that would have rendered the proposed project uneconomic Commissioner Hebert moved the item to the discussion agenda to highlight the difficulties incurred in hydro licensing proceedings due to the conditioning authority granted to certain federal agencies such as NMFS Because such agencies possess the authority to impose costly environmental conditions Commission Hebert stated they essentially hold veto power over project applications Commissioner Hebert urged federal agencies to weigh potential public benefits before imposing costly environmental conditions that doom proposed projects Avista Corporation Docket No P In this draft order the Commission granted a hydro license to Avista Corporation Chairman Hoecker moved the item to the discussion agenda to champion the use of alternate licensing procedures and applaud the parties for negotiating the settlement approved by the draft order Avista began negotiating for the license in and eventually reached a settlement with stakeholders According to Chairman Hebert such negotiations maximize benefits reduce application costs and set a positive example for other parties to follow Although the other Commissioners generally echoed Chairman Hoeckers praise Commissioner Hebert criticized the draft order for not quantifying the environmental benefits of Avistas proposed project ELECTRIC MATTERS New England Power Pool ISO New England Docket Nos ER et al Price caps on the ISOs Operating Reserve and Operable Capability markets were extended by the Commission in this draft order Commissioner Hebert dissenting Both caps expired on December The cap on the Operating Reserve Market was extended until June or until the ISO submits a market redesign plan to correct market flaws The cap on the Operable Capability Market was extended until February after which the market will be terminated According to the ISOs filing which was approved in this draft order the Operable Capability Market duplicates other ISO markets and is no longer needed Commissioner Hebert dissented and moved the item to the discussion agenda to express his disapproval of price caps both in general and in this particular proceeding In general Commissioner Hebert believes that price caps remove the natural incentives created by a competitive market In this particular proceeding Commission Hebert argues that supposedly temporary price caps have become a Acrutch relied on by the ISO Moreover Commissioner Hebert does not believe that the ISO market is flawed and contends that the ISO has failed to illustrate the existence of any flaws For these reasons Commissioner Hebert would not have extended the price caps Regional Transmission Organizations Order on Rehearing Docket No RM In this draft rehearing order while making relatively minor clarifications and revisions the Commission unanimously affirmed the policy decisions outlined in Order No FERC Issued in December Order No outlined the Commissions policy with regard to RTO formation and adopted regulations governing the filing and review of RTO proposals This draft order affirmed the voluntary and flexible approach adopted by Order No as well as the RTO functions and characteristics outlined in that order However the draft order does include a number of relatively minor revisions and clarifications Specifically the draft order i denies requests to phase out passive ownership of RTO facilities by transmission owners but clarifies that passive owners must not interfere with daytoday RTO operations ii clarifies Section tariff filing rights by reiterating that RTOs should have control of their own tariffs while transmission owners should determine their own return on equity iii incorporates Order No s audit requirements into Commission regulations while ruling that the both an RTOs ownership and governance structures are subject to audit and iv clarifies that public utility compliance filings must specify what efforts were made to include RTO participation by public cooperatives In approving the draft rehearing order only two months after the issuance of Order No the Commission hopes that the ongoing collaborative process will be able to focus on the basic elements of RTO formation rather than on the contentious issues raised in the rehearing requests Order No s collaborative process began this month and is scheduled to run through April Public Utilities not currently participating in a regional transmission entity are required to make a compliance filing by October while those utilities that are already a part of a regional entity must make a compliance filing by January Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator et al Docket Nos ER et al In this draft order the Commission unanimously Commissioner Massey concurring voiced its support for the binary RTO model proposed in this proceeding but declined to issue the requested declaratory order until a final proposal is filed The binary model proposed by Midwest ISO participants would require the ISO to delegate certain functions to a forprofit transco while retaining other functions and maintaining responsibility for overseeing the transcos activities The draft order commends parties for developing the proposal and finds that the proposed binary model generally conforms to the Commissions RTO mandate However the Commission declined to make a final determination until a complete proposal is submitted Commissioner Masseys concurrence raises concerns associated with the sharing of power between an ISO and a transco Commissioner Massey believes that such a division of power may be counterproductive and urges the parties to address the issue in their final filing PIPELINE MATTERS ANR Pipeline Company Docket No CP ANRs proposal to increase mainline capacity from Joliet Illinois into Wisconsin was approved in this draft order Specifically the draft order permits ANR to construct an additional horsepower of mainline capacity thereby increasing mainline capacity into Wisconsin by Dthday by November The Commission approved ANRs proposal after concluding that demand in Wisconsin justifies the expansion The expansion approved in this draft order is part of ANRs SupplyLink proposal to be built in conjunction with the IndependenceMarketLink project ANR decided to proceed with the JoliettoWisconsin expansion after the SupplyLinkIndependenceMarketLink project was delayed due to Commission concerns that the project was not adequately supported by market demand Although the expansion approved in this draft order was unrelated to the contentious portions of the larger project Commissioner Hebert nonetheless moved the item to the discussion agenda to express his belief that market demand justifies the IndependenceMarketLink project Specifically Commissioner Hebert cited recent spikes in heating oil prices as evidence that gas demand in the northeastern United States more than justifies the project Commissioner Breathitt disagreed with Commission Hebert and argued that the price of heating oil does not necessarily correlate to natural gas demand
