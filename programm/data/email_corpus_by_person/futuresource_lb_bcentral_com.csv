below newsnewsaspsearchbond FUTURESOURCECOM David lets start out with the US stock index futures Give us the lowdown HIGHTOWER One has to be impressed with the stock market action as prices gained while a number of commodity markets simply discounted the chain of better than expected US economic reports Even with the Congress doing everything they can to create ongoing recession conditions and the leadership of Al Qaeda apparently escaping the stock market maintained a positive tilt However we are concerned that the gains were simply holidayrelated and that the reality of slowing will manifest itself in a consolidation of the SP We think the SP will be restrained in a range bound by and until the corporate news or the layoff news begins to show consistent MESSAGE FROM A FAST BREAK

Alexander Elder and Neil Weintraub No cost or obligation It will be snailmailed to you ASAP adsmanfinancialhtm signs of improvement The fact that the initial claims figures have declined moderately could be a sign that the concern over the recovery timing is overdone However it would seem to be a tall order to get the US economy in position to recover prior to the second quarter which we think is needed in order to surprise the market into a rally beyond If for some reason the recovery is thrown back beyond the second quarter that could mean a temporary failure below the bottom of the expected trading range The fact that Congress failed to rise to the occasion is a major failure and with recent forecasts by the IMF warning of global recession or worse in one must continue to be skeptical toward the existing bull case The projected consolidation range in the Dow comes in at and Will Japan avoid financial collapse thereby spoiling the US recovery leadership FUTURESOURCECOM Jim give us your views on the US stock indexes WYCKOFF Price action in the US stock indexes the past couple weeks suggests they are rolling over from recent gentle uptrends into more sideways and choppy trading ranges I do not look for dramatic rallies or dramatic selloffs in the US stock indexes in the near to intermediate term I heard on a TV business channel this week that traders can expect a Santa Claus rally or the January effect to support the US stock market in the coming weeks One analyst said this is one of the easiest plays in stock trading While there is irrefutable evidence that there is in fact a Santa Claus rally or January effect in stocks nearly every year I do not believe that catching and participating in these rallies is easy Again it boils down to that allimportant timing factor in trading markets Ive been in this business long enough to have seen Santa Claus rallies that began in October and were finished before Christmas even arrived In fact that may be the case this year I am not ruling out a January rally in the stock market but technical analysis does suggest Santa Claus made an early visit to stock traders again this year with a moderate rally that began in late September and just recently stalled out Stock index bulls will regain the initiative if they can push their respective prices above the December highs If that does occur then the fabled January effect could unfold right on time this year FUTURESOURCECOM Okay fellas what about the Tbond futures market HIGHTOWER The rally in the US Tbond market over the last week might be explained as a rally in a bear market It is also possible that yields were high enough for some longterm players to decide to pull down some supply and lock the high rates of return With the continued anxiety over the Japanese economy it is also possible that some of the recent buying was flightto quality buying by investors concerned about a debacle there The US economic numbers released last week continued to foster the recovery mentality and that should eventually turn the bonds back down In the past two corrections against the downtrend bonds managed to points on the upside while the current correction just barely managed points on the bounce Therefore one should not assume that the downtrend has been altered unless of course upcoming economic numbers repeatedly dash the theme of recovery The bonds might end up being buffeted by the events in Japan as a wholesale failure in the Japanese economy that resulted in repatriation could cause heavy selling of US Treasuries Keep in mind that Japanese entities are massive holders of long term US Treasury debt It is possible that the December unemployment report released in early January will not show as dismal of a condition as was seen in the November figures However we would not be surprised if the bonds launch another recovery bounce into that time frame as that has been the pattern over the last three months The V bottom recovery is not as likely but recovery in the nd quarter of is an accepted reality in bond prices Therefore any serious charge against recovery could spark a larger than expected bond bounce FUTURESOURCECOM Jim give us your outlook for the bond market WYCKOFF A couple weeks ago the Tbond market shed more than five full points in three days This week the market tacked on about three points in three days Now thats some market volatility Indeed this week we did see a good shortcovering bounce in bonds However this weeks rebound is still just a goodsized technical correction in a strong bear market A bear flag

insightful Special Market Report Turn of the Century and your choice of an interactive CDROM tutorial video or audiocassette on options investing in a volatile adsbarkleyadhtm basis March TBonds The daily chart for the March contract shows a steep sevenweek downtrend line still in place Also on a longerterm chart basis a major doubletop reversal pattern on the monthly continuation chart for nearby TBond futures has formed March Tbond futures need to push above even to give the bulls a solid boost The good news for the bulls is that the monthly chart does reveal a strong support layer that did check the recent price declines Should prices jab down below that support zone however the odds greatly increase that the bears will do some feasting in the year and the bulls will be on the run My bias is that decent rallies in the bond market like we saw this week will be good selling opportunities and that the bear market will roll onuntil technical considerations signal the bulls have picked themselves up off the canvas FUTURESOURCECOM Thanks for your detailed analysis Dave and Jim Next week well be taking your pulse on two more important futures markets Stay tuned Powered by List

markets in the wake of a political and economic meltdown in Argentina and as two nucleararmed nations India and Pakistan step up their war rhetoric Lets get the opinions of two seasoned and respected market analysts David Hightower editor of the Hightower Report and Jim Wyckoff proprietor of Jim Wyckoff on the Markets FUTURESOURCECOM Dave give us a basic fundamental perspective on the US dollar and its major counterparts HIGHTOWER The US dollar appears to have an entrenched bullish sentiment over the Euro and we would expect interest in the dollar to increase into the kickoff of the physical Euro currency implementation However it would seem that the dollar was quickly shut off from further buying this past week when it reached above This is MESSAGE FROM A FAST BREAK SPONSOR Optimize your

Weintraub No cost or obligation It will be snailmailed to you ASAP adsmanfinancialhtm the second time that the dollar has been quickly repelled from that level We have been suggesting for weeks that the US dollar is holding an extreme premium versus most of the worlds currencies Therefore a leveling out of economic conditions would seem to pressure the dollar We also think that the US dollar has seen an unsustainable windfall off of Japanese yen weakness Therefore it is possible that the dollar will see a blowoff top in the coming week and that a major top could be formed Historically it would seem that several major turns in the currency markets have come in close proximity to the beginning of a new year In the event that the dollar does turn down we have to think that the Canadian and the Swiss will see the most significant recovery capacity FUTURESOURCECOM Jim give us more of a technical view on the US dollar index and the major IMM currency futures WYCKOFF The past two weeks have seen the March US dollar index spring sharply higher after prices had been trending lower during late November and the first have of December Last week the March dollar index hit a high of and has since seen some healthy consolidation of the recent strong gains The dollar index bulls indeed have the near term edge and the longerterm charts are also friendlier to the bulls If the bulls can

Market Report Turn of the Century and your choice of an interactive CDROM tutorial video or audiocassette on options investing in a volatile adsbarkleyadhtm that will give them the momentum to challenge the July high of A drop below means the market will likely languish in more of a choppy and sideways trading range in the near term Bulls should be warned that if prices do sell off from here a big headandshoulders top reversal pattern could develop on the weekly continuation chart for nearby dollar index futures But right now the bulls are enjoying the technical advantage As for the Euro currency the weekly continuation chart for nearby Euro futures should give the bulls some encouragement as well as throw a scare into US dollar index bulls A longer term downtrend line drawn off the high was penetrated on the upside and negated just about a year ago Since that time prices have been trading sideways in a choppy pattern This choppy trading has also formed a coiling patternwhereby the sideways trading range has become more compacted the past several weeks This is suggestive of a bigger breakouttype price move in the nottoodistant future Given the recent lowly price levels in the Euro odds do favor that potential breakout being to the upside There is also potential for a big doublebottom reversal pattern on the weekly chart Indeed there are clues on this chart that suggest the Euro currency bulls will enjoy more success in the coming year than they did in the past year From a shorterterm perspective if March Euro currency futures prices drop down below the November low of then the door is opened to much more downside If that low can hold and prices work higher then a big doublebottom reversal could be in the works Finally the Japanese yen has been in a nosedive for nearly two months This steep decline appears to be a washout or exhaustiontype selling phase that many times precedes a major change in trend But bottompickers should beware Right now wouldbe longside traders do not want to stand in front of a steaming locomotive They should first let the market show them some solid signals of strength before attempting to board the bullish train FUTURESOURCECOM Thanks for the comments Dave and Jim Well look forward to more of your insight in the coming weeks DISCLAIMER Futures and Options trading has large potential rewards but
