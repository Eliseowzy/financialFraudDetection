receiving action from Tues pm in both yy and yr albeit in smaller size into the dramatic sell off Swap spreads broadly tighter led by the front end with yr bps yr bps tighter Curve flattening on the sell off s bps flatter in swaps heading for bps flatter in cash the slack taken up by the extra narrowing in send swap spreads s bps flatter in line with cash curve flattening to leave yr spreads broadly unch yr underperforming curve badly with s fly around bps here there are a few offside posns at these lvls who could well get blown out if we push much further The market appears to have little appettite for risk at the moment as dealers appear to have been burnt over the larger more prolonged selloff than expected Price action and liquidity is very poor so far today No sign of Tresor in the last day or so despite higher yields EUR BONDS Same situation in Eur cash with the yr sector destroyed in the downmove with send somewhat anchored Today we have new Eurbn yr btan auction Jan trading around bp over the BTAN of July in the grey market This is expensive on terms of historical benchmark premium equates to around even to s in swap spread terms around bps rich to July btan in swap psrrad terms We are pretty indifferent at these lvls are seeing limited domestic interest but can see it continuing to trade quite expensive at least in the short term due to the equivilent richness in the yr deliverable german sector and the scarcity of alternative bonds in the area We also have the OAT reverse auction today with OAT Apr Oct and Apr will be bought back for a maximum of Eurbn with the yr sector trashed even more than the yr it makes sense for the tresor to be prepared to pay up a little to buy back still comparatively cheap bonds but little sense for end clients to tender altho maybe worth waiting in the tail you might just get filled EUR VIEWS Financial markets have been keen to anticipate a recovery in global economic activity But in Europe things still look bleak Euroland Q is coming in weaker than expected German GDP was in Q compared with our forecast of With Italy at and the Netherlands at Euroland GDP is unlikely to be better than We will have a more complete picture tomorrow with France our forecast is The October German Ifo survey was very disappointing particularly the further marked decline in business expectations from in August to in September to in October This is one of the best leading indicators of Euroland industrial activity and is one of the three components of the GS leading indicator Another component the Belgian manufacturing confidence index is out at pm today Perhaps most worrying of all our European equity analysts report another deterioration in economic activity in both Euroland and the UK in November see todays European Daily Comment for details With few exceptions our analysts report that economic conditions are still deteriorating or are stabilising at very low levels We are happy with our below consensus forecasts for GDP growth in of in Euroland consensus and in the UK consensus We also continue to believe that interest rates will fall by bp in both Euroland and the UK over the next months
