through hard times By PHILLIP MARSHALL Times Sports Staff AUBURN It started in dark and unhappy times for Auburns football team Five straight games had been lost Late in Tommy Tubervilles first season as head coach the team was fractured divided by the stress of almost two years of trouble despair and losing More Auburn football Talkin Tigers Forum It was defense and offense offensive tackle Kendall Simmons said Whatever happened we pointed fingers at each other On the Friday night before last Novembers game against Central Florida a small group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback Heath Evans They prayed They talked about life and the sometimes bitter turns it can take A bond began to grow among players young and old black and white starters and reserves It wasnt so much about winning and losing or even about football It was about matters of the heart We may have had guys show up that first night senior whip linebacker Rob Pate said Since then its just like another thing on the itinerary Its not mandatory but we have basically the whole team there Weve got five or six coaches Coach Tuberville comes in there People just lay out their hearts whatever is on their minds Auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that November night Players say theyve done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has grown ever stronger It has carried the thranked Tigers to a record going into Saturdays Southeastern Conference West Division showdown at thranked Mississippi State Pate says theyll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in the most difficult times Pate knows about pain and even fear A mysterious disease now seemingly under control threatened his senior season When you see a guy at his weakest point and hes reaching out asking you for help you know everything about a guy Pate said With me it was my health Before the first game they set a chair in the middle of the room and every guy in there put his hands on me We said a prayer together Man I was crying Its like that every weekend Somebody on this team is suffering through something They share it When you line up on Saturday its a lot easier to look at that person and know he is going to give it everything hes got On the field there has been little but happiness for Auburn this season Tuberville says it started when Auburn players strengthened by the bad times put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for their teammates and their school Ive never been around a team this close Tuberville said They get along We havent always played as great as we wanted to but weve had guys urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to get better Its just a special group They enjoy being around each other and understand what its going to take for us to win The change from not so long ago is striking Simmons says If you dont really know each other and everybody is in their own little group things arent going to work Simmons said If you have trust in your teammates you can build a good team Right now weve got that going It starts with the seniors who have seen the good and the bad of college football They went to the SEC Championship Game as freshmen in Then came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach Terry Bowden They revel in their success yet they know it can be ever so fleeting They take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back No one understands better than fifthyear senior quarterback Ben Leard He went from starter to third team in then won his job back in when hardly anyone thought he could Today he has the highest efficiency rating of any SEC quarterback We have been practicing since August and we have yet to hear anyone say Man Im looking forward to playing in the NFL Leard said No one is worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing statuswise Everybody just wants to win ball games The relationships we have on this team are like brothers Leard says nothing that happens can change that If we lose every game from now on this will be one of the most special seasons Ive ever had in my life Leard said Weve got people excited Were excited The fun is back in it for us Its a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to practice to see the guys to have fun and talk There are no fingers being pointed anywhere There are no individuals on this football team Evans was one who showed the way happily accepting the unglamorous role of blocker for tailback Rudi Johnson Every Friday night Evans is still the one who leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain Heath is just like that all the time Pate said Hes a great example of somebody who lives what he talks Hes a role model not just for younger people but for all of us

Phillip Subject Flying High All too rarely airline attendants make an effort to make the inflight safety lecture and their other announcements a bit more entertaining Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported On a Continental Flight with a very senior flight attendant crew pilot said Ladies and gentlemen weve reached cruising altitude and will be turning down the cabin lights This is for your comfort and to enhance the appearance of your flight attendants On landing the stewardess said Please be sure to take all your belongings If you are going to leave anything please make sure its something wed like to have There may be ways to leave your lover but there are only ways out of this airplane Thank you for flying Delta Business Express We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National a lone voice came over the loudspeaker Whoa big fella WHOA A flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because after a landing like that sure as hell everything has shifted From a Southwest Airlines employeeWelcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to YYY To operate your seat belt insert the metal tab into the buckle and pull tight It works just like every other seat belt and if you dont know how to operate one you probably shouldnt be out in public unsupervised In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure masks will descend from the ceiling Stop screaming grab the mask and pull it over your face If you have a small child traveling with you secure your mask before assisting with theirs If you are traveling with more than one small childpick your favorite Weather at our destination is degrees with some broken clouds but well try to have them fixed before we arrive Thank you and remember nobody loves you or your money more than Southwest Airlines Your seat cushions can be used for flotation and in the event of an emergency water landing please paddle to shore and take them with our compliments Should the cabin lose pressure oxygen masks will drop from the overhead area Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose before assisting children or other adults acting like children As you exit the plane make sure to gather all of your belongings Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants Please do not leave children or spouses Last one off the plane must clean it And from the pilot during his welcome message Delta airlines is pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry Unfortunately none of them are on this flight Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake City The flight attendant came on the intercom and said That was quite a bump and I know what yall are thinking Im here to tell you it wasnt the airlines fault it wasnt the pilots fault it wasnt the flight attendants fault it was the asphalt Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo Texas on a particularly windy and bumpy day During the final approach the Captain was really having to fight it After an extremely hard landing the Flight Attendant said Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to Amarillo Please remain in your seats with your seat belts fastened while the Captain taxis whats left of our airplane to the gate Another flight attendants comment on a less than perfect landing We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited smile and give them a Thanks for flying XYZ airline He said that in light of his bad landing he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye thinking that someone would have a smart comment Finally everyone had gotten off except for a little old lady walking with a cane She said Sonny mind if I ask you a question Why no Maam said the pilot what is it The little old lady asked Did we land or were we shot down After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix the Flight Attendant came on with Ladies and Gentlemen please remain in your seats until CaptCrash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt against the gate And once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced well open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal Part of a flight attendants arrival announcement Wed like to thank you folks for flying with us today And the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube we hope youll think of US Airways A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude the captain made an announcement over the intercom Ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking Welcome to Flight Number nonstop from New York to Los Angeles The weather ahead is good and therefore we should have a smooth and uneventful flight Now sit back and relax OH MY GOD Silence followed and after a few minutes the captain came back on the intercom and said Ladies and Gentlemen I am so sorry if I scared you earlier but while I was talking the flight attendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap You should see the front of my pants A passenger in Coach said Thats nothing he should see the back of mine

this my apologies On the other hand if not please read and forward around the world Nike now lets you personalize your shoes by submitting a word or phrase which they will stitch onto your shoes under the swoosh So Jonah Peretti filled out the form and sent them to stitch sweatshop onto his shoes Heres the responses he got fun and games with Nike From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Your NIKE iD order was cancelled for one or more of the following reasons Your Personal iD contains another partys trademark Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we do not have the legal right to use Your Personal iD was left blank Did you not want any personalization Your Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang and besides your mother would slap us If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Greetings My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate any of the criteria outlined in your message The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word sweatshop Sweatshop is not anothers partys trademark the name of an athlete blank or profanity I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor of the children that made my shoes Could you please ship them to me immediately Thanks and Happy New Year Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have chosen contains as stated in the previous email correspondence inappropriate slang If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at nikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes Although I commend you for your prompt customer service I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was inappropriate slang After consulting Websters Dictionary I discovered that sweatshop is in fact part of standard English and not slang The word means a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long hours at low wages and under unhealthy conditions and its origin dates from So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first email Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is about freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are I share Nikes love of freedom and personal expression The site also says that If you want it done rightbuild it yourself I was thrilled to be able to build my own shoes and my personal iD was offered as a small token of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to reject my order Thank you Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE iD web site that Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to hours after it has been submitted In addition it further explains While we honor most personal iDs we cannot honor every one Some may be or contain others trademarks or the names of certain professional sports teams athletes or celebrities that Nike does not have the right to use Others may contain material that we consider inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products Unfortunately at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that may otherwise seem unobjectionable In any event we will let you know if we decline your personal iD and we will offer you the chance to submit another With these rules in mind we cannot accept your order as submitted If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request I have decided to order the shoes with a different iD but I would like to make one small request Could you please send me a color snapshot of the tenyearold Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes Thanks Jonah Peretti As one forwarder writes this will now go round the world much farther and faster than any of the adverts they paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all their

through hard times By PHILLIP MARSHALL Times Sports Staff AUBURN It started in dark and unhappy times for Auburns football team Five straight games had been lost Late in Tommy Tubervilles first season as head coach the team was fractured divided by the stress of almost two years of trouble despair and losing More Auburn football Talkin Tigers Forum It was defense and offense offensive tackle Kendall Simmons said Whatever happened we pointed fingers at each other On the Friday night before last Novembers game against Central Florida a small group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback Heath Evans They prayed They talked about life and the sometimes bitter turns it can take A bond began to grow among players young and old black and white starters and reserves It wasnt so much about winning and losing or even about football It was about matters of the heart We may have had guys show up that first night senior whip linebacker Rob Pate said Since then its just like another thing on the itinerary Its not mandatory but we have basically the whole team there Weve got five or six coaches Coach Tuberville comes in there People just lay out their hearts whatever is on their minds Auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that November night Players say theyve done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has grown ever stronger It has carried the thranked Tigers to a record going into Saturdays Southeastern Conference West Division showdown at thranked Mississippi State Pate says theyll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in the most difficult times Pate knows about pain and even fear A mysterious disease now seemingly under control threatened his senior season When you see a guy at his weakest point and hes reaching out asking you for help you know everything about a guy Pate said With me it was my health Before the first game they set a chair in the middle of the room and every guy in there put his hands on me We said a prayer together Man I was crying Its like that every weekend Somebody on this team is suffering through something They share it When you line up on Saturday its a lot easier to look at that person and know he is going to give it everything hes got On the field there has been little but happiness for Auburn this season Tuberville says it started when Auburn players strengthened by the bad times put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for their teammates and their school Ive never been around a team this close Tuberville said They get along We havent always played as great as we wanted to but weve had guys urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to get better Its just a special group They enjoy being around each other and understand what its going to take for us to win The change from not so long ago is striking Simmons says If you dont really know each other and everybody is in their own little group things arent going to work Simmons said If you have trust in your teammates you can build a good team Right now weve got that going It starts with the seniors who have seen the good and the bad of college football They went to the SEC Championship Game as freshmen in Then came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach Terry Bowden They revel in their success yet they know it can be ever so fleeting They take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back No one understands better than fifthyear senior quarterback Ben Leard He went from starter to third team in then won his job back in when hardly anyone thought he could Today he has the highest efficiency rating of any SEC quarterback We have been practicing since August and we have yet to hear anyone say Man Im looking forward to playing in the NFL Leard said No one is worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing statuswise Everybody just wants to win ball games The relationships we have on this team are like brothers Leard says nothing that happens can change that If we lose every game from now on this will be one of the most special seasons Ive ever had in my life Leard said Weve got people excited Were excited The fun is back in it for us Its a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to practice to see the guys to have fun and talk There are no fingers being pointed anywhere There are no individuals on this football team Evans was one who showed the way happily accepting the unglamorous role of blocker for tailback Rudi Johnson Every Friday night Evans is still the one who leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain Heath is just like that all the time Pate said Hes a great example of somebody who lives what he talks Hes a role model not just for younger people but for all of us

Phillip Subject Flying High All too rarely airline attendants make an effort to make the inflight safety lecture and their other announcements a bit more entertaining Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported On a Continental Flight with a very senior flight attendant crew pilot said Ladies and gentlemen weve reached cruising altitude and will be turning down the cabin lights This is for your comfort and to enhance the appearance of your flight attendants On landing the stewardess said Please be sure to take all your belongings If you are going to leave anything please make sure its something wed like to have There may be ways to leave your lover but there are only ways out of this airplane Thank you for flying Delta Business Express We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National a lone voice came over the loudspeaker Whoa big fella WHOA A flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because after a landing like that sure as hell everything has shifted From a Southwest Airlines employeeWelcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to YYY To operate your seat belt insert the metal tab into the buckle and pull tight It works just like every other seat belt and if you dont know how to operate one you probably shouldnt be out in public unsupervised In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure masks will descend from the ceiling Stop screaming grab the mask and pull it over your face If you have a small child traveling with you secure your mask before assisting with theirs If you are traveling with more than one small childpick your favorite Weather at our destination is degrees with some broken clouds but well try to have them fixed before we arrive Thank you and remember nobody loves you or your money more than Southwest Airlines Your seat cushions can be used for flotation and in the event of an emergency water landing please paddle to shore and take them with our compliments Should the cabin lose pressure oxygen masks will drop from the overhead area Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose before assisting children or other adults acting like children As you exit the plane make sure to gather all of your belongings Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants Please do not leave children or spouses Last one off the plane must clean it And from the pilot during his welcome message Delta airlines is pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry Unfortunately none of them are on this flight Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake City The flight attendant came on the intercom and said That was quite a bump and I know what yall are thinking Im here to tell you it wasnt the airlines fault it wasnt the pilots fault it wasnt the flight attendants fault it was the asphalt Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo Texas on a particularly windy and bumpy day During the final approach the Captain was really having to fight it After an extremely hard landing the Flight Attendant said Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to Amarillo Please remain in your seats with your seat belts fastened while the Captain taxis whats left of our airplane to the gate Another flight attendants comment on a less than perfect landing We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited smile and give them a Thanks for flying XYZ airline He said that in light of his bad landing he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye thinking that someone would have a smart comment Finally everyone had gotten off except for a little old lady walking with a cane She said Sonny mind if I ask you a question Why no Maam said the pilot what is it The little old lady asked Did we land or were we shot down After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix the Flight Attendant came on with Ladies and Gentlemen please remain in your seats until CaptCrash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt against the gate And once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced well open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal Part of a flight attendants arrival announcement Wed like to thank you folks for flying with us today And the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube we hope youll think of US Airways A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude the captain made an announcement over the intercom Ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking Welcome to Flight Number nonstop from New York to Los Angeles The weather ahead is good and therefore we should have a smooth and uneventful flight Now sit back and relax OH MY GOD Silence followed and after a few minutes the captain came back on the intercom and said Ladies and Gentlemen I am so sorry if I scared you earlier but while I was talking the flight attendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap You should see the front of my pants A passenger in Coach said Thats nothing he should see the back of mine

order o Greetings My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate any of the criteria outlined in your message The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word

USA running shoes Although I commend you for your prompt customer service I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was inappropriate slang After consulting Websters Dictionary I discovered that sweatshop is in fact part of standard English and not slang The word means a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long hours at low wages and under unhealthy conditions and its origin dates from So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first email Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is about freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are I share Nikes love of freedom and personal expression The site also says that If you want it done rightbuild it yourself I was thrilled to be able to build my own shoes and my personal iD was offered as a small token of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to reject my order Thank you Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE iD web site that Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to hours after it has been submitted In addition it further explains While we honor most personal iDs we cannot honor every one Some may be or contain others trademarks or the names of certain professional sports teams athletes or celebrities that Nike does not have the right to use Others may contain material that we consider inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products Unfortunately at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that may otherwise seem unobjectionable In any event we will let you know if we decline your personal iD and we will offer you the chance to submit another With these rules in mind we cannot accept your order as submitted If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my

through hard times By PHILLIP MARSHALL Times Sports Staff AUBURN It started in dark and unhappy times for Auburns football team Five straight games had been lost Late in Tommy Tubervilles first season as head coach the team was fractured divided by the stress of almost two years of trouble despair and losing More Auburn football Talkin Tigers Forum It was defense and offense offensive tackle Kendall Simmons said Whatever happened we pointed fingers at each other On the Friday night before last Novembers game against Central Florida a small group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback Heath Evans They prayed They talked about life and the sometimes bitter turns it can take A bond began to grow among players young and old black and white starters and reserves It wasnt so much about winning and losing or even about football It was about matters of the heart We may have had guys show up that first night senior whip linebacker Rob Pate said Since then its just like another thing on the itinerary Its not mandatory but we have basically the whole team there Weve got five or six coaches Coach Tuberville comes in there People just lay out their hearts whatever is on their minds Auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that November night Players say theyve done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has grown ever stronger It has carried the thranked Tigers to a record going into Saturdays Southeastern Conference West Division showdown at thranked Mississippi State Pate says theyll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in the most difficult times Pate knows about pain and even fear A mysterious disease now seemingly under control threatened his senior season When you see a guy at his weakest point and hes reaching out asking you for help you know everything about a guy Pate said With me it was my health Before the first game they set a chair in the middle of the room and every guy in there put his hands on me We said a prayer together Man I was crying Its like that every weekend Somebody on this team is suffering through something They share it When you line up on Saturday its a lot easier to look at that person and know he is going to give it everything hes got On the field there has been little but happiness for Auburn this season Tuberville says it started when Auburn players strengthened by the bad times put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for their teammates and their school Ive never been around a team this close Tuberville said They get along We havent always played as great as we wanted to but weve had guys urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to get better Its just a special group They enjoy being around each other and understand what its going to take for us to win The change from not so long ago is striking Simmons says If you dont really know each other and everybody is in their own little group things arent going to work Simmons said If you have trust in your teammates you can build a good team Right now weve got that going It starts with the seniors who have seen the good and the bad of college football They went to the SEC Championship Game as freshmen in Then came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach Terry Bowden They revel in their success yet they know it can be ever so fleeting They take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back No one understands better than fifthyear senior quarterback Ben Leard He went from starter to third team in then won his job back in when hardly anyone thought he could Today he has the highest efficiency rating of any SEC quarterback We have been practicing since August and we have yet to hear anyone say Man Im looking forward to playing in the NFL Leard said No one is worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing statuswise Everybody just wants to win ball games The relationships we have on this team are like brothers Leard says nothing that happens can change that If we lose every game from now on this will be one of the most special seasons Ive ever had in my life Leard said Weve got people excited Were excited The fun is back in it for us Its a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to practice to see the guys to have fun and talk There are no fingers being pointed anywhere There are no individuals on this football team Evans was one who showed the way happily accepting the unglamorous role of blocker for tailback Rudi Johnson Every Friday night

the swoosh So Jonah Peretti filled out the form and sent them to stitch sweatshop onto his shoes Heres the responses he got fun and games with Nike From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Your NIKE iD order was cancelled for one or more of the following reasons Your Personal iD contains another partys trademark Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we do not have the legal right to use Your Personal iD was left blank Did you not want any personalization Your Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang and besides your mother would slap us If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Greetings My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate any of the criteria outlined in your message The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word sweatshop Sweatshop is not anothers partys trademark the name of an athlete blank or profanity I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor of the children that made my shoes Could you please ship them to me immediately Thanks and Happy New Year Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have chosen contains as stated in the previous email correspondence inappropriate slang If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at nikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes Although I commend you for your prompt customer service I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was inappropriate slang After consulting Websters Dictionary I discovered that sweatshop is in fact part of standard English and not slang The word means a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long hours at low wages and under unhealthy conditions and its origin dates from So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first email Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is about freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are I share Nikes love of freedom and personal expression The site also says that If you want it done rightbuild it yourself I was thrilled to be able to build my own shoes and my personal iD was offered as a small token of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to reject my order Thank you Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE iD web site that Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to hours after it has been submitted In addition it further explains While we honor most personal iDs we cannot honor every one Some may be or contain others trademarks or the names of certain professional sports teams athletes or celebrities that Nike does not have the right to use Others may contain material that we consider inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products Unfortunately at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that may otherwise seem unobjectionable In any event we will let you know if we decline your personal iD and we will offer you the chance to submit another With these rules in mind we cannot accept your order as submitted If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request I have decided to order the shoes with a different iD but I would like to make one small request Could you please send me a color snapshot of the tenyearold Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes Thanks Jonah Peretti As one forwarder writes this will now go round the world much farther and faster than any of the adverts they paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all their

Phillip Subject Flying High All too rarely airline attendants make an effort to make the inflight safety lecture and their other announcements a bit more entertaining Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported On a Continental Flight with a very senior flight attendant crew pilot said Ladies and gentlemen weve reached cruising altitude and will be turning down the cabin lights This is for your comfort and to enhance the appearance of your flight attendants On landing the stewardess said Please be sure to take all your belongings If you are going to leave anything please make sure its something wed like to have There may be ways to leave your lover but there are only ways out of this airplane Thank you for flying Delta Business Express We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National a lone voice came over the loudspeaker Whoa big fella WHOA A flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because after a landing like that sure as hell everything has shifted From a Southwest Airlines employeeWelcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to YYY To operate your seat belt insert the metal tab into the buckle and pull tight It works just like every other seat belt and if you dont know how to operate one you probably shouldnt be out in public unsupervised In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure masks will descend from the ceiling Stop screaming grab the mask and pull it over your face If you have a small child traveling with you secure your mask before assisting with theirs If you are traveling with more than one small childpick your favorite Weather at our destination is degrees with some broken clouds but well try to have them fixed before we arrive Thank you and remember nobody loves you or your money more than Southwest Airlines Your seat cushions can be used for flotation and in the event of an emergency water landing please paddle to shore and take them with our compliments Should the cabin lose pressure oxygen masks will drop from the overhead area Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose before assisting children or other adults acting like children As you exit the plane make sure to gather all of your belongings Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants Please do not leave children or spouses Last one off the plane must clean it And from the pilot during his welcome message Delta airlines is pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry Unfortunately none of them are on this flight Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake City The flight attendant came on the intercom and said That was quite a bump and I know what yall are thinking Im here to tell you it wasnt the airlines fault it wasnt the pilots fault it wasnt the flight attendants fault it was the asphalt Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo Texas on a particularly windy and bumpy day During the final approach the Captain was really having to fight it After an extremely hard landing the Flight Attendant said Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to Amarillo Please remain in your seats with your seat belts fastened while the Captain taxis whats left of our airplane to the gate Another flight attendants comment on a less than perfect landing We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited smile and give them a Thanks for flying XYZ airline He said that in light of his bad landing he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye thinking that someone would have a smart comment Finally everyone had gotten off except for a little old lady walking with a cane She said Sonny mind if I ask you a question Why no Maam said the pilot what is it The little old lady asked Did we land or were we shot down After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix the Flight Attendant came on with Ladies and Gentlemen please remain in your seats until CaptCrash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt against the gate And once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced well open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal Part of a flight attendants arrival announcement Wed like to thank you folks for flying with us today And the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube we hope youll think of US Airways A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude the captain made an announcement over the intercom Ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking Welcome to Flight Number nonstop from New York to Los Angeles The weather ahead is good and therefore we should have a smooth and uneventful flight Now sit back and relax OH MY GOD Silence followed and after a few minutes the captain came back on the intercom and said Ladies and Gentlemen I am so sorry if I scared you earlier but while I was talking the flight attendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap You should see the front of my pants A passenger in Coach said Thats nothing he should see the back of mine

through hard times By PHILLIP MARSHALL Times Sports Staff AUBURN It started in dark and unhappy times for Auburns football team Five straight games had been lost Late in Tommy Tubervilles first season as head coach the team was fractured divided by the stress of almost two years of trouble despair and losing More Auburn football Talkin Tigers Forum It was defense and offense offensive tackle Kendall Simmons said Whatever happened we pointed fingers at each other On the Friday night before last Novembers game against Central Florida a small group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback Heath Evans They prayed They talked about life and the sometimes bitter turns it can take A bond began to grow among players young and old black and white starters and reserves It wasnt so much about winning and losing or even about football It was about matters of the heart We may have had guys show up that first night senior whip linebacker Rob Pate said Since then its just like another thing on the itinerary Its not mandatory but we have basically the whole team there Weve got five or six coaches Coach Tuberville comes in there People just lay out their hearts whatever is on their minds Auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that November night Players say theyve done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has grown ever stronger It has carried the thranked Tigers to a record going into Saturdays Southeastern Conference West Division showdown at thranked Mississippi State Pate says theyll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in the most difficult times Pate knows about pain and even fear A mysterious disease now seemingly under control threatened his senior season When you see a guy at his weakest point and hes reaching out asking you for help you know everything about a guy Pate said With me it was my health Before the first game they set a chair in the middle of the room and every guy in there put his hands on me We said a prayer together Man I was crying Its like that every weekend Somebody on this team is suffering through something They share it When you line up on Saturday its a lot easier to look at that person and know he is going to give it everything hes got On the field there has been little but happiness for Auburn this season Tuberville says it started when Auburn players strengthened by the bad times put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for their teammates and their school Ive never been around a team this close Tuberville said They get along We havent always played as great as we wanted to but weve had guys urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to get better Its just a special group They enjoy being around each other and understand what its going to take for us to win The change from not so long ago is striking Simmons says If you dont really know each other and everybody is in their own little group things arent going to work Simmons said If you have trust in your teammates you can build a good team Right now weve got that going It starts with the seniors who have seen the good and the bad of college football They went to the SEC Championship Game as freshmen in Then came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach Terry Bowden They revel in their success yet they know it can be ever so fleeting They take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back No one understands better than fifthyear senior quarterback Ben Leard He went from starter to third team in then won his job back in when hardly anyone thought he could Today he has the highest efficiency rating of any SEC quarterback We have been practicing since August and we have yet to hear anyone say Man Im looking forward to playing in the NFL Leard said No one is worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing statuswise Everybody just wants to win ball games The relationships we have on this team are like brothers Leard says nothing that happens can change that If we lose every game from now on this will be one of the most special seasons Ive ever had in my life Leard said Weve got people excited Were excited The fun is back in it for us Its a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to practice to see the guys to have fun and talk There are no fingers being pointed anywhere There are no individuals on this football team Evans was one who showed the way happily accepting the unglamorous role of blocker for tailback Rudi Johnson Every Friday night Evans is still the one who leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain Heath is just like that all the time Pate said Hes a great example of somebody who lives what he talks Hes a role model not just for younger people but for all of us

Phillip Subject Flying High All too rarely airline attendants make an effort to make the inflight safety lecture and their other announcements a bit more entertaining Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported On a Continental Flight with a very senior flight attendant crew pilot said Ladies and gentlemen weve reached cruising altitude and will be turning down the cabin lights This is for your comfort and to enhance the appearance of your flight attendants On landing the stewardess said Please be sure to take all your belongings If you are going to leave anything please make sure its something wed like to have There may be ways to leave your lover but there are only ways out of this airplane Thank you for flying Delta Business Express We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National a lone voice came over the loudspeaker Whoa big fella WHOA A flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because after a landing like that sure as hell everything has shifted From a Southwest Airlines employeeWelcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to YYY To operate your seat belt insert the metal tab into the buckle and pull tight It works just like every other seat belt and if you dont know how to operate one you probably shouldnt be out in public unsupervised In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure masks will descend from the ceiling Stop screaming grab the mask and pull it over your face If you have a small child traveling with you secure your mask before assisting with theirs If you are traveling with more than one small childpick your favorite Weather at our destination is degrees with some broken clouds but well try to have them fixed before we arrive Thank you and remember nobody loves you or your money more than Southwest Airlines Your seat cushions can be used for flotation and in the event of an emergency water landing please paddle to shore and take them with our compliments Should the cabin lose pressure oxygen masks will drop from the overhead area Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose before assisting children or other adults acting like children As you exit the plane make sure to gather all of your belongings Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants Please do not leave children or spouses Last one off the plane must clean it And from the pilot during his welcome message Delta airlines is pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry Unfortunately none of them are on this flight Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake City The flight attendant came on the intercom and said That was quite a bump and I know what yall are thinking Im here to tell you it wasnt the airlines fault it wasnt the pilots fault it wasnt the flight attendants fault it was the asphalt Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo Texas on a particularly windy and bumpy day During the final approach the Captain was really having to fight it After an extremely hard landing the Flight Attendant said Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to Amarillo Please remain in your seats with your seat belts fastened while the Captain taxis whats left of our airplane to the gate Another flight attendants comment on a less than perfect landing We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited smile and give them a Thanks for flying XYZ airline He said that in light of his bad landing he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye thinking that someone would have a smart comment Finally everyone had gotten off except for a little old lady walking with a cane She said Sonny mind if I ask you a question Why no Maam said the pilot what is it The little old lady asked Did we land or were we shot down After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix the Flight Attendant came on with Ladies and Gentlemen please remain in your seats until CaptCrash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt against the gate And once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced well open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal Part of a flight attendants arrival announcement Wed like to thank you folks for flying with us today And the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube we hope youll think of US Airways A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude the captain made an announcement over the intercom Ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking Welcome to Flight Number nonstop from New York to Los Angeles The weather ahead is good and therefore we should have a smooth and uneventful flight Now sit back and relax OH MY GOD Silence followed and after a few minutes the captain came back on the intercom and said Ladies and Gentlemen I am so sorry if I scared you earlier but while I was talking the flight attendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap You should see the front of my pants A passenger in Coach said Thats nothing he should see the back of mine

RE Your NIKE iD order o Your NIKE iD order was cancelled for one or more of the following reasons Your Personal iD contains another partys trademark Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we do not have the legal right to use Your Personal iD was left blank Did you not want any personalization Your Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang and besides your mother would

order o Greetings My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate any of the criteria outlined in your message The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word

USA running shoes Although I commend you for your prompt customer service I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was inappropriate slang After consulting Websters Dictionary I discovered that sweatshop is in fact part of standard English and not slang The word means a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long hours at low wages and under unhealthy conditions and its origin dates from So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first email Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is about freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are I share Nikes love of freedom and personal expression The site also says that If you want it done rightbuild it yourself I was thrilled to be able to build my own shoes and my personal iD was offered as a small token of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to reject my order Thank you Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE iD web site that Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to hours after it has been submitted In addition it further explains While we honor most personal iDs we cannot honor every one Some may be or contain others trademarks or the names of certain professional sports teams athletes or celebrities that Nike does not have the right to use Others may contain material that we consider inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products Unfortunately at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that may otherwise seem unobjectionable In any event we will let you know if we decline your personal iD and we will offer you the chance to submit another With these rules in mind we cannot accept your order as submitted If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my
