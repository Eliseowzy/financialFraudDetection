wide range of emerging technologies info tech biotechmedical new materials energy communications and spacerelated technologies etc happen sooner and better than they might have otherwise WTN is made up of not just of the technologists but also the financiers marketers journalists policy makers etc all of those who have a role at one time or another in making technological concepts come to fruition We are identifying the people who will likely play a key role in the technological drama over the next years and decades and bringing them together to create relationships that will accelerate the application of these technologies We are trying to increase the chances of the happy accidents which can occur when cuttingedge ideas entrepreneurial people and institutions with vision collide to create innovation We like to say that our main goal is encouraging serendipity Who is a WTN member WTNs membership is primarily composed of laureates of our World Technology Award program who are selected through a rigorous process involving over nominators and judges It includes leading technology and business innovators such as Steve Jobs of Apple John Chambers of Cisco Masayoshi Son of Softbank etc These are the people driving the future and they are the sort of people brought into the Network Other Finalists or Winners for the World Technology Awards who were therefore inducted as members included Jeff HawkinsDonna Dubinsky cocreators Palm Computer for ITHardware John Sulston Director Sanger Centre for Biotechnology Dave Thompson founder Orbital Sciences for Space Amory Lovins cofounder Rocky Mountain Institute for Environment Geoffrey Ballard founder Ballard Power Systems for Energy etc A full list of the laureates can be found on the WTN web site The WTN membership is truly extraordinary and the WTN membership is the core of who is invited to the World Technology Summit What is the World Technology Summit The World Technology Summit is an historic twoday gathering July of several hundred of the worlds key technology players scientists technologists entrepreneurs industrialists financiers journalists and policymakers to explore and catalyse the emerging technologies that will have the greatest impact upon industry and society in the st Century and to create the relationships which will help those technologies and the companies behind them to succeed The Summit brings together Network Members Fellows and other specially invited delegates to think deeply about emerging technologies how they will likely impact tomorrow on todays industries and those industries yet to be born The Summit will cover six key technologies information communications materials energy biotechnologymedicine and space as well as developments in the other related areas of finance marketing policy etc which determine whether a good idea ever becomes more than an idea Where Will the World Technology Summit Be Held The Summit will be hosted at one of the most prestigious scientific institutions in the world Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine in London Located in the beautiful South Kensington area of London nestled amongst the National Museum of Science Industry the Victoria Albert Museum the Natural History Museum and the Royal Albert Hall Imperial College was recently ranked second above Oxford University in the UK university league tables Sir Richard Sykes the new head Rector of Imperial College who also serves as Chairman of the newly merged GlaxoSmithkline will be actively participating in the Summit both as a speaker and in his role as host What about the World Technology Awards The last evening of the Summit will be capped by a gala ceremony during which we will present the second annual World Technology Awards recognising those involved in technology who are taking the actions and making the decisions with the greatest likely longterm impact on business and society Awards are given in categories The World Technology Award for information technologyhardware information technologysoftware communications technology biotechnology space health medicine energy materials policy entrepreneurship design the arts media journalism finance commerce marketing communications law transportation environment education entertainment social entrepreneurship ethics Innovator of the Year Each of the cuttingedge Award finalists and eminent nominators will be invited to be key participants in the World Technology Summit and simultaneously will be given membership in The World Technology Network Are the World Technology Summit and the World Technology Awards truly historic There has never been a gathering of so many of the leaders of so many technological fields in one place at one time before in history They will be there not because they were paid to be there or because they have to be there but because they have been selected by their peers to honor each other They are gathering to meet the only group of people with whom they do not have to be on the defensive other people equally or more innovative than each of them believe they are themselves Only that level of eliteness can create the intrigue that cuts through the usual and defines the historic What about the World Technology Awards ceremony This years World Technology Awards ceremony will be held in the new Wellcome Wing of the Science Museum immediately adjacent to the World Technology Summit site on the campus of Imperial College The new wing is the largest museum facility in the world devoted to new technologies and its a wonderfully appropriate site to recognise history in the making An interactive exhibit is also being developed which will enable thousands of Museum visitors to vote and comment on Finalists for the World Technology Awards during the week leading up to the Awards on the evening of July nd The physical Awards themselves are also worth noting Richard Meier the worldfamous architect is designing them as contribution to these initiatives Meiers most renowned projects include among many others the Getty Center in Los Angeles the High Museum in Atlanta the Frankfurt Museum for Decorative Arts in Germany Canal Television Headquarters in Paris the City Hall and Central Library in the Hague the Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona and the Church of the Year at the Vatican Whats the Summit agenda The World Technology Summit will feature leading speakers from both technology and industry all the way from the laboratory to the boardroom Mostly drawn of course from the WTN membership The Summit will consist of both plenary meetings and breakout sessions Keynote speakers will provide a visionary overview of the interacting roles of technology and business Session speakers will provide insights into their own particular specialty Panel speakers will intellectually challenge each other in open session And all will contribute to a stimulating debate The World Technology Summit is a gathering where ALL participants are key players with a crucial role to play in the unfolding drama of technology Sessions will focus on a range of goals providing a good grounding in all six of the major emerging tech areas on networking opportunities for participants and on developing new ideas for new businesses new corporate initiatives new partnerships and even new industries A primary feature of the Summit will be a series of concurrent twohour breakout workshops in each of the Award categories These SummitswithintheSummit will be made up of the delegates themselves As each of them are amongst the key leaders globally in their own field simply gathering them in a room creates an important minisummit catalytic in and of itself Another very exciting feature of the Summit will occur just before its conclusion All of the delegates will be assigned to work in small roundtable groups of ten Their charge to create an ideal emerging technology based business for the st Century Each roundtable group will include an assortment of toplevel expertise and will be given a topicfield in which to focus We expect more than a few new lines of businesses joint ventures investment and acquisition strategies and even altered career paths to grow out of what with any ordinary group of people would just be considered a simple exercise All Summit delegates and sponsorspartners will of course receive outlines of all of the new businesses created We also working on organising a plenary session focused on social andor environmental global challenges The potential for substantive social partnership between the WTN membership and organizations active in addressing global problems is enormous We do not intend to waste the opportunity Whether its the plenary sessions the SummitswithintheSummit the new business creation process or of course the ongoing interaction within the Network throughout the year what happens when you bring together the people who are creating the future and who are changing the world Well soon find out
