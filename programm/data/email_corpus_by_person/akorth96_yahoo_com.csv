midlevel governmental functionary with a bad combover who wants to give it away to crack addicts squirting out babies I dont care about appearing compassionate I think playing with toy guns doesnt make you a killer I believe ignoring your kids and giving them Prozac might I think Im doing better than the homeless I dont think being a minority makes you noble or victimized I have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are different weird or make me mad This is my life to live and not necessarily up to others expectations I know what SEX is and there are not varying degrees of it I dont celebrate Kwanzaa But if you want to thats fine just dont feel like everyone else should have to I believe that if you are selling me a Dairy Queen shake a pack of cigarettes or hotel room

one ever died because of something Ozzy Osbourne IceT or Marilyn Manson sang but that doesnt mean I want to listen to that crap from someone elses car when Im stopped at a red light But I respect your right to do so I think that being a student doesnt give you any more enlightenment than working at Blockbuster or Jack In The Box I dont want to eat or drink anything with the words light lite or fatfree on the package Our soldiers did not go to some foreign country and risk their lives in vain and defend our Constitution so that decades later you can tell me its a living document ever changing and is open to interpretation The guys who wrote it were light years ahead of anyone today and they meant what they said now leave the document alone or theres going to be trouble I dont hate the rich I help the poor I know wrestling is fake Ive never owned or was a slave and a large percentage of our forefathers werent wealthy enough to own one either Please stop blaming me because some prior white people were idiots and remember tons of white Indian Chinese and other races have been enslaved too it was wrong for every one of them I believe a selfrighteous liberal with a cause is more dangerous than a Hells Angel with an attitude I want to know exactly which church is it where the Reverend Jessie Jackson preaches and what exactly is his job function I own a gun you can own a

legislation Even suggesting it makes me mad Youre telling me that someone who is a minority gay disabled another nationality or otherwise different from the mainstream of this country has more value as a human being that I do as a white male If someone kills anyone Id say that its a hate crime We dont need more laws Lets enforce the ones we already have I think turkey bacon turkey beef turkey fake anything sucks I believe that it doesnt take a village to raise a child it takes a parent with the guts to stand up to the kid and spank his butt and say NO when its necessary to do so Ill admit that the only movie that ever made me cry was Ole Yeller I didnt realize Dr Seuss was a genius until I had a kid I will not be frowned upon or be looked down upon or be made to keep silent because I have these beliefs and opinions I thought this country allowed me that right I will not conform or compromise just to keep from hurting somebodys feelings Im neither angry nor disenfranchised no
