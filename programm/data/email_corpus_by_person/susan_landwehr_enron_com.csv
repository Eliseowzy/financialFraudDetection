bill would not be called for a vote The customers were unwilling to give anymore on the enviroment issues and the democrats would similarly not back off their positions Mid American then switched gears to pull out all the stops on getting labor support in order to trump the enviro supporters Mid American put forward a proposal to the unionslegislators that they would commit to build power plants in the state of Iowa as opposed to developing in Illinois over the next years that would employ union labor Mid American also had its top management making many visits this weekGreg Abel and I believe also David Sokol No Warren Buffet sightings yetThis offer created a flurry of activity on both sides but at the end of the day Thursday the state IBEW group let it be known that they would still not support the bill even with the Mid Am proposal Mid American believes that the Republicans now have a hook to force the democrats into voting for the de reg bill by saying that if they dont vote affirmative they are not for economic development in the ruralstruggling areas of the state where the power plants would be built WHile I may not share Mid Americans positive assessment the

intervention from Governor Vilsack the democrats will not come around As stated in my earlier message I am not optimistic about passage Tempers are running very high and it is very possible that the

last few days due to the political maneuvering of the Democrats As you will recall the House Republicans have always stated that they needed Democrat votes in order to bring the matter to the floor for a vote Despite Governor Vilsacks stated support for the measure last week as well as last weekend the House Democrat leadership is unwilling to push their members as they want to use this bill against the Republicans in the House races this fall The tactic they will take is that residential rates will rise in the Southeastern part of the state due to the Republicans passing the bill The primary issue that the Dems are using as a reason not to vote for the bill is that the enviromental protectionsfunds are not high enough The Republicans are unhappy about the exhorbitant amount of funds and the RPS that are already in the bill and are not willing to vote for an amended bill that the Dems are pushing for The enviros and the unions are as they have been for the last months the dividing force in this debate Therefore the proponents coalition moved their efforts to the Senate with the hope of getting a vote out this week and then move it back over to the HOuse While we had a good commitment from Senate leadership both Dems and Republicans on Monday that support has eroded as of this morning We are trying a number of tactics and hope that there will be some positive movement today and tomorrow Without the Governor stepping up to the plate and encouraging the democrats to gather the number of democrat votes neccessary this week I am not optimistic about passage There are still twothree weeks of session left so this debate could rage until then but my sense is that if we dont get something out of the Senate by the end of this week or early next week well be dead Call if you have any questions

the Democrats As you will recall the House Republicans have always stated that they needed Democrat votes in order to bring the matter to the floor for a vote Despite Governor Vilsacks stated support for the measure last week as well as last weekend the House Democrat leadership is unwilling to push their members as they want to use this bill against the Republicans in the House races this fall The tactic they will take is that residential rates will rise in the Southeastern part of the state due to the Republicans passing the bill The primary issue that the Dems are using as a reason not to

willing to vote for an amended bill that the Dems are pushing for The enviros and the unions are as they have been for the last months the dividing force in this debate Therefore the proponents

democrat votes guaranteed As is often the case in these debates the proponents continue to try many strategies but all of us agree that without direct intervention from Governor Vilsack the democrats

the Democrats As you will recall the House Republicans have always stated that they needed Democrat votes in order to bring the matter to the floor for a vote Despite Governor Vilsacks stated support for the measure last week as well as last weekend the House Democrat leadership is unwilling to push their members as they want to use this bill against the Republicans in the House races this fall The tactic they will take is that residential rates will rise in the Southeastern part of the state due to the Republicans passing the bill The primary issue that the Dems are using as a reason not to

willing to vote for an amended bill that the Dems are pushing for The enviros and the unions are as they have been for the last months the dividing force in this debate Therefore the proponents coalition moved their efforts to the Senate with the hope of getting a vote out this week and then move it back over to the HOuse While we had a good commitment from Senate leadership both Dems and Republicans on Monday that support has eroded as of this morning We are trying a number of tactics and hope that there will be some positive movement today and tomorrow Without the Governor stepping up to the plate and encouraging the democrats to gather the number of democrat votes neccessary this week I am not optimistic about passage There are still twothree weeks of session left so this

of the power outages a few summers ago The City is looked to across the country as having a stateoftheart plan that encompasses over critical facilities classified with an AC rating Each of these City

Davis trying to spin out of energy crisis Energy advisers have ruthless reputation Davis trying to spin out of energy crisis Energy advisers have ruthless reputation Ken Garcia Saturday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchiveM NNDTL No matter how much you try to spin the facts the truth usually topples out This will explain why Gray Davis is suffering from a reality blackout because no one spins harder or faster than our opaque leader who quite equitably is suffering his own power crisis Why Do You Think They Call Him Gray has an unrelenting blackandwhite problem How can he explain away his indecision in grappling with the energy crisis sooner his inability to hammer out a deal with the utilities and power suppliers before they had the state handcuffed and his frantic response to spend million in public funds to purchase future electricity without offering consumers the details of the pact The truth is he cannot although he has tried mightily And to that end he made one of his biggest mistakes yet no small feat when you consider he is at the center of one of the sharpest economic tailspins in Californias history Rather than tackle the issues headon Davis did what he has always done use consultants and polling data to try and navigate the minefield of public opinion to put himself in the best possible light and blame others for his problems Its a game Bill Clinton perfected but at which the governor is a mere weekend hobbyist Davis decision to hire two former ClintonGore spin doctors to explain away his role in the energy crisis has been as predictable as this summers threat of rolling blackouts If only in this case he could have kept his critics in the dark While the states taxpayers were hit with record electricity bills Davis was pointing his finger at every official in the federal government who might conceivably have played a role in the crisis and especially those power suppliers in the Lone Star state who have been soaking California ratepayers dry It is obviously true that the Bush administration has been reluctant to help the nations most populous state because it voted for Al Gore in November And time will probably show that the power companies in Texas and beyond were being Snopeslike in their dealings with the Golden State But there is no getting around the fact that Davis severely exacerbated Californias energy plight through his own inaction as evidenced by our sweltering soul mates in San Diego who were experiencing blackouts and spiraling electricity costs early last summer Yet why suffer the facts when its so much easier to just scramble them When the energy crisis hit its peak this spring and Davis popularity ratings began shortcircuiting he brought in Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani who had been as ubiquitous in the scandalridden Clinton administration as the stain on a certain interns dress The pair became so adept at parrying the thrusts of truth directed by the press each day that they earned the label masters of disaster which may be why Davis thought of them when he considered the calamity beginning to envelop him If only he had considered the accompanying stink Lehane and Fabiani are considered by the political cognoscenti as nothing less than ruthless partisan hired guns happy to attack anyone standing between them and a monthly paycheck Unfortunately for Davis the rhetorical hit mens salaries are being paid by California taxpayers who are none too happy that they will be socked with billions of dollars in extra energy charges as a result of Davis lack of leadership So although Lehane and Fabianis monthly consulting fees may look paltry to a governor who has contributed to Californias lost billions it looks quite a bit different to those little people in the bleacher seats sometimes known as Californias millionplus residents The hiring of the disaster duo has led to a lawsuit by an antitax group from Sacramento that alleges Lehane and Fabiani are violating the state Political Reform Act because the gunslingers have also worked for Southern California Edison as consultants a generally accepted nono for public officials even those who worked in Washington And State Controller Kathleen Connell a fellow Democrat has rightfully refused to pay state funds for the ClintonGore castoffs because she said it is inconceivable that the two men are working on state policy not politics as required by law Until obfuscation and misdirection become part of the official state code of ethics its fair to say Connell is on pretty firm ground Or as one member of a tax protest group put it We are adding insult to injury to have the governor who feels the pressure of this crisis to spend this kind of dough for damage control Damage control is not supposed to incite more damage but right now Davis is a metal helmet in an electrical storm His arrogant treatment of state voters his refusal to shoulder responsibility and his efforts to spin his way out of trouble has left even diehard Democrats searching for a more palatable replacement That decision will come next year when Davis is up for reelection And the millions of people who chose him because he seemed a safe but dull choice will now realize that there is little solace in gray areas Since the governor is involved it seems apt to call it a cautionary tale But by the time the spin doctors are through it may start to sound more like an urban legend You can reach Ken Garcia at or email him at San Francisco Chronicle Page A

who called Sue MAra to apologize for the Lockyear comment Jeff Dasovich Sent by Jeff Dasovich AM To Richard nron Janel nron Karen NRON James D nron Linda NRON Susan M nron Susan J NRON cc Subject Davis trying to spin out of energy crisis Energy advisers have ruthless reputation Davis trying to spin out of energy crisis Energy advisers have ruthless reputation Ken Garcia Saturday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchiveM NNDTL No matter how much you try to spin the facts the truth usually topples out This will explain why Gray Davis is suffering from a reality blackout because no one spins harder or faster than our opaque leader who quite equitably is suffering his own power crisis Why Do You Think They Call Him Gray has an unrelenting blackandwhite problem How can he explain away his indecision in grappling with the energy crisis sooner his inability to hammer out a deal with the utilities and power suppliers before they had the state handcuffed and his frantic response to spend million in public funds to purchase future electricity without offering consumers the details of the pact The truth is he cannot although he has tried mightily And to that end he made one of his biggest mistakes yet no small feat when you consider he is at the center of one of the sharpest economic tailspins in Californias history Rather than tackle the issues headon Davis did what he has always done use consultants and polling data to try and navigate the minefield of public opinion to put himself in the best possible light and blame others for his problems Its a game Bill Clinton perfected but at which the governor is a mere weekend hobbyist Davis decision to hire two former ClintonGore spin doctors to explain away his role in the energy crisis has been as predictable as this summers threat of rolling blackouts If only in this case he could have kept his critics in the dark While the states taxpayers were hit with record electricity bills Davis was pointing his finger at every official in the federal government who might conceivably have played a role in the crisis and especially those power suppliers in the Lone Star state who have been soaking California ratepayers dry It is obviously true that the Bush administration has been reluctant to help the nations most populous state because it voted for Al Gore in November And time will probably show that the power companies in Texas and beyond were being Snopeslike in their dealings with the Golden State But there is no getting around the fact that Davis severely exacerbated Californias energy plight through his own inaction as evidenced by our sweltering soul mates in San Diego who were experiencing blackouts and spiraling electricity costs early last summer Yet why suffer the facts when its so much easier to just scramble them When the energy crisis hit its peak this spring and Davis popularity ratings began shortcircuiting he brought in Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani who had been as ubiquitous in the scandalridden Clinton administration as the stain on a certain interns dress The pair became so adept at parrying the thrusts of truth directed by the press each day that they earned the label masters of disaster which may be why Davis thought of them when he considered the calamity beginning to envelop him If only he had considered the accompanying stink Lehane and Fabiani are considered by the political cognoscenti as nothing less than ruthless partisan hired guns happy to attack anyone standing between them and a monthly paycheck Unfortunately for Davis the rhetorical hit mens salaries are being paid by California taxpayers who are none too happy that they will be socked with billions of dollars in extra energy charges as a result of Davis lack of leadership So although Lehane and Fabianis monthly consulting fees may look paltry to a governor who has contributed to Californias lost billions it looks quite a bit different to those little people in the bleacher seats sometimes known as Californias millionplus residents The hiring of the disaster duo has led to a lawsuit by an antitax group from Sacramento that alleges Lehane and Fabiani are violating the state Political Reform Act because the gunslingers have also worked for Southern California Edison as consultants a generally accepted nono for public officials even those who worked in Washington And State Controller Kathleen Connell a fellow Democrat has rightfully refused to pay state funds for the ClintonGore castoffs because she said it is inconceivable that the two men are working on state policy not politics as required by law Until obfuscation and misdirection become part of the official state code of ethics its fair to say Connell is on pretty firm ground Or as one member of a tax protest group put it We are adding insult to injury to have the governor who feels the pressure of this crisis to spend this kind of dough for damage control Damage control is not supposed to incite more damage but right now Davis is a metal helmet in an electrical storm His arrogant treatment of state voters his refusal to shoulder responsibility and his efforts to spin his way out of trouble has left even diehard Democrats searching for a more palatable replacement That decision will come next year when Davis is up for reelection And the millions of people who chose him because he seemed a safe but dull choice will now realize that there is little solace in gray areas Since the governor is involved it seems apt to call it a cautionary tale But by the time the spin doctors are through it may start to sound more like an urban legend You can reach Ken Garcia at or email him at San Francisco Chronicle Page A

Davis was in town to review the Citys emergency action plan in the event of massive or rolling blackouts Steve Walter met with him to brief him of the Citys extremely thorough emergency plan which was a result of the power outages a few summers ago The City is looked to across the country as having a stateoftheart plan that encompasses over critical facilities classified with an AC rating Each of these City County or State facitlities had a hookup plate installed on the outside of the building so a portable generator could be moved into place in an emergency The plan also covers procedures planning operations support center set up etc Very comprehensive I suppose Mr Davis may just be thinking ahead Mike PS If the conversation actually did extend into what else the City is doing about electricity and Enrons name also came up I doubt that we would be viewed negatively at all in fact the exact opposite We are part of Daleys plan to lessen his reliance on the terrible utility We are

very well and especially where Mr Lay placed his support during the last election My read on this algnment is that Daley will do what it takes to keep the energy issue from becoming a snow storm type
