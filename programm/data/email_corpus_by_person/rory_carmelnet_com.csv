<24715975.1075843463608.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,rory@carmelnet.com,2001-05-06 04:40:00,another questionJeff Did you get my email last week I really hate the fact that questions of fact are so hard to get answered because nobody seems to be able to answer energy issue questions that arent tinged with political implications It seems to me that certain questions ought to be answerable purely on the basis of simple empirical fact For example in the paper today it says San Diego Gas Electric was the first utility to sell its power plants and under the deregulation law was then freed from the stateimposed rate caps Thus is the problem with PGE that it never sold ALL its plants I know it sold some the one near us Moss Landing is owned by Duke for example So was the sole reason PGE was unable to raise their rates to meet their costs of buying energy the fact that it hadnt sold all its plants If so does that mean say if PGE had kept of its plants and the other of the power it sold it had to buy on the unregulated wholesale market it would have been prevented from raising its rates for of the power it sold or resoldto its customers If so what WAS the percentage of power plants PGE DIDNT sell Did they try to sell these Were they just unable to find any buyers Youd think with the amount of money they claimed to be losing everyday they could have GIVEN those plants away and made money off the deal What is wrong with my understanding here Rory

Tomorrow Redress Grievances Revised by Michael Rectenwald septwoundshtml At this time let us in the the prodemocracy movement give ourselves to the heart of democracy by sharing our best selves with those in pain in need in emergencies and in unfathomable grief Let us focus in the immediate on the spirit the deeper soul and body of our nation to address with loving hearts minds and hands our physical moral and spiritual wounds which wounds are so deep and many tonight We are all suffering tonight but others suffer more than we do Let us help them Let us suspend our grievances for a brief time to focus on the wellbeing of our fellow human beings Whether policies or an implacable history has delivered this day and both have arguably contributed the day is ours and we must gather its bleeding members and wrap ourselves around them as bandages around lacerations Some of us were eyewitnesses to the tragedies of today who had arms legs and parts of people falling on our heads Our nation is poorer our lives are lessened and our hearts are heavy tonight We who love democracy and value the lives of all people equally find ourselves in a difficult predicament find ourselves being asked to rally behind a leader who we know is not our leader a leader who has we believe already inflicted wounds on our nation a leader who has our nations fate in his hands and who has already endangered us Our anger towards what many of us felt was a likely eventuality under Bush unprecedented reprisals from parties hostile to the US and his policies is justified We have warned and warned Bush is dangerous domestically and abroad Now under Bush we have experienced another unprecedented assault on our nation following the first one delivered on Jan the worst act of terrorism to hit the American citizens in the history of the nation We do not think that this attack under Bushs command represents a meaningless coincidence Rather the events are linked part of that inescapable web of mutuality that Martin Luther King referred to There was no escaping it a forcible takeover of the nation would have negative consequences in and for the world The Bush political legacy from GH to GW on down has contributed greatly to the ire directed at our citizens That tensions in the Middle East have been exacerbated by the laissez faire policies of the unilateralist Bush that Clinton was at least moving towards peace while under Bushs nonstewardship the situation has approached anarchy not many in the movement and indeed the world doubt We must in very short order resume our assault on Bushs international policies of unilateralism bellicose posturing and treatybreaking and soon before more casualties occur as a result But at the present moment and I mean in the very immediate moment let us address a deeper sense of democracy the right of life liberty and the peaceable pursuit of happiness of all peoples by taking care of immediate needs Lets tend to the immediate sense of morality loyalty and commitment to those nearest us Therefore for the brief duration of our imperilment lets show some restraint with a foreknowledge of our greater purpose in our outrage at the ships captain and hope and work for the safe delivery of the ship Accusing Bush of deliberately causing the terrorism for example will not help either the nation or our movement it will hurt those in pain and alienate those who might otherwise concur with us However when delivered from this hopefully short excursus into Hell after reaching relatively safe harbor we can resume our work to oust the illegitimate captain Our commitment to the cause will have been no less rather it will take on a deeper significance We will have purified ourselves to a degree and will then be more fit for direct action We will make sure our hearts are in the right place that we have always only had the wellbeing and best interests of our nation at heart Let us then attend to our own and care for the nation displaying our own deeper sense of patriotism one that loves our nation and people too much to contribute to bellicose international posturing and that also cares too much to neglect our direct duties

difficult person to locate sometimes Ill let you know when I get a response Rory Sellers Original Message From Dasovich Jeff To Avram Siegel Sent Tuesday November PM Subject RE Online Computer Component Info Suffice to say Avram youve explained it a helluvalot better than I did I think I got as far as he wants to build a computerbased digital recording extravaganza Anyway Im responding because you replied only to me instead of reply to all Rory Eldon heres the dope I can hardly wait to hear the response Best to all Jeff Original Message From Avram Siegel Sent Tue PM To Dasovich Jeff Cc Subject Re Online Computer Component Info Hey Jeff Thanks for getting the word out there and hi to everyone checking in So heres the deal I want to build a DAW digital audio workstation a computer for multitrack audio recording and mixing etc Ive been researching this for a while but have just gotten more serious about it in the last couple of weeks partly because I lucked into a nice piece of hardware indefinate loan from a friend An to channel interface called a Delta which gives me a nice head start From what I have read so far it seems that there are some specific requirements for a machine to be solid and reliable It needs to be fast not so hard these days but the faster the better within my budget It needs to be paired down anything running in the background like powermanagement schemes can cause pops and clicks while youre recording and extraneous hareware uses system resources And it should have a seperate fast and large hard drive just for the audio data typically a SCSI drive Im finding a lot of recomendations against buying something off the shelf like a Dell or whatever Mostly I think to have more control over the specific components and also to cut down on a lot of the unnecessary to audio recording integrated accessories that those computers tend to have Also Im kind of looking forward to building it myself I like that kind of thing and it would mean I know how the thing works Heres the plan Im formulating at this point Im thinking of putting together a dual processor system with the fastest pentium IIIs I can afford There doesnt seem to be all that big a price range between the different speeds just now probably because theyre yesterdays news with the Ps out there By the way the Pentium s have not been getting the best reviews in the audio world from what I can tell and I dont think theres a dual processor motherboard for them yet Also I think they are more expensive For this I need to come up with a motherboard The one that Ive come up with so far is an Asus Tek CUVXD but Im new to all this and I dont even know what I dont know as far as whats out there so any suggestions are welcome Also I know I need a fast SCSI ideally rpm or better data trasnsfer rate of MB per second sustained transfer rate of at least MB per second or better and a seek time of ms or less as quoted in one of my sources Of course I need a pile of memory but I understand that its pretty cheap right now There also seems to be a debate going on about AMDs CPUs these days Hopefully I can save some money going low end on stuff like the monitor the keyboard and anything else that doesnt directly pertain to audio recording because I actually am on a budget Maybe there are some elements that I can even save for an upgrade I am willing to spend what I need to though because if this works well it could make for a more affordable way to record True Blues upcoming cd than going into a regular studio So there you have it in a rambling kind of way I appreciate any info you all can offer For instance I really dont know what the cheapest source for all this stuff is and there are probably plenty of issues that Im totally ignorant of Clearly all this points to the old saying about a little knowledge being a dangerous thing Avram Original Message From Dasovich Jeff mailto To Dasovich Jeff mailto Avram Siegel mailto eldon sellers

longtime stance against humans killing each other Monday Above God Look I dont know maybe I havent made myself completely clear so for the record here it is again said the Lord His divine face betraying visible emotion during a press conference near the site of the fallen Twin Towers Somehow people keep coming up with the idea that I want them to kill their neighbor Well I dont And to be honest Im really getting sick and tired of it Get it straight Not only do I not want anybody to kill anyone but I specifically commanded you not to in really simple terms that anybody ought to be able

Talking To Your Child About The WTC Attack oniontalkingtoyourchildtipshtml On TV Tonight onionontvtonighthtml Worshipped by Christians Jews and Muslims alike God said His name has been invoked countless times over the centuries as a reason to kill in what He called an unending cycle of violence I dont care how holy somebody claims to be God said If a person tells you its My will that they kill someone theyre wrong Got it I dont care what religion you are or who you think your enemy is here it is one more time No killing in My name or anyone elses ever again The press conference came as a surprise to humankind as God rarely intervenes in earthly affairs As a matter of longstanding policy He has traditionally left the task of interpreting His message and divine will to clerics rabbis priests imams and Biblical scholars Theologians and laymen alike have been given the task of pondering His ineffable mysteries deciding for themselves what to do as a matter of faith His decision to manifest on the material plane was motivated by the deep sense of shock outrage and sorrow He felt over the Sept violence carried out in His name and over its dire potential ramifications around the globe I tried to put it in the simplest possible terms for you people so youd get it straight because I thought it was pretty important said God called Yahweh and Allah respectively in the Judaic and Muslim traditions I guess I figured Id left no real room for confusion after putting it in a fourword sentence with onesyllable words on the tablets I gave to Moses How much more clear can I get But somehow it all gets twisted around and next thing you know somebodys spouting off some nonsense about God says I have to kill this guy God wants me to kill that guy its Gods will God continued Its not Gods will all right News flash Gods will equals Dont murder people Worse yet many of the worst violators claim that their actions are justified by passages in the Bible Torah and Quran To be honest theres some contradictory stuff in there okay God said So I can see how it could be pretty misleading I admit itMy bad I did My best to inspire them but a lot of imperfect human agents have misinterpreted My message over the millennia Frankly much of the material that got in there is dogmatic doctrinal bullshit I turn My head for a second and suddenly all this stuff about homosexuality gets into Leviticus and everybody thinks its Gods will to kill gays It absolutely drives Me up the wall God praised the overwhelming majority of His Muslim followers as wonderful pious people calling the perpetrators of the Sept attacks rare exceptions This whole medieval concept of the jihad or holy war had all but vanished from the Muslim world in like the th century and with good reason God said Theres no such thing as a holy war only unholy ones The vast majority of Muslims in this world reject the murderous actions of these radical extremists just like the vast majority of Christians in America are pissed off over those two bigots on The Club Continued God Read the book Allah is kind Allah is beautiful Allah is merciful It goes on and on that way page after page But no some assholes have to come along and revive this stupid holywar crap just to further their own hateful agenda So now everybody thinks Muslims are all murderous barbarians Thanks Taliban years of panIslamic cultural progress down the drain God stressed that His remarks were not directed exclusively at Islamic extremists but rather at anyone whose ideological zealotry overrides his or her ability to comprehend the core message of all world religions I dont care what faith you are everybodys been making this same mistake since the dawn of time God said The Muslims massacre the Hindus the Hindus massacre the Muslims The Buddhists everybody massacres the Buddhists The Jews dont even get me started on the hardline rightwing Meir Kahaneloving Israeli nationalists man And the Christians You people believe in a Messiah who says Turn the other cheek but youve been killing everybody you can get your hands on since the Crusades Growing increasingly wrathful God continued Cant you people see What are you morons There are a ton of different religious traditions out there and different cultures worship Me in different ways But the basic message is always the same Christianity Islam Judaism Buddhism Shintoism every religious belief system under the sun they all say youre supposed to love your neighbors folks Its not that hard a concept to grasp Why would you think Id want anything else Humans dont need religion or God as an excuse to kill each otheryouve been doing that without any help from Me since you were freaking apes God said The whole point of believing in God is to have a higher standard of behavior How obvious can you get Im talking to all of you here continued God His voice rising to a shout Do you hear Me I dont want you to kill anybody Im against it across the board How many times do I have to say it Dont kill each other anymoreever Im fucking serious Upon completing His outburst God fell silent standing quietly at the podium for several moments Then

the first few words of their expression identifies them as similarly conservative It is a pity WSJ wasnt quoting Scott Simon when he was exhorting college students to work for peace I perceive a lot of closeminded thinking disguised these days as being beyond politics Bill OReillys slogan fair and balanced as always makes me gag That the Right has turned our national tragedy into an opportunity to gain political ground then deflects criticism as being inappropriately political is the height of hypocrisy but is more and more becoming a touchstone for conservatism in this country Yes Simon normally espouses liberal views But when people lose their values it doesnt therefore mean those values were bankrupt David Horowitz was a member of the Weather underground during the antiVietnam war protests Now he writes that the blood of American soldiers is on the hands of peace activists and articles like The sick mind of Noam Chomsky People change Thats probably good But the mere fact that someone can move from peach activism to war mongering though doesnt necessarily imply evolutionary thinking And reactionary zealots call talkshows everyday lying that they used to be a Clinton Democrat or a liberal until this or that terrible thing occurred recently that finally opened their eyes I could not disagree more with Simon and anyone else who believes we are doing the right thing to bomb Afghanistan then demonizes any criticism as showing support for terror Sure it makes me feel good that we might be hurting those who committed the barbarism on September I would support this war if I thought it would bring about greater justice in the world and greater security for America Of course yes then it WOULD be justified To paint all those who suggest this war is a mistake as wanting to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon would make and to equate whats happening now to the s is infantile strawmanism Why did we invade Kuwait Was it to preserve democracy I dont think so Why are our troops still in Saudi Arabia Is it to preserve justice and freedom I dont think so What was the Great Game in Afghanistan Why is it being replayed Is it to support the fair distribution of wealth It doesnt look like it to me There is too much going on here involving oil and economics and too little involving justice and democracy And who can sincerely believe the best way to prevent the further innocent loss of life is to bomb Afghanistan Wouldnt it be a lot better to cut off our billion in aid to Israel until they found a way to live peacefully in Palestine Ive studied the history I dont find Israel significantly more appealing than the Palestinians What right have we got to be so onesided in our support in that conflict Israel chided us last week with appeasing the terrorists while we waited to launch our counterattack I do not support bombing Afghanistan and continuing to send money to Israel instead of INSISTING that conflict be resolved NOW We need to find the people responsible for the attacks and either hospitalize them in isolated padded cells or string them up by their private parts Im no pacifist in that department But we need even more to show millions of poorly educated Muslims Arabs and others that we are a force for good in the world We need to reach out to our brothers and sisters all over the third world and show them that America really believes in justice and freedom and democracy A billion souls live on a dollar a day Another billion live on two dollars a day We you and I were fortunate to have been born here and not there But if the tables had been turned and we HAD been born there how would we want America wealthy and wasteful beyond comprehension to act Perhaps to lend a hand There is a lot of evidence that the World Bank and the IMF are not making things better for debtor nations Can we forgive ourselves for not helping This question was relevant on Sept Its relevant now Yes we were unjustly attacked by madmen They must be found and stopped Do you really think bombing Afghanistan is a very high priority if our goal is to make the world a safer and better place for all people I think that like it or not we are at a stage where to make our own lives safer more productive and more comfortable we have to find a way to make the lives of all people safer more productive and more comfortable We are not doing that This war is not promoting that What are we really gaining by this war that we couldnt gain by holding back the bombs And what are we losing by dropping the bombs that we may have a terrible time regaining Rory Original Message From Dasovich Jeff To Cameron Sellers Email Nancy Sellers Email Prentice Sellers Email Rory Sellers Email Scott

credentialed lib and Quakeron just wars Sort of thoughtprovoking Best Jeff October Commentary Even Pacifists Must Support This War By Scott Simon the host of National Public Radios Weekend Edition With Scott Simon Pacifists often commit the same mistake as generals They prepare for the last war not the next one Many of the peace activists I have seen trying to rouse opposition to todays war against terrorism remind me of a Halloween parade They put on old familiarlooking protest masks against American imperialism oppression and violence that bear no resemblance to the real demons haunting us now Pacifism has never been exactly popular But when I became a Quaker as an adolescent in the late s pacifism seemed to offer a compelling alternative to the perpetuity of brute force Mahatma Gandhi had overthrown an empire and Martin Luther King had overturned a racial tyranny with nonviolent marches fasts and boycotts that were nervy ennobling and effective Pacifism seemed to offer a chance for survival to a generation that had been stunted by the fear of nuclear extinction I worked as a war reporter but I never saw a conflict between this and being a Quaker If my reporting was sometimes drawn more to human details than to the boxscore kind of war coverage those details struck me as critical to explaining war I never covered a conflict whether in Central America the Caribbean Africa or the Middle East that seriously shook my religious convictions In fact most conflicts seemed to prove how war was rotten wasteful and useless El Salvadors civil war killed people over nine years It was hard to see how the political compromise that ended the conflict could not have been reached after just six months But in the s I covered the Balkans In Sarajevo Srebrenica and Kosovo I confronted the logical flaw or perhaps I should say the fatal flaw of nonviolent resistance All the best people can be killed by all the worst ones I had never believed that pacifism had all the answers neither does militarism About half of all draft age Quakers enlisted in World War II believing that whatever wisdom pacifism had to give the world it could not defeat the murderous schemes of Adolf Hitler and his cohorts It seems to me that in confronting the forces that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon American pacifists have no sane alternative now but to support war I dont consider this reprisal or revenge but selfdefense protecting the world from further attacks by destroying those who would launch them Some peace activists their judgment still hobbled by shock seem to believe that the attacks against New York and Washington were natural disasters terrible unpredictable whirlwinds that struck once and will not reoccur This is wrong We know now that there has been an ongoing violent campaign aimed at bringing down diverse nations with none being more gloriously speckled than the US People who try to hold certain American policies or culture responsible are trying to decorate the crimes of psychotics with synthetic political significance In the Oxford Student Union conducted a famous debate over whether it was moral for Britons to fight for king and country The exquisite intellects of that leading university reviewed the many ways in which British colonialism exploited and oppressed the world They cited the ways in which vengeful demands made of Germany in the wake of World War I had helped to kindle nationalism and fascism They saw no moral difference between Western colonialism and world fascism The Oxford Union ended that debate with this famous proclamation Resolved that we will in no circumstances fight for king and country Von Ribbentrop sent back the good news to Germanys new chancellor Hitler The West will not fight for its own survival Its finest minds will justify a silent surrender In short the besteducated young people of their time could not tell the difference between the deficiencies of their own nation in which liberty and democracy were cornerstones and a dictatorship founded on racism tyranny and fear And what price would those who urge reconciliation today pay for peace Should Americans impose a unitary religious state throw women out of school and work and rob other religious groups of their rights so that we have the kind of society the attackers accept Do pacifists really want to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon would make Pacifists do not need any lectures about risking their lives to stop wickedness Quakers resisted slavery by smuggling out slaves when even Abraham Lincoln tried to appease the Confederacy Pacifists sneaked refugee Jews out of Germany when England and the US were still trying to placate Hitler Many conscientious objectors have served bravely in gritty and unglamorous tasks that aided the US in time of war But those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to risk their lives to defend our dissent The war against terrorism does not shove American power into places where it has no place It calls on Americas military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions are not apparent Only American and British power can stop more killing in the worlds skyscrapers pizza parlors embassies bus stations ships and airplanes Pacifists like most Americans would like to change their country in a thousand ways And the blasts of Sept should remind American pacifists that they live in that one place on the planet where change in fact peaceful change seems most possible It is better to sacrifice our ideals than to expect others to die for them Original Message From eldon
