luminaries ranging from Fidel Castro to Gerald Ford to Dr Ruth Sometimes the speeches have generated a bit of media coverage sometimes not But one given last month by Charlton Heston has taken on a life of its own Heston the actor and conservative activist delivered a stemwinder to about listeners about a cultural war thats about to hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart He knew he was coming to a liberal environment and clearly a group of his listeners was conservative and another was more liberal said David Christopherson president of the forum About half respectfully challenged him during the questions It generated a lot of debate around the campus But what happened caught us offguard What happened was Rush Limbaughs radio talk show On March Limbaugh read the entire speech on the air only to find himself bombarded with thousands of requests for a copy of it The same thing happened at Harvard Law We couldnt keep up with all the requests said Mike Chmura at Harvard It really didnt have legs and might have been forgotten if Mr Limbaugh hadnt decided to deliver it Winning the Cultural War Charlton Hestons Speech to the Harvard Law School Forum Feb I remember my son when he was five explaining to his kindergarten class what his father did for a living My Daddy he said pretends to be people There have been quite a few of them Prophets from the Old and New Testaments a couple of Christian saints generals of various nationalities and different centuries several kings three American presidents a French cardinal and two geniuses including Michelangelo As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me If my Creator gave me the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those great men then I want to use that same gift now to reconnect you with your own sense of liberty of your own freedom of thought your own compass for what is right Dedicating the memorial at Gettysburg Abraham Lincoln said of America We are now engaged in a great Civil War testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure Those words are true again I believe that we are again engaged in a great civil war a cultural war thats about to hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside youthe stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into the miracle that it is Let me back up About a year ago I became president of the National Rifle Association which protects the right to keep and bear arms I ran for office I was elected and now I serveI serve as a moving target for the media whove called me everything from ridiculous and duped to a raininjured senile crazy old man I knowIm pretty oldbut I sure Lord aint senile As I have stood in the crosshairs of those who target Second Amendment freedoms Ive realized that firearms are not the only issue No its much much bigger than that Ive come to understand that a cultural war is raging across our land in which with Orwellian fervor certain acceptable thoughts and speech are mandated For example I marched for civil rights with Dr King in long before Hollywood found it fashionable But when I told an audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride or red pride or anyone elses pride they called me a racist Ive worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life But when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no further than your rights or my rights I was called a homophobe I served in World War II against the Axis powers But during a speech when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews and singling out innocent gun owners I was called an antiSemite Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my country But when I asked an audience to oppose this cultural persecution I was compared to Timothy McVeigh From Time magazine to friends and colleagues theyre essentially saying Chuck how dare you speak your mind You are using language not authorized for public consumption But I am not afraid If Americans believed in political correctness wed still be King Georges boyssubjects bound to the British crown In his book The End of Sanity Martin Gross writes that blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the norm in almost every area of human endeavor There seem to be new customs new rules new antiintellectual theories regularly foisted on us from every direction Underneath the nation is broiling Americans know something without a name is undermining the nation turning the mind mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right from wrong And they dont like it Let me read a few examples At Antioch college in Ohio young men seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive In New Jersey despite the death of several patients nationwide who had been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS the state commissioner announced that health providers who are HIVpositive need not need not tell their patients that they are infected At William and Mary students tried to change the name of the school team The Tribe because it was supposedly insulting to local Indians only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs truly like the name In San Francisco city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the rights of transvestites to crossdress on the job and for transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing sex change surgery In New York City kids who dont speak a word of Spanish have been placed in bilingual classes to learn their three Rs in Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic At the University of Pennsylvania in a state where thousands died at Gettysburg opposing slavery the president of that college officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students Yeah I know thats out of bounds now Dr King said Negroes Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said black But its a nono now For me hyphenated identities are awkward particularly NativeAmerican Im a Native American for Gods sake I also happen to be a bloodinitiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux On my wifes side my grandson is a thirteenth generation Native American with a capital letter on American Finally just last month David Howard head of the Washington DC Office of Public Advocate used the word niggardly while talking to colleagues about budgetary matters Of course niggardly means stingy or scanty But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and resign As columnist Tony Snow wrote David Howard got fired because some people in public employ were morons who a didnt know the meaning of niggardly b didnt know how to use a dictionary to discover the meaning and c actually demanded that he apologize for their ignorance What does all of this mean It means that telling us what to think has evolved into telling us what to say so telling us what to do cant be far behind Before you claim to be a champion of free thought tell me Why did political correctness originate on Americas campuses And why do you continue to tolerate it Why do you whore supposed to debate ideas surrender to their suppression Lets be honest Who here thinks your professors can say what they really believe It scares me to death and should scare you too that the superstition of political correctness rules the halls of reason You are the best and the brightest You here in the fertile cradle of American academia here in the castle of learning on the Charles River you are the cream But I submit that you and your counterparts across the land are the most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge And as long as you validate thatand abide it you are by your grandfathers standards cowards Heres another example Right now at more than one major university Second Amendment scholars and researchers are being told to shut up about their findings or theyll lose their jobs Why Because their research findings would undermine bigcity mayors pending lawsuits that seeks to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers I dont care what you think about guns But if you are not shocked at that am shocked at you Who will guard the raw material of unfettered ideas if not you Who will defend the core value of academia if you supposed soldiers of free thought and expression lay down your arms and plead Dont shoot me If you talk about race it does not make you a racist If you see distinctions between the genders it does not make you a sexist If you think critically about a denomination it does not make you antireligion If you accept but dont celebrate homosexuality it does not make you a homophobe Dont let Americas universities continue to serve as incubators for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism But what can you do How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation The answers been here all along I learned it years ago on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC standing with Dr Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand people You simply disobey Peaceably yes Respectfully of course Nonviolently absolutely But when told how to think or what to say or how to behave we dont We disobey social protocol that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr King who learned it from Gandhi and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great man who led those in the right against those with the might Disobedience is in our DNA We feel innate kinship with that disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor that sent Thoreau to jail that refused to sit in the back of the bus that protested a war in Viet Nam In that same spirit I am asking you to disavow cultural correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority social directives and onerous laws that weaken personal freedom But be careful it hurts Disobedience demands that you put yourself at risk Dr King stood on lots of balconies You must be willing to be humiliated to endure the modernday equivalent of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water cannons at Selma You must be willing to experience discomfort Im not complaining but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me Let me tell you a story A few years back I heard about a rapper named IceT who was selling a CD called Cop Killer celebrating ambushing and murdering police officers It was being marketed by none other than TimeWarner the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world Police across the country were outraged Rightfully soat least one had been murdered But TimeWarner was stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them and the media were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black I heard TimeWarner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly Hills I owned some shares at the time so I decided to attend What I did there was against the advice of my family and colleagues I asked for the floor To a hushed room of a thousand average American stockholders I simply read the full lyrics of Cop Killer every vicious vulgar instructional word I GOT MY GAUGE SAWED OFF I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF IM ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF IM ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF It got worse a lot worse I wont read the rest of it to you But trust me the room was a sea of shocked frozen blanched faces The TimeWarner executives squirmed in their chairs and stared at their shoes They hated me for that Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist filth where IceT fantasizes about sodomizing two year old nieces of Al and Tipper Gore SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY Well I wont do to you here what I did to them Lets just say I left the room in echoing silence When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps one of them said We cant print that I know I replied but TimeWarners selling it Two months later TimeWarner terminated IceTs contract Ill never be offered another film by Warners or get a good review from Time magazine But disobedience means you must be willing to act not just talk When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself jam the switchboard of the district attorneys office When your university is pressured to lower standards until of the students graduate with honors choke the halls of the board of regents When an yearold boy pecks a girls cheek on the playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment march on that school and block its doorways When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays you petition them oust them banish them When Time magazines cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged crazy Christians holding a cross as it did last month boycott their magazine and the products it advertises So that this nation may long endure I urge you to follow in the hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that freed exiles founded religions defeated tyrants and yes in the hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men by Gods grace built this country If Dr King were here I think he would agree mailto
