structured for GRM Marketing Origination Model For GRM our success is entirely dependent on a developing a team of dedicated marketers who specialize in delivering insurance risk management solutions to clients The business model is a risk aggregation play gathering first loss and coshare pieces of insurable risks we understand We risk impairing our ability to create a portfolio of risks that can be managed repackaged and placed in the capital or insurance markets at large if we dont have direct influence over the deal flow being generated To accomplish this my ideal marketingorigination model working with other Enron business units would be Client Originator Centralized in a long term origination team in ENA EGM EIM as opposed to midmarket function with industry specific expertise eg oil gas power coal forest products etc The CO would be responsible for maximizing client profitability for Enron in an investment banking capacity making sure we have an inside track to the clients strategic initiativesbusiness opportunities and making sure we package complete solutions using all ENE product areas The CO also needs a financial incentive see below to take responsibility for making sure each individual product area is servicing the client where possible particularly when a package solution is not viable eg like outsourcing The CO should be involved with all product marketing calls if possible but would not act as gate keeper rather act more as a control valve creating a steady flow of ideas products and services to the client Product Marketer Centralized in a product marketing team with industry knowledge and product specific expertise While the PM will call on clients for independent origination of new business opportunities ideally the bulk of the opportunities should be marketing to clients identified by the CM to have a need for GRMs products or services The marketing is done in partnership with the CO but the driver of the transaction would be the PM Execution would be handle by the PMs business unit with a portion of revenues devoted to the CO for their origination of the opportunity However if a particular group or CO does not play ball or does not generate any business leads the PM would still be free to originate business independently Shared Resources Centralized in a group like Fundamentals Research Weather Desk etc Especially useful in upstream where the deals require extensive engineering work and technical support We currently use Walt Hamilton Senior Reserve Engineer who works for Craig Fox in Enron Capital Resources not fulltime but nearly full time Once we have a few deals booked an engineer will also need to maintain the position by reviewing the reserves on a regular basis I would envision having Walt on our payroll working for us but remaining part of a resource pool that could be shared depending on deal flow and priorities set by Craig Shared PL Tough to implement but unless there is a real financial incentive COs will naturally focus on deals they originate and the earnings stay in their group Ive worked with splits ranging from if we do all the work and it is a simple referral to if the transaction opportunity is further developed by the time we get involved typically as part of a structured package solution This is best case but in case youre wondering I havent lost my senses Enron is not currently the ideal company to take this approach and I dont believe GRM is the ideal guinea pig to make the change Some hybrid solution is probably better for us tailoring the effort based on the particular group we work with In the case of EGM business units I think this is the way to go since we can influence our own people In the case of ENA or other Enron companies we need to be more selective with the worst case being we go it alone and duplicate efforts This is the path were on today with ECRs upstream business however it is not how we are proceeding with EIM where we are trying to build bridges with forest products and steel or ENAs power desk where we have the double trigger product for them to market Soap Box A little background and my general view of marketing at Enron after nearly years here In my banking career Ive worked both as a relationship manager marketing all the banks product areas to a targeted client base as well as a product specialist working with a relationship manager to service that client base and execute product specific business Our competitors whether investment banks or commercial banks seemed to have a similar setup although they varied in design from broad geographical marketing assignments to industry specific assignments For me this type of marketing and origination setup was easy to leverage meaning my product specialist teams could hire the best and remain small and efficient Enron is the first company Ive worked for that doesnt have a coordinated origination and marketing approach to clients Instead the culture here is clearly based on free access to all clients ie no gate keepers no ownership of the client and hence no one individual accountable for maximizing the profitability of business closed with a client Several different producttrading areas can all call on the same client with little or no coordination and have no game plan to maximize profitability A clear benefit of not having relationship managers is speed to market with new products and new ideas combined with specialist knowledge about the product or service being sold In fact I believe this has been a direct contributor to our ranking as the most innovative company in America A clear drawback is duplication of effort and weak implementation of crosssellinggiven lipservice by most marketing and origination teams I have worked with Nevertheless given Enrons successful track record it appears the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and it is a system Ive comfortably adjusted to Enough of the soap box Just wanted to share my general Enron marketing thoughts and a little of my bias I dont know if this was specific enough for you so let me know if you need more detail Consider this part of a dialogue New Name Im also exploring alternative names for the group that identify our role more readily What do you think of the name Insurance Risk Management Group or Insurance Risk Management Solutions The latter ties into Enrons new way of describing its business activitiesLogistical Solutions I met with Dennis Vegas to discuss branding and general marketing of our activities and he said Logistical Solutions will be in our annual report and a major theme going forward Hope you had a nice holiday Speak to you next week Per

structured for GRM Marketing Origination Model For GRM our success is entirely dependent on a developing a team of dedicated marketers who specialize in delivering insurance risk management solutions to clients The business model is a risk aggregation play gathering first loss and coshare pieces of insurable risks we understand We risk impairing our ability to create a portfolio of risks that can be managed repackaged and placed in the capital or insurance markets at large if we dont have direct influence over the deal flow being generated To accomplish this my ideal marketingorigination model working with other Enron business units would be Client Originator Centralized in a long term origination team in ENA EGM EIM as opposed to midmarket function with industry specific expertise eg oil gas power coal forest products etc The CO would be responsible for maximizing client profitability for Enron in an investment banking capacity making sure we have an inside track to the clients strategic initiativesbusiness opportunities and making sure we package complete solutions using all ENE product areas The CO also needs a financial incentive see below to take responsibility for making sure each individual product area is servicing the client where possible particularly when a package solution is not viable eg like outsourcing The CO should be involved with all product marketing calls if possible but would not act as gate keeper rather act more as a control valve creating a steady flow of ideas products and services to the client Product Marketer Centralized in a product marketing team with industry knowledge and product specific expertise While the PM will call on clients for independent origination of new business opportunities ideally the bulk of the opportunities should be marketing to clients identified by the CM to have a need for GRMs products or services The marketing is done in partnership with the CO but the driver of the transaction would be the PM Execution would be handle by the PMs business unit with a portion of revenues devoted to the CO for their origination of the opportunity However if a particular group or CO does not play ball or does not generate any business leads the PM would still be free to originate business independently Shared Resources Centralized in a group like Fundamentals Research Weather Desk etc Especially useful in upstream where the deals require extensive engineering work and technical support We currently use Walt Hamilton Senior Reserve Engineer who works for Craig Fox in Enron Capital Resources not fulltime but nearly full time Once we have a few deals booked an engineer will also need to maintain the position by reviewing the reserves on a regular basis I would envision having Walt on our payroll working for us but remaining part of a resource pool that could be shared depending on deal flow and priorities set by Craig Shared PL Tough to implement but unless there is a real financial incentive COs will naturally focus on deals they originate and the earnings stay in their group Ive worked with splits ranging from if we do all the work and it is a simple referral to if the transaction opportunity is further developed by the time we get involved typically as part of a structured package solution This is best case but in case youre wondering I havent lost my senses Enron is not currently the ideal company to take this approach and I dont believe GRM is the ideal guinea pig to make the change Some hybrid solution is probably better for us tailoring the effort based on the particular group we work with In the case of EGM business units I think this is the way to go since we can influence our own people In the case of ENA or other Enron companies we need to be more selective with the worst case being we go it alone and duplicate efforts This is the path were on today with ECRs upstream business however it is not how we are proceeding with EIM where we are trying to build bridges with forest products and steel or ENAs power desk where we have the double trigger product for them to market Soap Box A little background and my general view of marketing at Enron after nearly years here In my banking career Ive worked both as a relationship manager marketing all the banks product areas to a targeted client base as well as a product specialist working with a relationship manager to service that client base and execute product specific business Our competitors whether investment banks or commercial banks seemed to have a similar setup although they varied in design from broad geographical marketing assignments to industry specific assignments For me this type of marketing and origination setup was easy to leverage meaning my product specialist teams could hire the best and remain small and efficient Enron is the first company Ive worked for that doesnt have a coordinated origination and marketing approach to clients Instead the culture here is clearly based on free access to all clients ie no gate keepers no ownership of the client and hence no one individual accountable for maximizing the profitability of business closed with a client Several different producttrading areas can all call on the same client with little or no coordination and have no game plan to maximize profitability A clear benefit of not having relationship managers is speed to market with new products and new ideas combined with specialist knowledge about the product or service being sold In fact I believe this has been a direct contributor to our ranking as the most innovative company in America A clear drawback is duplication of effort and weak implementation of crosssellinggiven lipservice by most marketing and origination teams I have worked with Nevertheless given Enrons successful track record it appears the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and it is a system Ive comfortably adjusted to Enough of the soap box Just wanted to share my general Enron marketing thoughts and a little of my bias I dont know if this was specific enough for you so let me know if you need more detail Consider this part of a dialogue New Name Im also exploring alternative names for the group that identify our role more readily What do you think of the name Insurance Risk Management Group or Insurance Risk Management Solutions The latter ties into

your time to read I met with Brent to maker sure he was fully informed of our plans to recognize revenue connected with Jim Bouillions Corporate Risk Management activities Brent agrees with all of the below and I am proceeding with booking each deal for Q as described It means a plus to gross margin in MPR of just under million for Q This does not include the double trigger or any value from Doug Jones muni deal if it comes off this quarter In addition Ill be taking a negative charge reduction in expense for the quarter of just over million recooping all of our peaker expenses plus a little of our own direct time and expense Any questions please give me a call and Id be happy to go into more detail Per Original Message From Sekse Per Sent Tuesday October AM To Price Brent A Cc Williams Karin Bouillion James L Davis Jonathan Sekse Per Subject Accounting of Portfolio Management Revenue for Insurance Risk Markets activities Brent I thought it would be helpful to supply some background for our meeting today at PM My objective is to make sure you are fully up to speed on what we are doing the accounting treatment we are using and Corps position on it all A little background Since January I have been working with Jim Bouillions Corporate Risk Management team to create trading revenue through the proactive management of our corporate insurance needs what we are now calling Portfolio Management Revenue and booking to the MPR Two examples of this which we pushed through in the Q follow below A transaction booked trading our political risk insurance book for total value of Received risk sharing premium by modifying deductible stop loss limits coverage diversification and country diversification covered under OPIC and with our commercial coverage and risk retention in our Vermont captive PL Reported Reported MPR B transaction booked for Hainan China for total value of Cancelled original stand alone insurance policy with limited currency convertibility coverage and reissued coverage through Enron Re for lower premium saving business unit and better coverage Reinsured Enron Re through commercial program and netted PL Reported Reported MPR For the Q we have a number of similar transactions going through The fundamental business change Im trying to implement is to have each Enron business unit pay market prices for their insurance cover leaving IRMs Corporate Risk Management team the incentive to capture insurance risk trading revenues by dynamically managing the risk on an aggregated basis Historically any work Jims team did was considered expense reduction and was simply refunded to Corp or directly to the business units I consider this risk management activity to be no different than any commodity trading book at Enron where the risk manager trader keeps the value they create by trading efficiently in the market Our market just happens to be insurance and our bidoffer spread is the difference between insurance and reinsurance premiums These transactions are an effort to test the concept and push the system The transactions we expect to push through in Q are C transaction to be booked as the second instalment of A above The OPIC risk sharing premium was split into two payments over Q and Q To be reported to MPR D transaction to be booked in our property insurance book It is connected with EESs acquisition of Limbach The market price for their insurance coverage is which is being charged to them By placing the property asset physical damage coverage in the property program we get automatic coverage for new acquisitions up to certain values The insurance market only charges when significant values are added or if the asset acquired is of a different nature than the mix already in the portfolio for example the paper mill acquisitions have generated a charge To be reported to MPR E transaction to be booked capturing the value of our property coverage with Aegis and Energy Insurance Mutual The insurance coverage essentially has a dividend option built into it based on Aegiss or EIMs overall loss experience during the year These dividends are like going long options on loss experience and were captured by Corporate Risk Managements selection of dividend generating markets to write the coverage AEGIS also writes one of the broadest policy forms in the market and is very competitive on price To be reported to MPR In addition there is transaction related to the sale of ENA assets the Peakers which normally would not have resulted in a property insurance refund Jims team negotiated with the underwriters and won a concession to recognize a reduction in premium midway through the year The property program is an umbrella facility which gives us flexibility to move assets in and out of the program subject to the total value of the property and classification hence the income recognized in D We couldnt come up with a good defence for why this should be treated as revenue so we decided to take it in as a negative expense and avoid possible questions down the road The total value well credit to expenses will be approx million In addition our group had over of peaker transaction expenses that we were not reimbursed for when the insurance market transaction we were pursuing had to be cancelled after the sale of the assets Karen has had a number of conversations with the Enron Corp acctg group They do not have issues with the portfolio mgmt revenue as it is still below their materiality scope somewhere around million Hope this helps set the stage for our discussion this afternoon Per

activities focussing on the efforts to settle claims already purchased and with a view towards collecting cash by year end In addition there is a brief summary of the pipeline for that is shaping up If all the stars align we should have a significant portion of our working capital back in by yearend and a number of transactions primed for the first quarter of We have one small live transaction that has been caught up in Enrons financial mess It is a deal agreed to with Pacificorp to buy a claim for which has an expected sales value of We had prepared a dash for approval to buy the claim but changed tact to avoid processing approvals for any new claims business for the time being Instead we are using the option built into our JV agreement which allows our partner GRS to fund claims purchases separately if we decline a transaction So rather than have Enron fund the purchase and take the risk GRS will find an alternative arrangement and share the revenue with us through the JV agreement Not an ideal situation especially since this mechanism was intended to handle one off large transactions they liked but we were uncomfortable with Nevertheless it keeps us in the business and hopefully sets up a better value for the eventual inclusion of the activity together with other parts of IRMs business for Energy Re Please note the larger deals in the pipeline with Equitas KMS and Home I want to point out that while calling this a trading business may be a stretch on our part especially if defined in the classic sense of trading a commodity ie the ability to go short first The willingness of Equitas and others to give us a sale price to work from is essentially a free put option that creates a synthetic short for us Overtime their cooperation should allow us to run a book of business from both perspectives ie going long first when the price is right or going short first by having the sales price agreed in advance with the Schemes Per Original Message From Blesie Brad Sent Monday November AM To Sekse Per Cc Paterniti Jason Subject Claims trading update and pipeline Below is an update of where we are on collecting for the four claims purchased to date and the pipeline for the rest of this year and first part of next Status Janet Wood is finalizing some adjustments to the release documents for the three schemes so that we can use the power of attorney granted to us in the assignments to sign the release on behalf of the insureds The documents will go to the schemes this week KMS has agreed to pay us k for their share of the four purchsed claims Phillips Montrose Kaiser and Mitchell which is just slightly less than what we asked for They are ready to sign for Phillips now once the document tweaking above is finished and are awaiting a few more bits of paper on the other three so we will sign Phillips as soon as the release language is agreed and the others hopefully this week or next so we should have the funds in by yearend PRO has agreed Phillips and is willing to let us sign the release document prevsiously sent to Phillips but as noted above we need to modify the document somewhat and put GRSs name on it I dont know for sure how long they will take to turn docs but next this week or next is possible w funds again by the end of the year They have almost all the documentation for the other three and seem to be able to turn things around quickly so we should have the other claims accepted and documents agreed win two weeks They have said they can pay on short notice so we should have current payouts on all four claims total of MM in by yearend As noted earlier PRO has reversed their previous assertion that they are willing to do onetime settlementscommutations We are working to get this changed and understand why they have done it since it is obviously bad news The existing deals look fine even w this development except Phillips which ends up w a gross margin of about which is obviously unsatisfactory These figures are wo the benefit of Omnis pricing however which has been promised for Wednesday There are various ways to manage around this development but the first choice is to get the policy changed The administrator for OIC and EA two of the three companies managed by Omni has promised pricing for Wednesday which will go a long way towards nailing down valuations They have a slower processing time than the other schemes three to five months officially but generally one to two in practice but are potentially willing to negotiate price and pay before their process is done w a part of the proceeds held in escrow in case their calculation of gross settlement amount differs from ours We will also hear this week their proposal for how this would work but they have said we should be able to get funds by yearend The administrator for Andrew Weir the other company managed by Omni is working on pricing also and promised it for this week or next He is subject to the same time constraint as OICEA noted above but is willing to give us all or most of the current payout before Omni finishes its work so we should have that k in by yearend as well Assuming all of the above works as planned we should have all funds recovered by year end except the tails of PRO k and Andrew Weir k and whatever haircut or escrow amount OICEA want to hold back pending final calculation of Gross Settlement Amount Pipeline This is a snapshot of the pipelineopportunities Unless otherwise noted assume gross margins of The last four items illustrate that the markets we are selling to are increasingly willing to give us a number up front on claims that they have been unable to settle which removes much of the uncertainty regarding valuation and makes our origination efforts more focused Pacificorp k price agreed Hercules close to agreement on MM price Dupont negotiating price of approximately MM Owens Illinois negotiating price of approximately MM Burlington Santa Fe negotiating price of approximately MM Home Insurance is working up numbers on all or part of a portfolio that we can purchase from their insureds for MM Equitas has identified claims for which they will pay us MM for the solvent piece alone upside would be the difference between that figure and what we can buy them for plus everything that can be recovered from the schemes KMS has given us numbers up front that they
