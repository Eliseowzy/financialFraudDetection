been sent to you by I thought you might want to read this Jim Trying to Restore Confidence in Enron to Salvage a Merger November By RICHARD A OPPEL Jr and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN The Enron Corporation newsquote and Dynegy Inc newsquote worked yesterday to find ways to bolster confidence in Enrons weakened energy trading business as the companies negotiators continued talks on revising the terms of their merger executives close to the talks said The renegotiated deal would cut the value of the acquisition by half they said to roughly billion Dynegy they said was also prepared to invest at least an additional million in Enron on top of the billion cash infusion from Dynegys biggest investor ChevronTexaco included in the initial deal announced Nov But Dynegy wants the new cash backed by hard assets and the companies were trying to identify and value enough Enron holdings not already mortgaged to other creditors the executives said Before a series of financial disclosures sent Enrons stock into collapse and the company into the arms of Dynegy its Houston rival Enrons natural gas and electricity trading floors did more business than the two largest competitors combined They also accounted for the majority of Enrons profits by far But traders and Wall Street analysts said the business had steadily deteriorated amid questions about the depths of Enrons financial straits Many traders have curtailed dealings with Enron and the executives close to the talks said Dynegy officials scouring Enrons books were having difficulty this week figuring out how much cash the trading operation was generating The executives close to the talks said that the renegotiated terms for Dynegys acquisition of Enron would lower the price to about Dynegy share for each share of Enron cutting by half the value of the deal announced Nov when Dynegy offered share If a deal is struck at Dynegy share at yesterdays closing prices Dynegy would be paying about an Enron share a percent premium over Enrons diminished stock price The premium was percent over Enrons closing price on the day that the deal was announced Both companies are seeking promises from Enrons bank lenders to extend debt repayment dates until after the merger closes And they are also discussing adding provisions that could limit Dynegys ability to back out of the combination The two companies are also working to arrange a cash infusion of million from J P Morgan Chase newsquote and Citigroup newsquote that would provide Enron with desperately needed new cash But there is growing concern that the cash infusion from the banks will not calm investors fears or reassure energy traders leading Dynegy to seek an additional million in cash for Enron Late yesterday the two companies were hung up over whether Enron which has already used many of its most prized assets as collateral for loans has enough assets left to serve as collateral for the additional money according to executives close to the talks A number of Enron assets were being examined including some that have already been used to obtain other loans the executives said The assets include Transwestern Pipeline a major natural gas pipeline that links the gasproducing basins of Texas and the Southwest with California Enrons stake in other gas pipeline assets its percent stake worth about million in EOG Resources newsquote a former subsidiary that is now an independent publicly traded oil and gas company and its indirect stake in Hanover Compressor which manufactures equipment used to increase the pressure of natural gas and facilitate its flow on interstate pipelines Yesterday investors anxiously awaited a report by Moodys Investors Service which like other major creditrating firms currently ranks Enrons debt at the lowest investmentgrade level If Enron were to lose its investmentgrade status it could be forced to repay or refinance up to billion in debt while other traders would probably further curtail business But by late yesterday Moodys newsquote decided not to issue a statement after receiving assurances from Enron and Dynegy officials that a renegotiated deal would be announced soon the executives said A Moodys spokesman declined comment Executives close to the talks said that they hoped that new cash from Dynegy would reassure both Wall Street and the energytrading markets that Enrons trading floor would survive and remain a valuable asset But analysts and investors are having difficulty figuring how much value the trading operation has already lost and how much the business has been reduced because of credit concerns I believe Dynegy is probably seeing that deterioration in the core business and wants to renegotiate the purchase price as a result said Andre Meade head of United States utilities research for Commerzbank Securities in New York I dont think anyone can estimate the earning power of Enron over the next three to four quarters and Im not sure Enron has a good estimate Mr Meade said he did not believe that Dynegys earlier estimate that the acquisition would add cents a share to its earnings was reliable today given how sharply the business seems to have deteriorated By Mr Meades calculations if Enrons trading volumes were to fall percent next year even if normal volume growth levels returned in that would wipe out nearly all the value in the stock Karen Denne an Enron spokeswoman said the company had experienced a decline in energy trading volume and in the number of traders doing business with it but both stabilized yesterday She declined to elaborate or quantify the decline She also said that Enrons trading operation remained profitable though she could not quantify it and she also said she did not know whether the company was working on a possible bankruptcy filing or other contingency plans should its business and liquidity worsen Were moving forward with the merger she said Dynegy officials did not return telephone calls yesterday Shares of Enron rose yesterday on news of a possible revised acquisition agreement They closed at up percent or cents Shares of Dynegy closed at up percent or Though yesterdays gains halted a fourday slide in Enron shares the stock is down percent this year after disclosures of major losses as well as significant accounting errors that led Enron to admit it overstated profits during the last five years by nearly million Now difficulties within Enrons trading operation are exacerbating the companys overall liquidity problems in three ways according to some analysts and rival energytrading executives First other traders are requiring Enron to put up greater margin on its trades On top of that in some cases Enrons traders are being forced to pay more to buy natural gas than traders at other companies This credit premium in some transactions has ranged from cents to cents for every million British thermal units of gas Enron buys these people say Additionally many traders like the Mirant Corporation newsquote have either scaled back or stopped doing business with Enron hurting its trading revenue Mr Meade of Commerzbank said enduse customers and trading counterparties appear to be shifting their business to competitors as a result of Enrons credit concerns and are reluctant to increase their exposures to Enron businessPLAChtmlexeienefdefbdfae HOW TO ADVERTISE For information on
