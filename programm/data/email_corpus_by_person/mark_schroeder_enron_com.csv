Secy Goldwyn mac i have a slightly different view on your point the israelis are actually pushing for a palestinian water project as it will greatly strengthen the israeli position in the land settlement discussions in the peace talks the PNA is saying that they need more land in the west bank in order to gain more access to aquifers under the land the isaelis want a desal project for the PNA so that they can claim that the PNA has a larger water base and thus does not need to have more land for access to more water the issue is that there is not practical way in which gaza generated water can efficiently reach the west bank thus a water project in gaza should really be a moot point in this discussion although it will not be due to the lack of rationale to their discussions i think that it is worth pointing out that the US consulate and embassy in israel have been helpful to us from the macro level there needs to be more proactive cooperation between the PNA and GOI on this project due to the logistical and technical reasons that mac pointed out below furthermore it it worth noting that the PNA need to be more willing to adapt their standards to be more in line with large international transactions as the local process that they wish to cling to is very cumbersome and will not benefit the PNA by attracting large scale foreign investment please let me know if you

Secy Goldwyn The IPP in Gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule This combined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in Gaza and the first by a major Western company anywhere in Palestine There are several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the Secretarys visit All equipment for the plant must transit Israel We have been assured by the Israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it is on the list of equipment we provide them That said there are countless opportunities for equipment to be delayed in Israel awaiting clearance whether on the list or not First power could be delayed indefinitely if the Israelis choose to do so for political security or other reasons Fuel for the plant once operational will also transit Israel Again disruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the plug on power in Gaza Gas from Egypt has been discussed it remains to be seen if that will be a reality anytime soon Although not officially from the Israeli government we have been told that as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced the Israelis will turn off supply of electricity to Gaza The current consumption is about MW The first phase of the plant will produce MW This appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby Israel sells Gaza electricity to make up the difference That electricity is likely to be more expensive than that which the plant will supply Enron could well end up being blamed for the higher cost Water is another critical issue The Palestinians want their own supply of fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated Israel is currently selling water to Gaza it is not in Israels best interest to lose this customer therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project OPIC project funding is problematical Since they originally invited Enron to take on this project they should necessarily also be involved Lack of OPIC support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up costs The Israelis must also approve the environmental impact of the plant The plant will meet or exceed World Bank guidelines more so when operating on gas While not a probem at this point the Israelis could delay constructionoperation over environmental concerns Andrew is the lead developer for this project and

think he is trying his best to get on top of the EBS tasks we have given him HOWEVER having said that and before having received his report below I was going to write you an email indicating that I am afraid we cannot continue to keep David in this role I just returned from Tokyo office opening meetings etc There I saw Sanjay who confirmed his imminent new role for EBS Asia Anthony Duenner President EBS Asia and Bill White head of EBS Asia Trading David simply does not enjoy the confidence of his commercial clients in EBS and notwithstanding my comments above about the level of his effort I do not see turning this around His problem is not any single one thing but a cumulation of things which I list below but I think it is the totality that feeds the general view He was probably only a decent fit with the old Enron APACHI when it was assetfocussed and he could use his diplomatic experience to open doors for projects Even then he was never an Enron person in terms of our culture and being isolated in Singapore has probably not helped to get him inculcated in the company culture With EBS and Enron Asia taking a much more merchant business focus he just does not get it Chris Hunt APACHI and Jim Row exEBS encoureaged him to developpursue origination leads EBS does not want him doing that and the assetfocussed stuff he keeps tossing the way of the enrgy groups is grating to them given that they simply see him as not getting the message that the company has moved away from assets Bill White tells me that he David has not performed well in a meeting It is a single data point but Bill is also known to me from Enron Europe days and he is not a particularly critical person David only exacerbates this by being insecure about his role and trying too hard to sell himself to the clientscustomers internally and they find this teidous Frankly though it is not the only source of Davids problems I think he was illserved by Donald Lassere and XiXi the associate who I am confident conducted what is know here as a whispering campaign ie he does not know what he is doing he is not an expert in the filed and generally acting like a pair of juveniles when it has come to any effort to bring a sense of stability and order to the clients eg dont know what I am supposed to be doing In any event I simply do not see much prospect of persuading the EBS people to give David a chance and I think I will be doing myself no favours with them by pushing it SO either we find another role eg in in Washington and I am nor sure they need someone with Davids skill sets or we let David go Your thoughts In terms of supporting EBS Asia I think the new guy I hired here in London could do it quite capably but all of the biz is either in Houston or I am told Sanjay is contemplating a move to Singapore so in eitheerr case my guy here can probably not be effective from the standpoint of being read into the business From where I am I would prefer to have someone in Singapore or Tokyo rather than Houston but the people in Houston may want someone closer to them I frankly think it is a mistake to try to build a business in Asia from Houston Sanjay mentioned the guy who is his General Counsel at Dabhol Power Company and I will discretely check with Jane Wilson on her impressions but he will not be communications literatespecialised Look forward to your ideas mcs Forwarded by Mark SchroederLONECT on David NRONDEVELOPMENT To Mark CT cc Subject Status Report Mark Here is a status report I met with Anthony Duenner Friday in Korea He approved expenses from his budget for some of the consulting work in Hong Kong that needs to be done Korean work with a law firm to see if we can get a new decision on bandwidth trading continuing expenses of the present tariff consultant in Japan I have done separate emails on and copied to you So that concern is taken care of Everything seems to be going very well so far in the new assignment Thanks for giving me the lead Here is country by country status Korea I went up the learning curve a lot on the Korea trip see sep email on the regulatory problem we discovered and proposed strategy to deal with it I now feel very much on top of Korea Will go back to advance the work on overturning the adverse regulatory ruling To my mind this is exactly what a regulatory review should do identify regulatory risks before we go in Hong Kong We have identified somebody in EBS to do the system configuration report I am going to go up there to advance the tariff submission that is due before year end Japan I need to get up there and get up to speed on what the consultant is doing on tariff and terms and conditions Singapore I am reminding the lawyers to get a corporate entity selected so we can proceed with a license

being a regulatory issue of interest mcs Forwarded by Mark SchroederLONECT on David NRONDEVELOPMENT To Robbi ES Michelle nron Communications Anthony NRON COMMUNICATIONS cc Wayne GardnerEnron nron Communications Mark CT JaeMoo NRON Craig nron Communications Stephen D NRON Mike DahlkeENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Korea Regulatory Impediment to Bandwidth Trading Action Plan Our regulatory review team in Korea this week has identified a major regulatory impediment to bandwidth trading in Korea This describes the problem and outlines a draft strategy to deal with it with actions shown in blue Problem It appears that under the Telecommunications Business Law as interpreted by the Korea Communications Commission in a recent ruling against MCI a Specific Services Provider Type which we want to be cannot resell International Private Leased Circuits wholesale Only a Facilities Based provider Network Services Provider can do resale of International Leased Lines under the current law We do not want to be a Network Services Provider because an NSP can not exceed foreign ownership and has immense responsibilities Factual Background We want to be a specific services provider Type reseller with facilities such as servers and switches Under the law as interpreted in the recent ruling however SSPs can buy or lease international lines only from NSPs cannot sell International Private Leased Circuits to other SSPs to ValueAdded Service Providers VSPs or to ISPs can sell international capacity only to end users not to other wholesalers The recent ruling came about when MCI not a Network Service Provider leased international lines from an NSP in Korea and resold them to Goldman Sachs for traffic to Hong Kong Korea Telecom brought a case against MCI to the Korea Communications Council KCC for decision Kim and Chang our Enron energy lawyers in Korea handled the case they did not disclose to us that MCI was the client The KCC ruled for KT and against MCI Im not sure yet why Goldman Sachs was treated as a wholesaler and not an end user which should have been legal At this point however the situation is that if a foreign company tried to resell IPLCs wholesale any local NSP could bring a complaint to the KCC and would run the regulatory risk of being forced to cease The sources for this conclusion are Kim and Chang the Ministry of Info and Communications and the Korea Information Society Institute a telecom policy think tank for the Ministry Options Change the law A revision of the law is drafted but does not fix this and changes are closed for this year Amendments on the floor of Parliament are impossible in Korea For a change in law we would have to try in summer to get a change in early Change by Presidential Decree is also possible but is overkill Not feasible Get a new interpretation from the Korea Communications Council that says what we plan to do in Korea in bandwidth is OK We would ask Kim and Chang to present our proposed plans to the KCC before we enter the bandwidth trading BWT market We would describe it in a way that is sufficiently different from the MCI case Jae Moo made this suggestion Pro If we get a favorable ruling we are in business We do not have money at risk unless the regulatory road is clear Con an unfavorable ruling slams the door specifically on us Recommended Steps We should explore this option with Kim and Chang Robbi or Michelle if you agree please contact Kim and Chang to discuss this and authorize start of this work if they agree with this approach I will work with you to develop the scope of work and can operate with Kim and Chang during the work as necessary We will contact MCI to get more facts on their case including whether they were selling to a wholesaler who sold to Goldman or directly to Goldman We can say the Ministry mentioned their case We should probably not be thinking about joint action with MCI at this point as we want to say our case is different if we can I will explore facts with an MCI contact in Tokyo and Craig will do same in Singapore Redefine where a sale of IPLCs takes place to have it not be in Korea Would need legalcommercial creative analysis Possible but uncertain option Redefine the product so as not to be a resale If we buy capacity and chop it up into smaller pieces or alter it before we sell it maybe we are not reselling what we bought But we may still have a problem if the new product is sold to wholesalers Lets explore and above and similar ideas in a conference call Robbi can you set up a call on this with me Donald youMichelle Wayne Gardner Craig Clark Roger Estrada Xi Xi Partnerjv with a local firm already having the NSP status such as KT SK Telecom Dacom etc or become an NSP foreign ownership restirction Huge regulatory filing Not feasible Parallel Actions Take issue up with US Trade Representative telecom in DC Jonathan McHale Also work with local Amcham telecom committee and US Embassy We should do this in parallel with whatever option we choose I will work on this with Steve Burns in DC when we are farther along Work to promote understanding of the merits of BWT for Koreaelsewhere BWT was never contemplated in the laws and regulations All our contacts said BWT needed to be explained more widely in Korea to gain support It is new even to the telecom think tanks We need to do missionary work on this to develop

international activity June November This mailing is a periodic update of the status of international electric power sector privatization and restructuring Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace Governments faced with burgeoning power demands but lacking the funds to meet them are nearly universally opening their generation markets to foreign investors even where privatization is not on the agenda More and more stateowned utilities are unbundling Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the wholesale and retail levels A few international players have scaled back their international investments and shifted substantial portions of their portfolio to less risky markets such as the US or Europe Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive As Asian economies recover most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans After a year in which currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit Latin America a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to restart but at a slower pace This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe AsiaPacific Latin America and the Middle East Africa Maps that summarize the status of restructuring in Europe Asia Latin America and Africa and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits A slippery slope is Exhibit Timelines showing the opening of markets in various countries by region are in Exhibits See attached file Intlmail exhibitsppt February marked the opening of the market to choice for most large EU customers who use over GWh a year This accounts for about a fourth of demand As of EDay neither France nor Italy had passed their proposed enabling legislation While the EU intended for the transmission operator to be independent EDF intends to retain control over the grid as will ENEL A phased deregulation of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in August Mergers alliances and consolidation are a dominant theme as companies jockey for position in the new European power market There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross borders as suppliers of new generation as purchasers of assets being spun off by liberalization decrees Italy or because of market concentration rulings in mergers Germany Spain Several international companies have opened trading offices in Europe or Enron Reliant Southern TXU HoustonStreetcom launched a European online wholesale energytrading platform Austria Austrias liberalizing market is facing problems from within and without The EU is dissatisfied with its lack of GTD unbundling although accounts were formally separated in There is no ISO Internally there is intense discussion about an accelerated market opening customers over GWh now have choice Regional utilities are angry over the Verbunds proposal to open of the market in late The Verbund a SOU is the largest generator and owns the transmission grid However it has no retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already deregulated wholesale customers CB White Judith Lezaun Denmark The liberalization law exceeds the EU directives goals

to lower its ownership further The largest new entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall with its acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity Further MA in the distribution and supply sector is expected Cecilia Bergman France There was irony in Frances push for liberalization as it assumed its sixmonth EU presidency France passed its electricity law last February a year after required by EU directive but had odd implementation decrees stalled in the National Assembly However EDF which still controls more than of French generation realized Brussels would hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained closed It recently convinced French authorities to open up of the market by the end of instead of lowering the eligibility threshold to GWhyear from GWh EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from easily entering the energy services market leading EDF to promote a relatively rapid total opening of the French market Corinne Aigroz White Germany While the Electricity Law was officially effective in April real competition is still impeded by complicated TPA grid access conditions especially on the retail market A group of new entrants has organized to call for a governmental regulator Some recent studies have shown the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a massive crosssubsidization between network operations and marketing Recent charges have been made of obstacles to competition by a mulitiplicity of fees including customer switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies In the last months MA among big national and international utilities has redrawn the German utility landscape EDF bought a share in EnBW Veba Viag merged to form EON and RWEVEW merged into RWE Furthermore RWE and EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust authority Currently several utilities are and battling for control of East German VEAG whose transmission connections make it a portal to Eastern Europe

later Greece has been given until by the EU to conform to the Directive An IEA report suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector structure First the government should create a clearer separation between itself and the stateowned PPC including a separate regulatory agency Second the government should consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to maximize competition as well as improving market access conditions for IPPs and cogenerators As the countrys largest employer PPC is not likely to effect these changes quickly White Thomas Read Ireland Supply competition was introduced in February for customers over GWh of the market Opening is scheduled to increase to in with further liberalisation in No date for midmarket and full retail opening has been set Incumbent ESB plans to split off its transmission business which will remain stateowned Competition in generation will be introduced in with the auctioning of ESB capacity which is intended to create at least two new players Independent power production has been allowed for two years now Ben Joyce Italy Italy approved its market deregulation decree in March in some measures it goes beyond the EU Directive ENEL had dominated of generation by no entity can control more than or by This requires that ENEL sell between GW and GW of its GW by It has separated GTD into separate legal entities and been

at but with renegotiated contracts the figure is more like Sweden forms part of NordPool a common electricity market a forum for physical and financial exchanges Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market and an OTC market for financial trading Consolidation has occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation market is concentrated in the hands of large actors Cecilia Bergman Switzerland In October Parliament passed an electricity market law The first phase of the liberalization should start in granting choice to large industrials GWh the midsize market will open in GWh In the law envisions a fully open market Some aspects of the new law such as the transmission tariff model are still being discussed Chris Brombacher White UK With market deregulation complete full

National Electricity Market comprising Victoria and NSW started operating in December Queensland SA and ACT will join in the next few years China China is aiming for nationwide interconnection including Hong Kong by Power pooling and increased interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai provinces As there is no process or body in place to oversee reforms some believe that sector reform is a mere slogan Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs following a government decision to cap the ROR for new projects at Another issue is lack of government guarantees China plans to build hundreds of small rural hydro projects and to spend Ynbn to upgrade rural power grids in as part of a project to bring electricity to million people who currently have no access India Five of Indias states have undertaken significant reforms Orissa Haryana Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh And only four of the State Electricity Boards SEBs the principal buyers for independent power are profitable IPP builders have been frustrated by a host of regulations lack of guarantees and SEB insolvencies The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted this year by the withdrawal of two major investors EdF and Cogentrix A draft Electricity Bill will be introduced in Parliament this winter It would create and empower autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions SEBs would be unbundled into GTD and corporatized within four months of passage Initially states would initially retain GD assets they would later be privatized Transmission assets would be put under an independent authority and TPA would be allowed Significantly IPP licensing requirements would be clarified and reduced and largely eliminated for the growing segment of captive producers A key problem of theft as high as of TD losses in some areas would be addressed by strict metering and high penalties The likelihood however of the Bill being passed as proposed is not strong as it faces significant opposition both by unions and regional parties in Parliament Indonesia Indonesias IPP program has faced problems over power purchase costs and project rates of return with bankrupt stateowned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP operators for power Of planned IPP projects only three now supply power six others are ready to generate PLN reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which Paiton will supply energy for months at a rate said to be much lower than the original agreedupon price Other PPA renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss until the Indonesian economy revives and PLNs financial situation improves Unbundling is underway on JavaBali where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries Outside JavaBali unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting to develop rules for a competitive market Japan On March large customers of the market were allowed to choose a supplier This broke the monopolies of the ten regional IOUs for the first time but high transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting true competition Newer liberalization measures in the electricity and gas sectors have since been written an agreement was signed at the July G Summit which provides for fair and transparent nondiscriminatory access to distribution networks in both sectors A number of new companies are entering or planning to enter the market largely set up as JVs with local nonincumbents often offering new products and services In

fixed ROR of but IPPs face continued lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties Problems continue over Hub Power Company Hubco the largest IPP project in Pakistan Hubco is receiving significantly lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted The government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA was amended in the s making the wholesale power tariff untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco More than of plants have already been sold in a phased selloff of WAPDAs generation Eight parties have been shortlisted for the pending privatization of of Karachi Electric Supply Commission but the sale has been often delayed Philippines An Omnibus Electricity Bill which will set the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor is stalled in a HouseSenate reconciliation committee The Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all financial assistance including million in loans for power related projects until the legislation is passed Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department officials are looking at several alternate options for selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill Governmentappointed advisers have also recommended that Napocor renegotiate some of its takeorpay contracts with IPPs asking some IPPs to reduce power offtake on an interim basis Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these conditions a longer life span for their projects but developers are reluctant to accept because of their own financial commitments Singapore Since initial restructuring and corporatization in and the establishment of a pool in Singapore has lagged in power sector deregulation Investors complain that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for large consumers A thorough review in by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recommended that generation be privatized but with restrictions on generation crossownership transmission and market operation functions be separated and an ISO established and that most retail services be privatized The government has granted two public retail licenses meaning that the two IPPs can sell electricity directly to large users Retail licenses are expected to be issued to the three power generators This will allow full competition for large industrial and commercial customers but retail competition for smaller customers is unlikely to be in place before South Korea South Korea is proceeding with a major restructuring program following government approval in July for stateowned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco Each of the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea Stock Exchange up to foreign ownership will be permitted The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO which will initially retain its TD services Later a UKtype pool will be established where all generators will sell into the pool Competition in distribution and retailing is a longterm target IPP projects totaling MW are already in operation Impending restructuring has not deterred foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs Taiwan Two phases of IPP development have been approved but only one IPP scheme has started up Developers have faced land acquisition problems causing IPP schedules to slip In the government announced plans to launch Phase Three limited to gasfired plants An Electricity Act is before Parliament Its main provisions include privatizing Taipower without unbundling GTD allowing other companies to enter the market as either vertically integrated generation transmission or distribution companies and to pay Taipower a fee for using its facilities and the creation of an independent regulator especially for tariffs IPPs will be able to supply customers at kV and above and IPP prices will not be regulated Thailand The State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid out a threestage process for all stateowned enterprises including power to create fully competitive restructured and privatized sectors A draft Energy Act is under discussion while preparation and implementation of various technical frameworks are underway Under the Act a competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent and independent regulatory body EGAT transferred two thermal units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October EGAT also plans to corporatize and partially privatize its nonhydro plants by Before the economic crisis the government had an ambitious IPP program EGAT now has excess capacity so has delayed many projects Its longterm plans include the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants SPPs using renewable energy PPAs have been signed with SSPs Vietnam Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its power system Electricity of Vietnam EVN is an unbundled state monopoly which does not even service rural customers Local villages provide services to small farmers and small commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards The World Bank has approved a million credit to Vietnam to extend grid electricity to about households scattered throughout the country A few IPPs are trying to win generation projects An Electricity Law due to be enacted in would establish a National Electricity Office for regulation This would replace the existing haphazard villagelevel regulatory system Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations many Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations At the same time ownership limits imposed by several governments limit further investments by companies who have already entered the market According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of Venezuela and Mexico It estimates that million Latin Americans are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to investments And for those who were already open a new development is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either as concessions to build or as full privatizations A big factor impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance on hydropower Serious regionwide droughts during the last few years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors Argentina The big news is in Argentina transmission sector This fall Argentina auctioned off of Transener in an IPO while also offering six lines to the private sector on a BOM buildoperatemaintain basis Endesa Spain must divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to antitrust concerns Endesas two companies are now serving of the countries million people The regulator believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate efficiency and to set prices Brazil Brazils wholesale energy market WEM began operating in October initially only of power bought or sold will go through WEM As other contracts expire it will eventually supervise billion worth of power The WEM intends also to create an internetbased trading system The Brazilian system hydrorun is dependent on plentiful rains to avoid shortages Demand growth has far outstripped GDP while new generation is not keeping pace Analysts predict a shortage in with intermittent brownouts while neighbors are building generation with an eye to exporting power to Brazil Sao Paulo state will sell of CESP Parana one of the last large generation privatizations in December The state is incenting buyers by offering financing for any premium paid over the minimum price of R billion US mil Brazil also conducted a successful action of three transmission lines in August on a buildoperate basis Bolivia Ende Bolivias utility was unbundled in and has been successively sold off through capitalization a stake and management control To meet demand rising at annually the government has ordered these buyers to invest million in the next three years or face losing their concessions they have not fulfilled previous obligations in upgrades Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow distributors to generate up to of demand instead of Chile Privatization in Chile is largely complete Endesas Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the basis for its diversification into telecom via its subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra Partially in response to Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans which will open the distribution market and reduce node unregulated prices from MW to MW Until now transmission charges have been based on existing operating costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also intended to remove control of the grid operation from the generators The proposed changes likely account for Hydro Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for the sale of Transelec in September marked a serious recession and drought seriously affecting hydro generators which represent nearly of Chiles generation Under the existing system generators had no incentive to plan for longterm supply Chile hopes the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to generation and to introduce competition into distribution heretofore a monopoly Colombia Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks against transmission installations have forced the government to postpone the sale of any further power assets including Isagen the state generator ISA the transco as well as regional distributors A March attack for instance caused a blackout in provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or more The government claims to be reassessing the rules but the reality is that the assets would not receive any decent offer now For now million new shares of capital in ISA will be sold to the public at a discount to democratize the power sector Since January of the market has had choice Cuba The first IPP began delivering power to Cubas grid in October In order to curb programmed blackouts it has invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new crude reserves Cuba hopes that of its power will be generated from local fuels by yearend Dominican Republic Blackouts still plague this nation a year after the government split stateowned CDE into separate GTD units Investors paid for a stake and management control of nonhydro generation and of distribution The new government is requiring IPPs who provide of the republics power to renegotiate the terms of the privatization contracts signed with the prior government In the hopes of increasing competition and lowering prices the gencos are planning a power clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to TD companies It will however only function when there is adequate electricity to meet demand Ecuador The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale of its power sector There is a current investment limit of which may need to be raised to The government realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization in order to attract capital Its largest utility EMELEC will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive debts El Salvador In October AES bought Reliants interest in three discos privatized in which together serve of the population CEL the SOU does not plan to privatize its hydro assets or the transmission grid for the moment Guatemala Guatemala sold two major discos in investors have made significant system upgrades State utility INDE still owns of the countrys generation all in hydro It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early s with takeorpay PPAs IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid access The power sector while needing new investment for the next five years may soon be in trouble due to currency devaluation high fuel costs and the effect of the PPAs Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing regulations to their law to encourage more investment Jamaica For the second time in four years the Jamaican government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC which handles all of TD and of the islands generation And for the second time it is Southern who is in the forefront of privatization negotiations It is still not clear what percent will be sold but it seems likely to be a marginal minority of without GTD first being spunoff Mexico The new Fox administration plans to revive electricity reform tabled last year without which energy cannot keep pace with economic growth Fox says there will be no privatizations but an opening of the market Private participation in the distribution sector would require a constitutional change Many believe that constitutional change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms Mexico estimates it needs investments of billion in the power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand reserve margins are at while consumption is growing at annually Without a clear regulatory bill opening the market to competition investment is inhibited IPPs have heretofore been built on a BOO basis Recent tenders have included the option to build either in the US or Mexico with power dedicated to Mexico Nicaragua The privatization of stateowned power company ENEL is underway following its restructuring Assets were first split into GTD companies In September Spains Union Fenosa acquired of two discos for million in an auction in which it was the sole bidder High oil prices forced the government to postpone the October sale of the three gencos two of the three prequalified companies failed to submit final bids Also the political opposition has challenged the legality of the privatization in the Supreme Court Panama Privatization of governmentheld IRHE is now complete of distribution and generation was sold in The government plans to retain control of transmission Foreign investors are involved in

there are no plans to open the market completely A wholesale market is proposed for Venezuela has the lowest tariffs in the Western hemisphere due to high subsidization While the government dithered on privatization plans AES jumped in with a surprise bid for the ADRs of Electricidad de Caracas The government recently announced a tentative sale date of early for of two regional electric companies Enelven and Semda Privatization has oft been postponed most recently because of unknown effects of Venezuelas new electricity law on its rate policy Virgin Islands In September this US territorys Senate quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for an purchase of the Water and Power Authority The Islands could use the money but the Senate objected to the lack of bidding or transparency It was in principle opposed neither to privatization nor to Southern African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their power sectors to foreign investment although most have not moved beyond allowing IPPs Many GulfStates IPPs are for water and power Increasingly power sector forecasts include reliance on the private sector for generation capacity additions Five SubSaharan countries have privatized their power systems Cte dIvoire Gabon Guinea Mali and Senegal A few countries are beginning to discuss partial privatization of the entire governmentowned entity rather than spinning off GTD and undergoing separate privatization Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put pressure on prices due to sustained droughts especially in East Africa Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing restructuring agendas in different countries A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the schemes for regional transmission links The Mozambique Transmission Company links South Africa Mozambique and Swaziland the West African Power Pool will link countries there is a SixCountry link underway between Egypt Jordan Iraq Syria and Turkey and later Lebanon Algeria Interior minister Khelil who as a World Bank official oversaw the restructuring of state oil companies in several countries is committed to a profound restructuring of Sonatrach the NOC and the power sector Sonelgaz Legislation was introduced this summer that would unbundle GTD end Sonelgaz generation monopoly and allow for IPPs on a BOT basis Some of the IPPs are intended for domestic consumption and some for export Algeria is keenly interested in sending power to deregulating European markets via a new undersea link to Spain Ghana With a vast hydroelectric station on the Volta River of Ghanas current power needs are supplied by hydroelectricity Ghanas planned privatization of its distribution company into regional companies is possible in It is implementing a series of power sector reforms designed to provide Ghanaians with universal access to electricity and to transform Ghana into a middleincome country within one generation It is moving

No sale of transmission assets is planned Nigeria The IMF has provided Nigeria a billion facility to encourage reform and to support civilian President Obasnjo In November the government announced plans to privatize ailing NEPA the SOU While a draft electricity policy has been prepared no details have emerged They intend to send regulatory legislation to the parliament by the end of December which should include a framework for foreign IPP investors It is also likely that NEPA will be broken up prior to privatization Enron is supplying MW via bargemounted power facilties off Lagos to ease the power shortages in this oilrich country Senegal Showing how risky foreign investment remains the new Senegalese government has asked Hydro Qubec and Elyo to leave less than two years after they won a interest in state EU Snlec The current government while acknowledging the advances made in rehabilitating old plants cited cronyism on the part of its predecssors South Africa Eskom South Africas parastatal generates of the countrys power and transmits it over national lines to municipal distributors South Africa is moving slowly towards restructuring and unbundling of GTD The fragmented distribution system will be merged into six discos while plants may be grouped into gencos Last year GTD activities were ringfenced to evaluate costs for each business A new structure for the electricity supply industry is being discussed and the possibility of privatizing of Eskoms power stations has been raised for the first time Electricity regulators announced in November that they were considering three bids for the first IPP license to be offered next year While South Africa needs new generation capacity by it now exports power to its neighbors and is very active in the creation of a regional transmission network Eskom has ambitions to be a global player while continuing to focus on its development agenda of rural electrification Eskom Enterprises the unregulated business subsidiary is considering an IPO Egypt In July the Egyptian Electricity Authority was converted into a holding company although still stateowned It intends to offer stakes in seven or eight regional GD companies The sale of Greater Cairo Electricity valued at billion will be first although it has been twice postponed All capacity additions will be solicited competitively as IPPs under the BOOT build own operate transfer model This allows developers to recover construction costs by running a plant while the state eventually owns the project without affecting its debt profile Egypt is part of a planned SixCountry transmission link Israel Israel has been discussing restructuring and privatization for a few years now but no real progress has been made An electricity law passed in March extended the Israel Electric Company IEC license for years in exchange for its accepting of it power needs MW from IPPs and another from foreign developers So far only one IPP has been built Recent offshore gas discoveries have been largely in Palestinian waters further exploration will be necessary before Israel which has no indigenous fuel sources knows whether it will have an assured fuel supply Jordan With virtually no indigenous oil or gas Jordan has been highly dependent on Iraqi oil In early NEPCO the state utility was corporatized and GTD was unbundled Jordans first solicited IPP MW was awarded to Tractebel in May There is talk of relying on IPPs for further generation and of privatizing existing assets Consultants were sought in August to advise Jordan on distribution privatization Jordans transmission grid was linked to Egypt in the link to Syria should be completed soon Kuwait Lifting a freeze on large projects the cabinet has allowed two new IPPs MW MW with possible private financing options Forcasts for power show new MW needed in the next years Lebanon After years of war Lebanon is now engaged in massively rebuilding its infrastructure In April consultants were invited to bid on advising Lebanon on restructuring and eventual privatization of its power sector Lebanon was admitted in May to the planned SixCountry regional transmission linkup Palestine The outlook for Palestines energy independence changed in a moment this Autumn with offshore gas fields in acknowledged Palestinian waters proving substantial It has been nearly totally dependent on Israels IEC for power Qatar Officials announced in February that they had invited five companies to submit proposals for an IPP Foreign developers would hold a stake in a plant envisioned to begin at MW rising later to MW A decision would turn on a bid of less than centskWh to generate power Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabias demand growth has created a need for an additional GW of capacity by much of which will need to come from the private sector Privatization of the sector is being considered as is an unbundling of GTD As a first step in February the ten power companies were merged In April the Saudi Electricity Company was created as a jointstock company governmentowned The consensus among potential investors is that much needs to be done on the regulatory system the financial framework and on tariffs before IPPs become feasible For instance nationals pay only nominal amounts for power Early considerations of BOT projects to meet soaring demand were shelved Tunisia The Parliament passed enabling legislation for independent power in April While the government will continue to control DT and international trade all new generation will be open to the private sector The first IPP for MW is scheduled to come online in It will produce of Tunisias electricity United Arab Emirates The UAE is a confederation of Emirates Political power is concentrated in Abu Dhabi it and Dubai provide over of UAE income In the UAE called for comprehensive restructuring of the powerwater authority and for privatization through IPOs aimed at UAE nationals While privatization in Abu Dhabi is still anticipated Dubai has decided not to privatize these sectors Several IPPs are underway in Abu Dhai and Dubai as both BOO and BOOT The

Secy Goldwyn mac i have a slightly different view on your point the israelis are actually pushing for a palestinian water project as it will greatly strengthen the israeli position in the land settlement discussions in the peace talks the PNA is saying that they need more land in the west bank in order to gain more access to aquifers under the land the isaelis want a desal project for the PNA so that they can claim that the PNA has a larger water base and thus does not need to have more land for access to more water the issue is that there is not practical way in which gaza generated water can efficiently reach the west bank thus a water project in gaza should really be a moot point in this discussion although it will not be due to the lack of rationale to their discussions i think that it is worth pointing out that the US consulate and embassy in israel have been helpful to us from the macro level there needs to be more proactive cooperation between the PNA and GOI on this project due to the logistical and technical reasons that mac pointed out below furthermore it it worth noting that the PNA need to be more willing to adapt their standards to be more in line with large international transactions as the local process that they wish to cling to is very cumbersome and will not benefit the PNA by attracting large scale foreign investment please let me know if you

Secy Goldwyn The IPP in Gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule This combined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in Gaza and the first by a major Western company anywhere in Palestine There are several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the Secretarys visit All equipment for the plant must transit Israel We have been assured by the Israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it is on the list of equipment we provide them That said there are countless opportunities for equipment to be delayed in Israel awaiting clearance whether on the list or not First power could be delayed indefinitely if the Israelis choose to do so for political security or other reasons Fuel for the plant once operational will also transit Israel Again disruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the plug on power in Gaza Gas from Egypt has been discussed it remains to be seen if that will be a reality anytime soon Although not officially from the Israeli government we have been told that as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced the Israelis will turn off supply of electricity to Gaza The current consumption is about MW The first phase of the plant will produce MW This appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby Israel sells Gaza electricity to make up the difference That electricity is likely to be more expensive than that which the plant will supply Enron could well end up being blamed for the higher cost Water is another critical issue The Palestinians want their own supply of fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated Israel is currently selling water to Gaza it is not in Israels best interest to lose this customer therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project OPIC project funding is problematical Since they originally invited Enron to take on this project they should necessarily also be involved Lack of OPIC support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up costs The Israelis must also approve the environmental impact of the plant The plant will meet or exceed World Bank guidelines more so when operating on gas While not a probem at this point the Israelis could delay constructionoperation over environmental concerns Andrew is the lead developer for this project and

international activity June November This mailing is a periodic update of the status of international electric power sector privatization and restructuring Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace Governments faced with burgeoning power demands but lacking the funds to meet them are nearly universally opening their generation markets to foreign investors even where privatization is not on the agenda More and more stateowned utilities are unbundling Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the wholesale and retail levels A few international players have scaled back their international investments and shifted substantial portions of their portfolio to less risky markets such as the US or Europe Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive As Asian economies recover most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans After a year in which currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit Latin America a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to restart but at a slower pace This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe AsiaPacific Latin America and the Middle East Africa Maps that summarize the status of restructuring in Europe Asia Latin America and Africa and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits A slippery slope is Exhibit Timelines showing the opening of markets in various countries by region are in Exhibits See attached file Intlmail exhibitsppt February marked the opening of the market to choice for most large EU customers who use over GWh a year This accounts for about a fourth of demand As of EDay neither France nor Italy had passed their proposed enabling legislation While the EU intended for the transmission operator to be independent EDF intends to retain control over the grid as will ENEL A phased deregulation of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in August Mergers alliances and consolidation are a dominant theme as companies jockey for position in the new European power market There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross borders as suppliers of new generation as purchasers of assets being spun off by liberalization decrees Italy or because of market concentration rulings in mergers Germany Spain Several international companies have opened trading offices in Europe or Enron Reliant Southern TXU HoustonStreetcom launched a European online wholesale energytrading platform Austria Austrias liberalizing market is facing problems from within and without The EU is dissatisfied with its lack of GTD unbundling although accounts were formally separated in There is no ISO Internally there is intense discussion about an accelerated market opening customers over GWh now have choice Regional utilities are angry over the Verbunds proposal to open of the market in late The Verbund a SOU is the largest generator and owns the transmission grid However it has no retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already deregulated wholesale customers CB White Judith Lezaun Denmark The liberalization law exceeds the EU directives goals and establishes full retail access by Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than GWh in the threshold dropped in April more than GWh the next threshold drops to GWh at the end of The new law includes unbundling of distribution activity and regulated TPA Denmark has recently experienced a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector with large incumbents The trend is moving downstream into distribution and supply Western Denmark is already part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East Denmark is due to join by the end of Energy policy aims at twenty percent of electricity sales would come from renewables by the end of up from a current Cecilia Bergman Finland Finland has been fully open to choice since September when a metering requirement was dropped Prices immediately dropped but only about of households have switched supplier Finland forms part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool The regulator monitors distribution tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place In November the Finnish government launched an IPO for of Fortum the holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy and oil and gas company Neste Oy The Finnish government expects to lower its ownership further The largest new entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall with its acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity Further MA in the distribution and supply sector is expected Cecilia Bergman France There was irony in Frances push for liberalization as it assumed its sixmonth EU presidency France passed its electricity law last February a year after required by EU directive but had odd implementation decrees stalled in the National Assembly However EDF which still controls more than of French generation realized Brussels would hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained closed It recently convinced French authorities to open up of the market by the end of instead of lowering the eligibility threshold to GWhyear from GWh EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from easily entering the energy services market leading EDF to promote a relatively rapid total opening of the French market Corinne Aigroz White Germany While the Electricity Law was officially effective in April real competition is still impeded by complicated TPA grid access conditions especially on the retail market A group of new entrants has organized to call for a governmental regulator Some recent studies have shown the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a massive crosssubsidization between network operations and marketing Recent charges have been made of obstacles to competition by a mulitiplicity of fees including customer switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies In the last months MA among big national and international utilities has redrawn the German utility landscape EDF bought a share in EnBW Veba Viag merged to form EON and RWEVEW merged into RWE Furthermore RWE and EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust authority Currently several utilities are and battling for control of East German VEAG whose transmission connections make it a portal to Eastern Europe Judith Lezaun White Greece According to the FT Greece has hired a consultant us to produce a year plan for state utility PPC PPC is preparing an IPO for of the company theoretically set for but likely later Greece has been given until by the EU to conform to the Directive An IEA report suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector structure First the government should create a clearer separation between itself and the stateowned PPC including a separate regulatory agency Second the government should consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to maximize competition as well as improving market access conditions for IPPs and cogenerators As the countrys largest employer PPC is not likely to effect these changes quickly White Thomas Read Ireland Supply competition was introduced in February for customers over GWh of the market Opening is scheduled to increase to in with further liberalisation in No date for midmarket and full retail opening has been set Incumbent ESB plans to split off its transmission business which will remain stateowned Competition in generation will be introduced in with the auctioning of ESB capacity which is intended to create at least two new players Independent power production has been allowed for two years now Ben Joyce Italy Italy approved its market deregulation decree in March in some measures it goes beyond the EU Directive ENEL had dominated of generation by no entity can control more than or by This requires that ENEL sell between GW and GW of its GW by It has separated GTD into separate legal entities and been privatized A second tranche should take place in A pool mechanism should be operating by Consortia of industrials using more GWhyear can contract directly with IPPs by the threshold will be GWh year The potential free market currently amounts to TWh a year or of total demand This will increase to in ENEL who has a de facto monopoly on TD will retain ownership of the national grid assets a separate staterun ISO GRTN will run transmission and dispatching A pool mechanism operated by a GRTN subsidiary should be operating by in the meantime the market uses bilateral contracts Valentina Grifo White Netherlands By June three of the four large generation companies had been sold to foreign energy groups Competition for large industrial users began in August Large industrials of the market can currently choose their supplier By of the market will be competitive and in there will be full customer choice The Amsterdam Power Exchange modeled along Scandinavian lines was launched in May The APX allows players to trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next day In April it added dayahead prices at border points for Germany although it is not yet much used if successful Belgium would follow In October the government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network TenneT from the four generation companies for million Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase real competition White Karel Tutein Nolthenius Norway Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop in Real retail access got started in when the meter requirement was abolished switching got started in when a switching fee was canceled The current accumulated switching rate lies at Distribution tariffs are regulated and transparent according to rTPA Norway forms part of NordPool Cecilia Bergman Portugal Portugal brought new regulations into force in January They include a pricecap system for determining tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems public and independent Each is locked into supplying the national grid REN a regulated and EdPowned monopoly Producers within the independent system can currently supply eligible customers who consume more than GWhyear at a single site The countrys four discos may purchase up to of consumption outside the public system Portugals regulator ERSE needs either to extend the eligible customers or raise the allowed percent for discos in order to reach the percents required by the Directive The government sold another stake of of stateowned Electricidade de Portugal in October following two successful offerings in and This offering raised billion The state retains and golden share voting rights Rui de Sousa Spain After several major Latin American purchases Endesa moved to restructure and consolidate at home announcing in October the merger with Iberdrola The resulting company would have of the market so it would be forced to shed generation and distribution assets It would also create the worlds th largest utility by market cap There is also movement with the smaller two players The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive providing for full market opening by January Several foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible consumers and there are new generation capacity additions announced by some of the large international Nearly of the market can now choose its supplier A mandatory pool with a bidding system started in Jan White Dominguez Sweden Deregulation was introduced in January with full retail access to all customer groups rTPA and unbundling of distribution activities However switching was impeded by a meter requirement that was abolished in November Switching is currently at but with renegotiated contracts the figure is more like Sweden forms part of NordPool a common electricity market a forum for physical and financial exchanges Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market and an OTC market for financial trading Consolidation has occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation market is concentrated in the hands of large actors Cecilia Bergman Switzerland In October Parliament passed an electricity market law The first phase of the liberalization should start in granting choice to large industrials GWh the midsize market will open in GWh In the law envisions a fully open market Some aspects of the new law such as the transmission tariff model are still being discussed Chris Brombacher White UK With market deregulation complete full choice since May the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply consolidation Seven of the RECs in England Wales are now in joint ownership In the generation market the incumbents share continues to decline National Power and PowerGen have divested further capacity and now stand at and The New Electricity Trading Arrangements for wholesaling have been postponed to early They will allow for a futures and forwards market to trade alongside the established spot market Markets will be run by independent members although the balancing and settlement mechanism will be run by a system operator as before A bilateral power exchange will also be put in and is expected to handle a much larger demand than the spot market Ben Joyce In Central and Eastern Europe privatization initiatives are continuing to attract badly needed capital while the IMF urges reforms as a condition for funding Countries that are looking to EU membership have moved forward with power sector restructuring and gradual opening of their markets to choice Bulgaria In January the Energy Agency announced its intent to unbundle the state monopoly NEK into separate GTD companies NEK will remain a single buyer distribution entities have been merged into seven new companies The unions are opposing rapid reform claiming the necessary regulations have not yet been written The government is working with the IMF to set up financial controls and eliminate crosssubsidies Between and all generation will be upgraded or privatized Transmission will remain stateowned Csilla Ilkei White The Czech Republic In October the Czech government announced it would sell a strategic stake in generator CEZ and in six of the eight regional distributors to a single buyer Privatization is expected to begin in Many Western companies such as Vattenfall and EOn have already been quietly buying up stakes in small municipal distributors who need the cash to balance their budgets A new energy law should be also approved by the end of which would open power markets to competition between and prices should reflect costs by Gas liberalization will follow in CEZ is testing its controversial nuclear plant Temelin which should begin operating by spring CEZ plans to cut wholesale electricity prices by after the commercial launch of Temelin Kristina Kalinova White Hungary Since December majority shares have been sold in the six regional discos and five gencos to Western investors Eastern Europes earliest and most ambitious privatization program has fallen victim to a host of problems especially central government price control AES and IVOTomen tendered new capacity tendered in but AES is now bringing MVM to arbitration over its failure to sign its agreedon PPA Hungary will partially

In September the national electric company Conel was split into four independent units These encompass fossil generation hydro generation transmission and distribution and metering Restructuring precedes eventual privatization which will begin with distribution followed by generation Current law requires foreign owners to have a local partner As Romania is one of the countries invited to join

wanted to privatize significant portions of UES and to lift foreign ownership controls currently at White Slovak Republic In October the government approved a plan to restructure and partially privatize its energy sector implementation legislation needs to be passed The plan would see stateowned Slovenske Elektrarne the GTD monopoly transformed into a stateowned joint stock company Regional distributors will be separated from SE and merged in the first half of into three jointstock companies with a block of shares to be sold Generation will also be separated and transformed into joint

Kalinova Turkey The controversy over BOO buildownoperate vs BOT buildoperatetransfer arrangements for IPPs was resolved in January Turkey passed a retroactive constitutional amendment allowing international arbitration for energy contracts Twentythree BOT projects are affected Turkish economic growth is fueling a need to triple its capacity to GW by In September Turkey proposed an energy law that would separate stateowned TEAS into separate GTD entities Generation plants would eventually be available for privatization while new plants would no longer be transferred to the government but remain with the IPP builder The impetus for this proposed law is Turkeys interest in EU membership only th of its energy regulations meets EU standards White Ukraine Authorities have announced the sale of seven of the countrys regional discos in a transparent tender Such a sale has been unsuccessfully tried before Each sale will be for plus one share The distribution sector is beset with a host of problems including high nonpayment unpaid employees and corruption The EBRD is pushing for progress on privatization before it provides funds to build an alternative to Chernobyl which the authorities have agreed to close Asian economies are recovering from the economic crisis and in some countries electricity demand is returning to precrisis levels Most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans in the power sector although IPPs are facing ongoing problems relating to PPAs and lack of government guarantees Australia All customers in Australia should have choice by Victoria will to phase in full competition during New South Wales NSW has delayed full competition for residential users and small businesses to January The five other states plan to phase in full choice by Victorias five distributors are facing revenue reductions of between and starting in whey they say will hurt their service capability Recent MA activity has seen already privatized Victorian distribution retail and transmission change hands with new owners coming from Asia ElectraNet South Australias SA transco was sold as a year lease in September The National Electricity Market comprising Victoria and NSW started operating in December Queensland SA and ACT will join in the next few years China China is aiming for nationwide interconnection including Hong Kong by Power pooling and increased interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai provinces As there is no process or body in place to oversee reforms some believe that sector reform is a mere slogan Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs following a government decision to cap the ROR for new projects at Another issue is lack of government guarantees China plans to build hundreds of small rural hydro projects and to spend Ynbn to upgrade rural power grids in as part of a project to bring electricity to million people who currently have no access India Five of Indias states have undertaken significant reforms Orissa Haryana Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh And only four of the State Electricity Boards SEBs the principal buyers for independent power are profitable IPP builders have been frustrated by a host of regulations lack of guarantees and SEB insolvencies The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted this year by the withdrawal of two major investors EdF and Cogentrix A draft Electricity Bill will be introduced in Parliament this winter It would create and empower autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions SEBs would be unbundled into GTD and corporatized within four months of passage Initially states would initially retain GD assets they would later be privatized Transmission assets would be put under an independent authority and TPA would be allowed Significantly IPP licensing requirements would be clarified and reduced and largely eliminated for the growing segment of captive producers A key problem of theft as high as of TD losses in some areas would be addressed by strict metering and high penalties The likelihood however of the Bill being passed as proposed is not strong as it faces significant opposition both by unions and regional parties in Parliament Indonesia Indonesias IPP program has faced problems over power purchase costs and project rates of return with bankrupt stateowned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP operators for power Of planned IPP projects only three now supply power six others are ready to generate PLN reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which Paiton will supply energy for months at a rate said to be much lower than the original agreedupon price Other PPA renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss until the Indonesian economy revives and PLNs financial situation improves Unbundling is underway on JavaBali where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries Outside JavaBali unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting to develop rules for a competitive market Japan On March large customers of the market were allowed to choose a supplier This broke the monopolies of the ten regional IOUs for the first time but high transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting true competition Newer liberalization measures in the electricity and gas sectors have since been written an agreement was signed at the July G Summit which provides for fair and transparent nondiscriminatory access to distribution networks in both sectors A number of new companies are entering or planning to enter the market largely set up as JVs with local nonincumbents often offering new products and services In August the government awarded a tender to a nonutility Diamond Power a Mitsubishi unit to supply electricity to the Ministry of Trade and Industry at a rate lower than incumbent TEPCOs TEPCO plans to build a new nuclear plant to cut generation costs and plans to streamline operations in the face of increased competition Malaysia Jamaludin Jarjis was appointed as the new chairman of Tenaga Nasional Berhad TNB in July He assured investors that restructuring begun three years ago by his predecessor would remain intact TNB will be transformed into two separate TD companies by with an equity interest in generation Generation assets have already been separated into TNB Generation thermal generation will be sold The government has approved the construction of more IPPs to meet the demand for electricity which has grown compared to the period before the economic crisis Work on the Bakun Hydro Project in East Malaysia has resumed but it remains to be seen whether the project will go ahead as originally planned or on a smaller scale New Zealand saw ECNZ split into three gencos to create further competition Genesis Power Meridian Energy and Mighty River Power They have been corporatized but will remain under government ownership Legislation passed in forbade ownership of wires noncompetitive and generation and retailing competitive by the same company Companies have until either to sell one business type or to set up a separate trust to own and run the businesses they do not wish to keep By February most had implemented full separation The newly merged NGCTransAlta will be the largest energy retailer in New Zealand with a market cap of NZbillion and more than customers Pakistan Pakistan is trying to attract IPPs with negotiated PPAs which allow fixed ROR of but IPPs face continued lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties Problems continue over Hub Power Company Hubco the largest IPP project in Pakistan Hubco is receiving significantly lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted The government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA was amended in the s making the wholesale power tariff untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco More than of plants have already been sold in a phased selloff of WAPDAs generation Eight parties have been shortlisted for the pending privatization of of Karachi Electric Supply Commission but the sale has been often delayed Philippines An Omnibus Electricity Bill which will set the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor is stalled in a HouseSenate reconciliation committee The Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all financial assistance including million in loans for power related projects until the legislation is passed Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department officials are looking at several alternate options for selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill Governmentappointed advisers have also recommended that Napocor renegotiate some of its takeorpay contracts with IPPs asking some IPPs to reduce power offtake on an interim basis Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these conditions a longer life span for their projects but developers are reluctant to accept because of their own financial commitments Singapore Since initial restructuring and corporatization in and the establishment of a pool in Singapore has lagged in power sector deregulation Investors complain that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for large consumers A thorough review in by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recommended that generation be privatized but with restrictions on generation crossownership transmission and market operation functions be separated and an ISO established and that most retail services be privatized The government has granted two public retail licenses meaning that the two IPPs can sell electricity directly to large users Retail licenses are expected to be issued to the three power generators This will allow full competition for large industrial and commercial customers but retail competition for smaller customers is unlikely to be in place before South Korea South Korea is proceeding with a major restructuring program following government approval in July for stateowned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco Each of the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea Stock Exchange up to foreign ownership will be permitted The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO which will initially retain its TD services Later a UKtype pool will be established where all generators will sell into the pool Competition in distribution and retailing is a longterm target IPP projects totaling MW are already in operation Impending restructuring has not deterred foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs Taiwan Two phases of IPP development have been approved but only one IPP scheme has started up Developers have faced land acquisition problems causing IPP schedules to slip In the government announced plans to launch Phase Three limited to gasfired plants An Electricity Act is before Parliament Its main provisions include privatizing Taipower without unbundling GTD allowing other companies to enter the market as either vertically integrated generation transmission or distribution companies and to pay Taipower a fee for using its facilities and the creation of an independent regulator especially for tariffs IPPs will be able to supply customers at kV and above and IPP prices will not be regulated Thailand The State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid out a threestage process for all stateowned enterprises including power to create fully competitive restructured and privatized sectors A draft Energy Act is under discussion while preparation and implementation of various technical frameworks are underway Under the Act a competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent and independent regulatory body EGAT transferred two thermal units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October EGAT also plans to corporatize and partially privatize its nonhydro plants by Before the economic crisis the government had an ambitious IPP program EGAT now has excess capacity so has delayed many projects Its longterm plans include the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants SPPs using renewable energy PPAs have been signed with SSPs Vietnam Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its power system Electricity of Vietnam EVN is an unbundled state monopoly which does not even service rural customers Local villages provide services to small farmers and small commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards The World Bank has approved a million credit to Vietnam to extend grid electricity to about households scattered throughout the country A few IPPs are trying to win generation projects An Electricity Law due to be enacted in would establish a National Electricity Office for regulation This would replace the existing haphazard villagelevel regulatory system Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations many Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations At the same time ownership limits imposed by several governments limit further investments by companies who have already entered the market According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of Venezuela and Mexico It estimates that million Latin Americans are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to investments And for those who were already open a new development is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either as concessions to build or as full privatizations A big factor impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance on hydropower Serious regionwide droughts during the last few years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors Argentina The big news is in Argentina transmission sector This fall Argentina auctioned off of Transener in an IPO while also offering six lines to the private sector on a BOM buildoperatemaintain basis Endesa Spain must divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to antitrust concerns Endesas two companies are now serving of the countries million people The regulator believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate efficiency and to set prices Brazil Brazils wholesale energy market WEM began operating in October initially only of power bought or sold will go through WEM As other contracts expire it will eventually supervise billion worth of power The WEM intends also to create an internetbased trading system The Brazilian system hydrorun is dependent on plentiful rains to avoid shortages Demand growth has far outstripped GDP while new generation is not keeping pace Analysts predict a shortage in with intermittent brownouts while neighbors are building generation with an eye to exporting power to Brazil Sao Paulo state will sell of CESP Parana one of the last large generation privatizations in December The state is incenting buyers by offering financing for any premium paid over the minimum price of R billion US mil Brazil also conducted a successful action of three transmission lines in August on a buildoperate basis Bolivia Ende Bolivias utility was unbundled in and has been successively sold off through capitalization a stake and management control To meet demand rising at annually the government has ordered these buyers to invest million in the next three years or face losing their concessions they have not fulfilled previous obligations in upgrades Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow distributors to generate up to of demand instead of Chile Privatization in Chile is largely complete Endesas Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the basis for its diversification into telecom via its subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra Partially in response to Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans which will open the distribution market and reduce node unregulated prices from MW to MW Until now transmission charges have been based on existing operating costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also intended to remove control of the grid operation from the generators The proposed changes likely account for Hydro Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for the sale of Transelec in September marked a serious recession and drought seriously affecting hydro generators which represent nearly of Chiles generation Under the existing system generators had no incentive to plan for longterm supply Chile hopes the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to generation and to introduce competition into distribution heretofore a monopoly Colombia Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks against transmission installations have forced the government to postpone the sale of any further power assets including Isagen the state generator ISA the transco as well as regional distributors A March attack for instance caused a blackout in provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or more The government claims to be reassessing the rules but the reality is that the assets would not receive any decent offer now For now million new shares of capital in ISA will be sold to the public at a discount to democratize the power sector Since January of the market has had choice Cuba The first IPP began delivering power to Cubas grid in October In order to curb programmed blackouts it has invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new crude reserves Cuba hopes that of its power will be generated from local fuels by yearend Dominican Republic Blackouts still plague this nation a year after the government split stateowned CDE into separate GTD units Investors paid for a stake and management control of nonhydro generation and of distribution The new government is requiring IPPs who provide of the republics power to renegotiate the terms of the privatization contracts signed with the prior government In the hopes of increasing competition and lowering prices the gencos are planning a power clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to TD companies It will however only function when there is adequate electricity to meet demand Ecuador The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale of its power sector There is a current investment limit of which may need to be raised to The government realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization in order to attract capital Its largest utility EMELEC will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive debts El Salvador In October AES bought Reliants interest in three discos privatized in which together serve of the population CEL the SOU does not plan to privatize its hydro assets or the transmission grid for the moment Guatemala Guatemala sold two major discos in investors have made significant system upgrades State utility INDE still owns of the countrys generation all in hydro It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early s with takeorpay PPAs IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid access The power sector while needing new investment for the next five years may soon be in trouble due to currency devaluation high fuel costs and the effect of the PPAs Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing regulations to their law to encourage more investment Jamaica For the second time in four years the Jamaican government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC which handles all of TD and of the islands generation And for the second time it is Southern who is in the forefront of privatization negotiations It is still not clear what percent will be sold but it seems likely to be a marginal minority of without GTD first being spunoff Mexico The new Fox administration plans to revive electricity reform tabled last year without which energy cannot keep pace with economic growth Fox says there will be no privatizations but an opening of the market Private participation in the distribution sector would require a constitutional change Many believe that constitutional change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms Mexico estimates it needs investments of billion in the power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand reserve margins are at while consumption is growing at annually Without a clear regulatory bill opening the market to competition investment is inhibited IPPs have heretofore been built on a BOO basis Recent tenders have included the option to build either in the US or Mexico with power dedicated to Mexico Nicaragua The privatization of stateowned power company ENEL is underway following its restructuring Assets were first split into GTD companies In September Spains Union Fenosa acquired of two discos for million in an auction in which it was the sole bidder High oil prices forced the government to postpone the October sale of the three gencos two of the three prequalified companies failed to submit final bids Also the political opposition has challenged the legality of the privatization in the Supreme Court Panama Privatization of governmentheld IRHE is now complete of distribution and generation was sold in The government plans to retain control of transmission Foreign investors are involved in building some generation The big news is the Central American integrated grid which should join Guatemala El Salvador Honduras Nicaragua Costa Rica and Panama into a single market by The IADB is running project Peru The new Energy Minister Chamot favors restarting the privatization program stalled since September SOUs mentioned for privatization were six regional energy companies as well as a MW Andean hydro complex Mantaro It was not clear what form privatization would take nor is it clear what will happen now that Fujimori has resigned and fled Peru also announced bids for construction and operation of two transmission lines Currently only large industrials representing of the market have choice There are no plans to expand this Trinidad and Tobago While there has been a partial unbundling of the generation arm of TTEC the government utility retains control of TD as well as of all of natural gas purchases There been neither much IPP nor privatization activity since the sale of of TTEC to Southern and BP Amoco in and the financing of one IPP in Venezuela The Chavez government imposed an electricity restructuring law in August Industrials can choose their supplier but there are no plans to open the market completely A wholesale market is proposed for Venezuela has the lowest tariffs in the Western hemisphere due to high subsidization While the government dithered on privatization plans AES jumped in with a surprise bid for the ADRs of Electricidad de Caracas The government recently announced a tentative sale date of early for of two regional electric companies Enelven and Semda Privatization has oft been postponed most recently because of unknown effects of Venezuelas new electricity law on its rate policy Virgin Islands In September this US territorys Senate quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for an purchase of the Water and Power Authority The Islands could use the money but the Senate objected to the lack of bidding or transparency It was in principle opposed neither to privatization nor to Southern African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their power sectors to foreign investment although most have not moved beyond allowing IPPs Many GulfStates IPPs are for water and power Increasingly power sector forecasts include reliance on the private sector for generation capacity additions Five SubSaharan countries have privatized their power systems Cte dIvoire Gabon Guinea Mali and Senegal A few countries are beginning to discuss partial privatization of the entire governmentowned entity rather than spinning off GTD and undergoing separate privatization Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put pressure on prices due to sustained droughts especially in East Africa Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing restructuring agendas in different countries A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the schemes for regional transmission links The Mozambique Transmission Company links South Africa Mozambique and Swaziland the West African Power Pool will link countries there is a SixCountry link underway between Egypt Jordan Iraq Syria and Turkey and later Lebanon Algeria Interior minister Khelil who as a World Bank official oversaw the restructuring of state oil companies in several countries is committed to a profound restructuring of Sonatrach the NOC and the power sector Sonelgaz Legislation was introduced this summer that would unbundle GTD end Sonelgaz generation monopoly and allow for IPPs on a BOT basis Some of the IPPs are intended for domestic consumption and some for export Algeria is keenly interested in sending power to deregulating European markets via a new undersea link to Spain Ghana With a vast hydroelectric station on the Volta River of Ghanas current power needs are supplied by hydroelectricity Ghanas planned privatization of its distribution company into regional companies is possible in It is implementing a series of power sector reforms designed to provide Ghanaians with universal access to electricity and to transform Ghana into a middleincome country within one generation It is moving to reduce its reliance on hydropower by allowing IPPs to build deisel gas and light crude plants Regionally Ghana is committed to building a West African Power Pool WAPP by expanding electricity generation and interconnections Morocco Two distribution concessions are due to be awarded for Tangiers and Tetouan The concession covers the provision of water sewerage and electrical services to these two northern areas Two earlier powerwater concessions Casablanca Rabat were awarded Morocco has an active IPP program one of the plants was even transferred to the builders after its completion No sale of transmission assets is planned Nigeria The IMF has provided Nigeria a billion facility to encourage reform and to support civilian President Obasnjo In November the government announced plans to privatize ailing NEPA the SOU While a draft electricity policy has been prepared no details have emerged They intend to send regulatory legislation to the parliament by the end of December which should include a framework for foreign IPP investors It is also likely that NEPA will be broken up prior to privatization Enron is supplying MW via bargemounted power facilties off Lagos to ease the power shortages in this oilrich country Senegal Showing how risky foreign investment remains the new Senegalese government has asked Hydro Qubec and Elyo to leave less than two years after they won a interest in state EU Snlec The current government while acknowledging the advances made in rehabilitating old plants cited cronyism on the part of its predecssors South Africa Eskom South Africas parastatal generates of the countrys power and transmits it over national lines to municipal distributors South Africa is moving slowly towards restructuring and unbundling of GTD The fragmented distribution system will be merged into six discos while plants may be grouped into gencos Last year GTD activities were ringfenced to evaluate costs for each business A new structure for the electricity supply industry is being discussed and the possibility of privatizing of Eskoms power stations has been raised for the first time Electricity regulators announced in November that they were considering three bids for the first IPP license to be offered next year While South Africa needs new generation capacity by it now exports power to its neighbors and is very active in the creation of a regional transmission network Eskom has ambitions to be a global player while continuing to focus on its development agenda of rural electrification Eskom Enterprises the unregulated business subsidiary is considering an IPO Egypt In July the Egyptian Electricity Authority was converted into a holding company although still stateowned It intends to offer stakes in seven or eight regional GD companies The sale of Greater Cairo Electricity valued at billion will be first although it has been twice postponed All capacity additions will be solicited competitively as IPPs under the BOOT build own operate transfer model This allows developers to recover construction costs by running a plant while the state eventually owns the project without affecting its debt profile Egypt is part of a planned SixCountry transmission link Israel Israel has been discussing restructuring and privatization for a few years now but no real progress has been made An electricity law passed in March extended the Israel Electric Company IEC license for years in exchange for its accepting of it power needs MW from IPPs and another from foreign developers So far only one IPP has been built Recent offshore gas discoveries have been largely in Palestinian waters further exploration will be necessary before Israel which has no indigenous fuel sources knows whether it will have an assured fuel supply Jordan With virtually no indigenous oil or gas Jordan has been highly dependent on Iraqi oil In early NEPCO the state utility was corporatized and GTD was unbundled Jordans first solicited IPP MW was awarded to Tractebel in May There is talk of relying on IPPs for further generation and of privatizing existing assets Consultants were sought in August to advise Jordan on distribution privatization Jordans transmission grid was linked to Egypt in the link to Syria should be completed soon Kuwait Lifting a freeze on large projects the cabinet has allowed two new IPPs MW MW with possible private financing options Forcasts for power show new MW needed in the next years Lebanon After years of war Lebanon is now engaged in massively rebuilding its infrastructure In April consultants were invited to bid on advising Lebanon on restructuring and eventual privatization of its power sector Lebanon was admitted in May to the planned SixCountry regional transmission linkup Palestine The outlook for Palestines energy independence changed in a moment this Autumn with offshore gas fields in acknowledged Palestinian waters proving substantial It has been nearly totally dependent on Israels IEC for power Qatar Officials announced in February that they had invited five companies to submit proposals for an IPP Foreign developers would hold a stake in a plant envisioned to begin at MW rising later to MW A decision would turn on a bid of less than centskWh to generate power Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabias demand growth has created a need for an additional GW of capacity by much of which will need to come from the private sector Privatization of the sector is being considered as is an unbundling of GTD As a first step in February the ten power companies were merged In April the Saudi Electricity Company was created as a jointstock company governmentowned The consensus among potential investors is that much needs to be done on the regulatory system the financial framework and on tariffs before IPPs become feasible For instance nationals pay only nominal amounts for power Early considerations of BOT projects to meet soaring demand were shelved Tunisia The Parliament passed enabling legislation for independent power in April While the government will continue to control DT and international trade all new generation will be open to the private sector The first IPP for MW is scheduled to come online in It will produce of Tunisias electricity United Arab Emirates The UAE is a confederation of Emirates Political power is concentrated in Abu Dhabi it and Dubai provide over of UAE income In the UAE called for comprehensive restructuring of the powerwater authority and for privatization through IPOs aimed at UAE nationals While privatization in Abu Dhabi is still anticipated Dubai has decided not to privatize these sectors Several IPPs are underway in Abu Dhai and Dubai as both BOO and BOOT The UAEs need for additional power may be met by a grid linking several Gulf States systems which is under discussion between the UAE Oman Saudi Arabia Qatar Kuwait and Bahrain As it is fairly difficult

Secy Goldwyn mac i have a slightly different view on your point the israelis are actually pushing for a palestinian water project as it will greatly strengthen the israeli position in the land settlement discussions in the peace talks the PNA is saying that they need more land in the west bank in order to gain more access to aquifers under the land the isaelis want a desal project for the PNA so that they can claim that the PNA has a larger water base and thus does not need to have more land for access to more water the issue is that there is not practical way in which gaza generated water can efficiently reach the west bank thus a water project in gaza should really be a moot point in this discussion although it will not be due to the lack of rationale to their discussions i think that it is worth pointing out that the US consulate and embassy in israel have been helpful to us from the macro level there needs to be more proactive cooperation between the PNA and GOI on this project due to the logistical and technical reasons that mac pointed out below furthermore it it worth noting that the PNA need to be more willing to adapt their standards to be more in line with large international transactions as the local process that they wish to cling to is very cumbersome and will not benefit the PNA by attracting large scale foreign investment please let me know if you

Secy Goldwyn The IPP in Gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule This combined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in Gaza and the first by a major Western company anywhere in Palestine There are several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the Secretarys visit All equipment for the plant must transit Israel We have been assured by the Israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it is on the list of equipment we provide them That said there are countless opportunities for equipment to be delayed in Israel awaiting clearance whether on the list or not First power could be delayed indefinitely if the Israelis choose to do so for political security or other reasons Fuel for the plant once operational will also transit Israel Again disruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the plug on power in Gaza Gas from Egypt has been discussed it remains to be seen if that will be a reality anytime soon Although not officially from the Israeli government we have been told that as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced the Israelis will turn off supply of electricity to Gaza The current consumption is about MW The first phase of the plant will produce MW This appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby Israel sells Gaza electricity to make up the difference That electricity is likely to be more expensive than that which the plant will supply Enron could well end up being blamed for the higher cost Water is another critical issue The Palestinians want their own supply of fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated Israel is currently selling water to Gaza it is not in Israels best interest to lose this customer therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project OPIC project funding is problematical Since they originally invited Enron to take on this project they should necessarily also be involved Lack of OPIC support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up costs The Israelis must also approve the environmental impact of the plant The plant will meet or exceed World Bank guidelines more so when operating on gas While not a probem at this point the Israelis could delay constructionoperation over environmental concerns Andrew is the lead developer for this project and

being a regulatory issue of interest mcs Forwarded by Mark SchroederLONECT on David NRONDEVELOPMENT To Robbi ES Michelle nron Communications Anthony NRON COMMUNICATIONS cc Wayne GardnerEnron nron Communications Mark CT JaeMoo NRON Craig nron Communications Stephen D NRON Mike DahlkeENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Korea Regulatory Impediment to Bandwidth Trading Action Plan Our regulatory review team in Korea this week has identified a major regulatory impediment to bandwidth trading in Korea This describes the problem and outlines a draft strategy to deal with it with actions shown in blue Problem It appears that under the Telecommunications Business Law as interpreted by the Korea Communications Commission in a recent ruling against MCI a Specific Services Provider Type which we want to be cannot resell International Private Leased Circuits wholesale Only a Facilities Based provider Network Services Provider can do resale of International Leased Lines under the current law We do not want to be a Network Services Provider because an NSP can not exceed foreign ownership and has immense responsibilities Factual Background We want to be a specific services provider Type reseller with facilities such as servers and switches Under the law as interpreted in the recent ruling however SSPs can buy or lease international lines only from NSPs cannot sell International Private Leased Circuits to other SSPs to ValueAdded Service Providers VSPs or to ISPs can sell international capacity only to end users not to other wholesalers The recent ruling came about when MCI not a Network Service Provider leased international lines from an NSP in Korea and resold them to Goldman Sachs for traffic to Hong Kong Korea Telecom brought a case against MCI to the Korea Communications Council KCC for decision Kim and Chang our Enron energy lawyers in Korea handled the case they did not disclose to us that MCI was the client The KCC ruled for KT and against MCI Im not sure yet why Goldman Sachs was treated as a wholesaler and not an end user which should have been legal At this point however the situation is that if a foreign company tried to resell IPLCs wholesale any local NSP could bring a complaint to the KCC and would run the regulatory risk of being forced to cease The sources for this conclusion are Kim and Chang the Ministry of Info and Communications and the Korea Information Society Institute a telecom policy think tank for the Ministry Options Change the law A revision of the law is drafted but does not fix this and changes are closed for this year Amendments on the floor of Parliament are impossible in Korea For a change in law we would have to try in summer to get a change in early Change by Presidential Decree is also possible but is overkill Not feasible Get a new interpretation from the Korea Communications Council that says what we plan to do in Korea in bandwidth is OK We would ask Kim and Chang to present our proposed plans to the KCC before we enter the bandwidth trading BWT market We would describe it in a way that is sufficiently different from the MCI case Jae Moo made this suggestion Pro If we get a favorable ruling we are in business We do not have money at risk unless the regulatory road is clear Con an unfavorable ruling slams the door specifically on us Recommended Steps We should explore this option with Kim and Chang Robbi or Michelle if you agree please contact Kim and Chang to discuss this and authorize start of this work if they agree with this approach I will work with you to develop the scope of work and can operate with Kim and Chang during the work as necessary We will contact MCI to get more facts on their case including whether they were selling to a wholesaler who sold to Goldman or directly to Goldman We can say the Ministry mentioned their case We should probably not be thinking about joint action with MCI at this point as we want to say our case is different if we can I will explore facts with an MCI contact in Tokyo and Craig will do same in Singapore Redefine where a sale of IPLCs takes place to have it not be in Korea Would need legalcommercial creative analysis Possible but uncertain option Redefine the product so as not to be a resale If we buy capacity and chop it up into smaller pieces or alter it before we sell it maybe we are not reselling what we bought But we may still have a problem if the new product is sold to wholesalers Lets explore and above and similar ideas in a conference call Robbi can you set up a call on this with me Donald youMichelle Wayne Gardner Craig Clark Roger Estrada Xi Xi Partnerjv with a local firm already having the NSP status such as KT SK Telecom Dacom etc or become an NSP foreign ownership restirction Huge regulatory filing Not feasible Parallel Actions Take issue up with US Trade Representative telecom in DC Jonathan McHale Also work with local Amcham telecom committee and US Embassy We should do this in parallel with whatever option we choose I will work on this with Steve Burns in DC when we are farther along Work to promote understanding of the merits of BWT for Koreaelsewhere BWT was never contemplated in the laws and regulations All our contacts said BWT needed to be explained more widely in Korea to gain support It is new even to the telecom think tanks We need to do missionary work on this to develop public opinion We need to find a noted PhD economist who is a great communicator who can speak to the think tanks in Korea Singapore Japan etc and give interviews on the merits of BWT for efficiency promoting investment etc This will create the climate for regulators to change I have one possibility in mind but suggestions of names welcome I will propose this separately to Anthony later David
<8940266.1075846220284.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mark.schroeder@enron.com,2000-11-05 02:55:00,Status Report when you get a chance please take time to read David Merrills status report below Frankly I think he is trying his best to get on top of the EBS tasks we have given him HOWEVER having said that and before having received his report below I was going to write you an email indicating that I am afraid we cannot continue to keep David in this role I just returned from Tokyo office opening meetings etc There I saw Sanjay who confirmed his imminent new role for EBS Asia Anthony Duenner President EBS Asia and Bill White head of EBS Asia Trading David simply does not enjoy the confidence of his commercial clients in EBS and notwithstanding my comments above about the level of his effort I do not see turning this around His problem is not any single one thing but a cumulation of things which I list below but I think it is the totality that feeds the general view He was probably only a decent fit with the old Enron APACHI when it was assetfocussed and he could use his diplomatic experience to open doors for projects Even then he was never an Enron person in terms of our culture and being isolated in Singapore has probably not helped to get him inculcated in the company culture With EBS and Enron Asia taking a much more merchant business focus he just does not get it Chris Hunt APACHI and Jim Row exEBS encoureaged him to developpursue origination leads EBS does not want him doing that and the assetfocussed stuff he keeps tossing the way of the enrgy groups is grating to them given that they simply see him as not getting the message that the company has moved away from assets Bill White tells me that he David has not performed well in a meeting It is a single data point but Bill is also known to me from Enron Europe days and he is not a particularly critical person David only exacerbates this by being insecure about his role and trying too hard to sell himself to the clientscustomers internally and they find this teidous Frankly though it is not the only source of Davids problems I think he was illserved by Donald Lassere and XiXi the associate who I am confident conducted what is know here as a whispering campaign ie he does not know what he is doing he is not an expert in the filed and generally acting like a pair of juveniles when it has come to any effort to bring a sense of stability and order to the clients eg dont know what I am supposed to be doing In any event I simply do not see much prospect of persuading the EBS people to give David a chance and I think I will be doing myself no favours with them by pushing it SO either we find another role eg in in Washington and I am nor sure they need someone with Davids skill sets or we let David go Your thoughts In terms of supporting EBS Asia I think the new guy I hired here in London could do it quite capably but all of the biz is either in Houston or I am told Sanjay is contemplating a move to Singapore so in eitheerr case my guy here can probably not be effective from the standpoint of being read into the business From where I am I would prefer to have someone in Singapore or Tokyo rather than Houston but the people in Houston may want someone closer to them I frankly think it is a mistake to try to build a business in Asia from Houston Sanjay mentioned the guy who is his General Counsel at Dabhol Power Company and I will discretely check with Jane Wilson on her impressions but he will not be communications literatespecialised Look forward to your ideas mcs Forwarded by Mark SchroederLONECT on David NRONDEVELOPMENT To Mark CT cc Subject Status Report Mark Here is a status report I met with Anthony Duenner Friday in Korea He approved expenses from his budget for some of the consulting work in Hong Kong that needs to be done Korean work with a law firm to see if we can get a new decision on bandwidth trading continuing expenses of the present tariff consultant in Japan I have done separate emails on and copied to you So that concern is taken care of Everything seems to be going very well so far in the new assignment Thanks for giving me the lead Here is country by country status Korea I went up the learning curve a lot on the Korea trip see sep email on the regulatory problem we discovered and proposed strategy to deal with it I now feel very much on top of Korea Will go back to advance the work on overturning the adverse regulatory ruling To my mind this is exactly what a regulatory review should do identify regulatory risks before we go in Hong Kong We have identified somebody in EBS to do the system configuration report I am going to go up there to advance the tariff submission that is due before year end Japan I need to get up there and get up to speed on what the consultant is doing on tariff and terms and conditions Singapore I am reminding the lawyers to get a corporate entity selected so we can proceed with a license

international activity June November This mailing is a periodic update of the status of international electric power sector privatization and restructuring Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace Governments faced with burgeoning power demands but lacking the funds to meet them are nearly universally opening their generation markets to foreign investors even where privatization is not on the agenda More and more stateowned utilities are unbundling Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the wholesale and retail levels A few international players have scaled back their international investments and shifted substantial portions of their portfolio to less risky markets such as the US or Europe Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive As Asian economies recover most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans After a year in which currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit Latin America a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to restart but at a slower pace This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe AsiaPacific Latin America and the Middle East Africa Maps that summarize the status of restructuring in Europe Asia Latin America and Africa and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits A slippery slope is Exhibit Timelines showing the opening of markets in various countries by region are in Exhibits See attached file Intlmail exhibitsppt February marked the opening of the market to choice for most large EU customers who use over GWh a year This accounts for about a fourth of demand As of EDay neither France nor Italy had passed their proposed enabling legislation While the EU intended for the transmission operator to be independent EDF intends to retain control over the grid as will ENEL A phased deregulation of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in August Mergers alliances and consolidation are a dominant theme as companies jockey for position in the new European power market There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross borders as suppliers of new generation as purchasers of assets being spun off by liberalization decrees Italy or because of market concentration rulings in mergers Germany Spain Several international companies have opened trading offices in Europe or Enron Reliant Southern TXU HoustonStreetcom launched a European online wholesale energytrading platform Austria Austrias liberalizing market is facing problems from within and without The EU is dissatisfied with its lack of GTD unbundling although accounts were formally separated in There is no ISO Internally there is intense discussion about an accelerated market opening customers over GWh now have choice Regional utilities are angry over the Verbunds proposal to open of the market in late The Verbund a SOU is the largest generator and owns the transmission grid However it has no retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already deregulated wholesale customers CB White Judith Lezaun Denmark The liberalization law exceeds the EU directives goals and establishes full retail access by Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than GWh in the threshold dropped in April more than GWh the next threshold drops to GWh at the end of The new law includes unbundling of distribution activity and regulated TPA Denmark has recently experienced a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector with large incumbents The trend is moving downstream into distribution and supply Western Denmark is already part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East Denmark is due to join by the end of Energy policy aims at twenty percent of electricity sales would come from renewables by the end of up from a current Cecilia Bergman Finland Finland has been fully open to choice since September when a metering requirement was dropped Prices immediately dropped but only about of households have switched supplier Finland forms part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool The regulator monitors distribution tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place In November the Finnish government launched an IPO for of Fortum the holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy and oil and gas company Neste Oy The Finnish government expects to lower its ownership further The largest new entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall with its acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity Further MA in the distribution and supply sector is expected Cecilia Bergman France There was irony in Frances push for liberalization as it assumed its sixmonth EU presidency France passed its electricity law last February a year after required by EU directive but had odd implementation decrees stalled in the National Assembly However EDF which still controls more than of French generation realized Brussels would hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained closed It recently convinced French authorities to open up of the market by the end of instead of lowering the eligibility threshold to GWhyear from GWh EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from easily entering the energy services market leading EDF to promote a relatively rapid total opening of the French market Corinne Aigroz White Germany While the Electricity Law was officially effective in April real competition is still impeded by complicated TPA grid access conditions especially on the retail market A group of new entrants has organized to call for a governmental regulator Some recent studies have shown the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a massive crosssubsidization between network operations and marketing Recent charges have been made of obstacles to competition by a mulitiplicity of fees including customer switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies In the last months MA among big national and international utilities has redrawn the German utility landscape EDF bought a share in EnBW Veba Viag merged to form EON and RWEVEW merged into RWE Furthermore RWE and EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust authority Currently several utilities are and battling for control of East German VEAG whose transmission connections make it a portal to Eastern Europe Judith Lezaun White Greece According to the FT Greece has hired a consultant us to produce a year plan for state utility PPC PPC is preparing an IPO for of the company theoretically set for but likely later Greece has been given until by the EU to conform to the Directive An IEA report suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector structure First the government should create a clearer separation between itself and the stateowned PPC including a separate regulatory agency Second the government should consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to maximize competition as well as improving market access conditions for IPPs and cogenerators As the countrys largest employer PPC is not likely to effect these changes quickly White Thomas Read Ireland Supply competition was introduced in February for customers over GWh of the market Opening is scheduled to increase to in with further liberalisation in No date for midmarket and full retail opening has been set Incumbent ESB plans to split off its transmission business which will remain stateowned Competition in generation will be introduced in with the auctioning of ESB capacity which is intended to create at least two new players Independent power production has been allowed for two years now Ben Joyce Italy Italy approved its market deregulation decree in March in some measures it goes beyond the EU Directive ENEL had dominated of generation by no entity can control more than or by This requires that ENEL sell between GW and GW of its GW by It has separated GTD into separate legal entities and been privatized A second tranche should take place in A pool mechanism should be operating by Consortia of industrials using more GWhyear can contract directly with IPPs by the threshold will be GWh year The potential free market currently amounts to TWh a year or of total demand This will increase to in ENEL who has a de facto monopoly on TD will retain ownership of the national grid assets a separate staterun ISO GRTN will run transmission and dispatching A pool mechanism operated by a GRTN subsidiary should be operating by in the meantime the market uses bilateral contracts Valentina Grifo White Netherlands By June three of the four large generation companies had been sold to foreign energy groups Competition for large industrial users began in August Large industrials of the market can currently choose their supplier By of the market will be competitive and in there will be full customer choice The Amsterdam Power Exchange modeled along Scandinavian lines was launched in May The APX allows players to trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next day In April it added dayahead prices at border points for Germany although it is not yet much used if successful Belgium would follow In October the government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network TenneT from the four generation companies for million Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase real competition White Karel Tutein Nolthenius Norway Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop in Real retail access got started in when the meter requirement was abolished switching got started in when a switching fee was canceled The current accumulated switching rate lies at Distribution tariffs are regulated and transparent according to rTPA Norway forms part of NordPool Cecilia Bergman Portugal Portugal brought new regulations into force in January They include a pricecap system for determining tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems public and independent Each is locked into supplying the national grid REN a regulated and EdPowned monopoly Producers within the independent system can currently supply eligible customers who consume more than GWhyear at a single site The countrys four discos may purchase up to of consumption outside the public system Portugals regulator ERSE needs either to extend the eligible customers or raise the allowed percent for discos in order to reach the percents required by the Directive The government sold another stake of of stateowned Electricidade de Portugal in October following two successful offerings in and This offering raised billion The state retains and golden share voting rights Rui de Sousa Spain After several major Latin American purchases Endesa moved to restructure and consolidate at home announcing in October the merger with Iberdrola The resulting company would have of the market so it would be forced to shed generation and distribution assets It would also create the worlds th largest utility by market cap There is also movement with the smaller two players The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive providing for full market opening by January Several foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible consumers and there are new generation capacity additions announced by some of the large international Nearly of the market can now choose its supplier A mandatory pool with a bidding system started in Jan White Dominguez Sweden Deregulation was introduced in January with full retail access to all customer groups rTPA and unbundling of distribution activities However switching was impeded by a meter requirement that was abolished in November Switching is currently at but with renegotiated contracts the figure is more like Sweden forms part of NordPool a common electricity market a forum for physical and financial exchanges Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market and an OTC market for financial trading Consolidation has occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation market is concentrated in the hands of large actors Cecilia Bergman Switzerland In October Parliament passed an electricity market law The first phase of the liberalization should start in granting choice to large industrials GWh the midsize market will open in GWh In the law envisions a fully open market Some aspects of the new law such as the transmission tariff model are still being discussed Chris Brombacher White UK With market deregulation complete full choice since May the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply consolidation Seven of the RECs in England Wales are now in joint ownership In the generation market the incumbents share continues to decline National Power and PowerGen have divested further capacity and now stand at and The New Electricity Trading Arrangements for wholesaling have been postponed to early They will allow for a futures and forwards market to trade alongside the established spot market Markets will be run by independent members although the balancing and settlement mechanism will be run by a system operator as before A bilateral power exchange will also be put in and is expected to handle a much larger demand than the spot market Ben Joyce In Central and Eastern Europe privatization initiatives are continuing to attract badly needed capital while the IMF urges reforms as a condition for funding Countries that are looking to EU membership have moved forward with power sector restructuring and gradual opening of their markets to choice Bulgaria In January the Energy Agency announced its intent to unbundle the state monopoly NEK into separate GTD companies NEK will remain a single buyer distribution entities have been merged into seven new companies The unions are opposing rapid reform claiming the necessary regulations have not yet been written The government is working with the IMF to set up financial controls and eliminate crosssubsidies Between and all generation will be upgraded or privatized Transmission will remain stateowned Csilla Ilkei White The Czech Republic In October the Czech government announced it would sell a strategic stake in generator CEZ and in six of the eight regional distributors to a single buyer Privatization is expected to begin in Many Western companies such as Vattenfall and EOn have already been quietly buying up stakes in small municipal distributors who need the cash to balance their budgets A new energy law should be also approved by the end of which would open power markets to competition between and prices should reflect costs by Gas liberalization will follow in CEZ is testing its controversial nuclear plant Temelin which should begin operating by spring CEZ plans to cut wholesale electricity prices by after the commercial launch of Temelin Kristina Kalinova White Hungary Since December majority shares have been sold in the six regional discos and five gencos to Western investors Eastern Europes earliest and most ambitious privatization program has fallen victim to a host of problems especially central government price control AES and IVOTomen tendered new capacity tendered in but AES is now bringing MVM to arbitration over its failure to sign its agreedon PPA Hungary will partially deregulate its market after but before it joins the EU Further privatization opportunities include a coalfired power plant as well as the monopoly transco MVM Cs Ilkei White Moldova The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has expressed an interest in stakes in privatized assets of Modova giving privatization scheduled for this year a boost Majority shares will be sold in first in five distribution companies then in three generators The first attempt to privatize distribution failed to receive timely bids All companies will require substantial investment for upgrades White Romania In September the national electric company Conel was split into four independent units These encompass fossil generation hydro generation transmission and distribution and metering Restructuring precedes eventual privatization which will begin with distribution followed by generation Current law requires foreign owners to have a local partner As Romania is one of the countries invited to join accession talks with the EU it is opening its market in stages Currently GWh has choice this will rise to GWh next year Evenually elegibility thresholds will be lowered to GWh then GWh Cs IlkeiWhite Russia In the mids the Unified Energy Systems of Russia Joint Stock Company UES also known as RAO was organized into regional joint stock companies UES still holds shares in most of these regional utilities In May President Putin fired the nonreformist energy minister who had blocked earlier attempts at privatization and liberalization The new minister is an unknown quantity The head of UES has wanted to privatize significant portions of UES and to lift foreign ownership controls currently at White Slovak Republic In October the government approved a plan to restructure and partially privatize its energy sector implementation legislation needs to be passed The plan would see stateowned Slovenske Elektrarne the GTD monopoly transformed into a stateowned joint stock company Regional distributors will be separated from SE and merged in the first half of into three jointstock companies with a block of shares to be sold Generation will also be separated and transformed into joint

Kalinova Turkey The controversy over BOO buildownoperate vs BOT buildoperatetransfer arrangements for IPPs was resolved in January Turkey passed a retroactive constitutional amendment allowing international arbitration for energy contracts Twentythree BOT projects are affected Turkish economic growth is fueling a need to triple its capacity to GW by In September Turkey proposed an energy law that would separate stateowned TEAS into separate GTD entities Generation plants would eventually be available for privatization while new plants would no longer be transferred to the government but remain with the IPP builder The impetus for this proposed law is Turkeys interest in EU membership only th of its energy regulations meets EU standards White Ukraine Authorities have announced the sale of seven of the countrys regional discos in a transparent tender Such a sale has been unsuccessfully tried before Each sale will be for plus one share The distribution sector is beset with a host of problems including high nonpayment unpaid employees and corruption The EBRD is pushing for progress on privatization before it provides funds to build an alternative to Chernobyl which the authorities have agreed to close Asian economies are recovering from the economic crisis and in some countries electricity demand is returning to precrisis levels Most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans in the power sector although IPPs are facing ongoing problems relating to PPAs and lack of government guarantees Australia All customers in Australia should have choice by Victoria will to phase in full competition during New South Wales NSW has delayed full competition for residential users and small businesses to January The five other states plan to phase in full choice by Victorias five distributors are facing revenue reductions of between and starting in whey they say will hurt their service capability Recent MA activity has seen already privatized Victorian distribution retail and transmission change hands with new owners coming from Asia ElectraNet South Australias SA transco was sold as a year lease in September The National Electricity Market comprising Victoria and NSW started operating in December Queensland SA and ACT will join in the next few years China China is aiming for nationwide interconnection including Hong Kong by Power pooling and increased interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai provinces As there is no process or body in place to oversee reforms some believe that sector reform is a mere slogan Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs following a government decision to cap the ROR for new projects at Another issue is lack of government guarantees China plans to build hundreds of small rural hydro projects and to spend Ynbn to upgrade rural power grids in as part of a project to bring electricity to million people who currently have no access India Five of Indias states have undertaken significant reforms Orissa Haryana Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh And only four of the State Electricity Boards SEBs the principal buyers for independent power are profitable IPP builders have been frustrated by a host of regulations lack of guarantees and SEB insolvencies The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted this year by the withdrawal of two major investors EdF and Cogentrix A draft Electricity Bill will be introduced in Parliament this winter It would create and empower autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions SEBs would be unbundled into GTD and corporatized within four months of passage Initially states would initially retain GD assets they would later be privatized Transmission assets would be put under an independent authority and TPA would be allowed Significantly IPP licensing requirements would be clarified and reduced and largely eliminated for the growing segment of captive producers A key problem of theft as high as of TD losses in some areas would be addressed by strict metering and high penalties The likelihood however of the Bill being passed as proposed is not strong as it faces significant opposition both by unions and regional parties in Parliament Indonesia Indonesias IPP program has faced problems over power purchase costs and project rates of return with bankrupt stateowned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP operators for power Of planned IPP projects only three now supply power six others are ready to generate PLN reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which Paiton will supply energy for months at a rate said to be much lower than the original agreedupon price Other PPA renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss until the Indonesian economy revives and PLNs financial situation improves Unbundling is underway on JavaBali where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries Outside JavaBali unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting to develop rules for a competitive market Japan On March large customers of the market were allowed to choose a supplier This broke the monopolies of the ten regional IOUs for the first time but high transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting true competition Newer liberalization measures in the electricity and gas sectors have since been written an agreement was signed at the July G Summit which provides for fair and transparent nondiscriminatory access to distribution networks in both sectors A number of new companies are entering or planning to enter the market largely set up as JVs with local nonincumbents often offering new products and services In August the government awarded a tender to a nonutility Diamond Power a Mitsubishi unit to supply electricity to the Ministry of Trade and Industry at a rate lower than incumbent TEPCOs TEPCO plans to build a new nuclear plant to cut generation costs and plans to streamline operations in the face of increased competition Malaysia Jamaludin Jarjis was appointed as the new chairman of Tenaga Nasional Berhad TNB in July He assured investors that restructuring begun three years ago by his predecessor would remain intact TNB will be transformed into two separate TD companies by with an equity interest in generation Generation assets have already been separated into TNB Generation thermal generation will be sold The government has approved the construction of more IPPs to meet the demand for electricity which has grown compared to the period before the economic crisis Work on the Bakun Hydro Project in East Malaysia has resumed but it remains to be seen whether the project will go ahead as originally planned or on a smaller scale New Zealand saw ECNZ split into three gencos to create further competition Genesis Power Meridian Energy and Mighty River Power They have been corporatized but will remain under government ownership Legislation passed in forbade ownership of wires noncompetitive and generation and retailing competitive by the same company Companies have until either to sell one business type or to set up a separate trust to own and run the businesses they do not wish to keep By February most had implemented full separation The newly merged NGCTransAlta will be the largest energy retailer in New Zealand with a market cap of NZbillion and more than customers Pakistan Pakistan is trying to attract IPPs with negotiated PPAs which allow fixed ROR of but IPPs face continued lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties Problems continue over Hub Power Company Hubco the largest IPP project in Pakistan Hubco is receiving significantly lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted The government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA was amended in the s making the wholesale power tariff untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco More than of plants have already been sold in a phased selloff of WAPDAs generation Eight parties have been shortlisted for the pending privatization of of Karachi Electric Supply Commission but the sale has been often delayed Philippines An Omnibus Electricity Bill which will set the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor is stalled in a HouseSenate reconciliation committee The Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all financial assistance including million in loans for power related projects until the legislation is passed Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department officials are looking at several alternate options for selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill Governmentappointed advisers have also recommended that Napocor renegotiate some of its takeorpay contracts with IPPs asking some IPPs to reduce power offtake on an interim basis Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these conditions a longer life span for their projects but developers are reluctant to accept because of their own financial commitments Singapore Since initial restructuring and corporatization in and the establishment of a pool in Singapore has lagged in power sector deregulation Investors complain that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for large consumers A thorough review in by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recommended that generation be privatized but with restrictions on generation crossownership transmission and market operation functions be separated and an ISO established and that most retail services be privatized The government has granted two public retail licenses meaning that the two IPPs can sell electricity directly to large users Retail licenses are expected to be issued to the three power generators This will allow full competition for large industrial and commercial customers but retail competition for smaller customers is unlikely to be in place before South Korea South Korea is proceeding with a major restructuring program following government approval in July for stateowned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco Each of the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea Stock Exchange up to foreign ownership will be permitted The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO which will initially retain its TD services Later a UKtype pool will be established where all generators will sell into the pool Competition in distribution and retailing is a longterm target IPP projects totaling MW are already in operation Impending restructuring has not deterred foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs Taiwan Two phases of IPP development have been approved but only one IPP scheme has started up Developers have faced land acquisition problems causing IPP schedules to slip In the government announced plans to launch Phase Three limited to gasfired plants An Electricity Act is before Parliament Its main provisions include privatizing Taipower without unbundling GTD allowing other companies to enter the market as either vertically integrated generation transmission or distribution companies and to pay Taipower a fee for using its facilities and the creation of an independent regulator especially for tariffs IPPs will be able to supply customers at kV and above and IPP prices will not be regulated Thailand The State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid out a threestage process for all stateowned enterprises including power to create fully competitive restructured and privatized sectors A draft Energy Act is under discussion while preparation and implementation of various technical frameworks are underway Under the Act a competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent and independent regulatory body EGAT transferred two thermal units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October EGAT also plans to corporatize and partially privatize its nonhydro plants by Before the economic crisis the government had an ambitious IPP program EGAT now has excess capacity so has delayed many projects Its longterm plans include the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants SPPs using renewable energy PPAs have been signed with SSPs Vietnam Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its power system Electricity of Vietnam EVN is an unbundled state monopoly which does not even service rural customers Local villages provide services to small farmers and small commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards The World Bank has approved a million credit to Vietnam to extend grid electricity to about households scattered throughout the country A few IPPs are trying to win generation projects An Electricity Law due to be enacted in would establish a National Electricity Office for regulation This would replace the existing haphazard villagelevel regulatory system Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations many Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations At the same time ownership limits imposed by several governments limit further investments by companies who have already entered the market According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of Venezuela and Mexico It estimates that million Latin Americans are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to investments And for those who were already open a new development is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either as concessions to build or as full privatizations A big factor impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance on hydropower Serious regionwide droughts during the last few years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors Argentina The big news is in Argentina transmission sector This fall Argentina auctioned off of Transener in an IPO while also offering six lines to the private sector on a BOM buildoperatemaintain basis Endesa Spain must divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors

fulfilled previous obligations in upgrades Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow distributors to generate up to of demand instead of Chile Privatization in Chile is largely complete Endesas Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the basis for its diversification into telecom via its subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra Partially in response to Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans which will open the distribution market and reduce node unregulated prices from MW to MW Until now transmission charges have been based on existing operating costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also intended to remove control of the grid operation from the generators The proposed changes likely account for Hydro Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for the sale of Transelec in September marked a serious recession and drought seriously affecting hydro generators which represent nearly of Chiles generation Under the existing system generators had no incentive to plan for longterm supply Chile hopes the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to generation and to introduce competition into distribution heretofore a monopoly Colombia Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks against transmission installations have forced the government to postpone the sale of any further power assets including Isagen the state generator ISA the transco as well as regional distributors A March attack for instance caused a blackout in provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or more The government claims to be reassessing the rules but the reality is that the assets would not receive any decent offer now For now million new shares of capital in ISA will be sold to the public at a discount to democratize the power sector Since January of the market has had choice Cuba The first IPP began delivering power to Cubas grid in October In order to curb programmed blackouts it has invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new crude reserves Cuba hopes that of its power will be generated from local fuels by yearend Dominican Republic Blackouts still plague this nation a year after the government split stateowned CDE into separate GTD units Investors paid for a stake and management control of nonhydro generation and of distribution The new government is requiring IPPs who provide of the republics power to renegotiate the terms of the privatization contracts signed with the prior government In the hopes of increasing competition and lowering prices the gencos are planning a power clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to TD companies It will however only function when there is adequate electricity to meet demand Ecuador The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale of its power sector There is a current investment limit of which may need to be raised to The government realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization in order to attract capital Its largest utility EMELEC will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive debts El Salvador In October AES bought Reliants interest in three discos privatized in which

significant system upgrades State utility INDE still owns of the countrys generation all in hydro It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early s with takeorpay PPAs IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid access The power sector while needing new investment for the next five years may soon be in trouble due to currency devaluation high fuel costs and the effect of the PPAs Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing regulations to their law to encourage more investment Jamaica For the second time in four years the Jamaican government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC which handles all of TD and of the islands generation And for the second time it is Southern who is in the forefront of privatization negotiations It is still not clear what percent will be sold but it seems likely to be a marginal minority of without GTD first being spunoff Mexico The new Fox administration plans to revive electricity reform tabled last year without which energy cannot keep pace with economic growth Fox says there will be no privatizations but an opening of the market Private participation in the distribution sector would require a constitutional change Many believe that constitutional change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms Mexico estimates it needs investments of billion in the power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand reserve margins are at while consumption is growing at annually Without a clear regulatory bill opening the market to competition investment is inhibited IPPs have heretofore been built on a BOO basis Recent tenders have included the option to build either in the US or Mexico with power dedicated to Mexico Nicaragua The privatization of stateowned power company ENEL is underway following its restructuring Assets

Senate quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for an purchase of the Water and Power Authority The Islands could use the money but the Senate objected to the lack of bidding or transparency It was in principle opposed neither to privatization nor to Southern African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their power sectors to foreign investment although most have not moved beyond allowing IPPs Many GulfStates IPPs are for water and power Increasingly power sector forecasts include reliance on the private sector for generation capacity additions Five SubSaharan countries have privatized their power systems Cte dIvoire Gabon Guinea Mali and Senegal A few countries are beginning to discuss partial privatization of the entire governmentowned entity rather than spinning off GTD and undergoing separate privatization Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put pressure on prices due to sustained droughts especially in East Africa Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing restructuring agendas in different countries A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the schemes for regional transmission links The Mozambique Transmission Company links South Africa Mozambique and Swaziland the West African Power Pool will link countries there is a SixCountry link underway between Egypt Jordan Iraq Syria and Turkey and later Lebanon Algeria Interior minister Khelil who as a World Bank official oversaw the restructuring of state oil companies in several countries is committed to a profound restructuring of Sonatrach the NOC and the power sector Sonelgaz Legislation was introduced this summer that would unbundle GTD end Sonelgaz generation monopoly and allow for IPPs on a BOT basis Some of the IPPs are intended for domestic consumption and some for export Algeria is keenly interested in sending power to deregulating European markets via a new undersea link to Spain Ghana With a vast hydroelectric station on the Volta River of Ghanas current power needs are supplied by hydroelectricity Ghanas planned privatization of its distribution company into regional companies is possible in It is implementing a series of power sector reforms designed to provide Ghanaians with universal access to electricity and to transform Ghana into a middleincome country within one generation It is moving to reduce its reliance on hydropower by allowing IPPs to build deisel gas and light crude plants Regionally Ghana is committed to building a West African Power Pool WAPP by expanding electricity generation and interconnections Morocco Two distribution concessions are due to be awarded for Tangiers and Tetouan The concession covers the provision of water sewerage and electrical services to these two northern areas Two earlier powerwater concessions Casablanca Rabat were awarded Morocco has an active IPP program one of the plants was even transferred to the builders after its completion No sale of transmission assets is planned Nigeria The IMF has provided Nigeria a billion facility to encourage reform and to support civilian President Obasnjo In November the government announced plans to privatize ailing NEPA the SOU While a draft electricity policy has been prepared no details have emerged They intend to send regulatory legislation to the parliament by the end of December which should include a framework for foreign IPP investors It is also likely that NEPA will be broken up prior to privatization Enron is supplying MW via bargemounted power facilties off Lagos to ease the power shortages in this oilrich country Senegal Showing how risky foreign investment remains the new Senegalese government has asked Hydro Qubec and Elyo to leave less than two years after they won a interest in state EU Snlec The current government while acknowledging the advances made in rehabilitating old plants cited cronyism on the part of its predecssors South Africa Eskom South Africas parastatal generates of the countrys power and transmits it over national lines to municipal distributors South Africa is moving slowly towards restructuring and unbundling of GTD The fragmented distribution system will be merged into six discos while plants may be grouped into gencos Last year GTD activities were ringfenced to evaluate costs for each business A new structure for the electricity supply industry is being discussed and the possibility of privatizing of Eskoms power stations has been raised for the first time Electricity regulators announced in November that they were considering three bids for the first IPP license to be offered next year While South Africa needs new generation capacity by it now exports power to its neighbors and is very active in the creation of a regional transmission network Eskom has ambitions to be a global player while continuing to focus on its development agenda of rural electrification Eskom Enterprises the unregulated business subsidiary is considering an IPO Egypt In July the Egyptian Electricity Authority was converted into a holding company although still stateowned It intends to offer stakes in seven or eight regional GD companies The sale of Greater Cairo Electricity valued at billion will be first although it has been twice postponed All capacity additions will be solicited competitively as IPPs under the BOOT build own operate transfer model This allows developers to recover construction costs by running a plant while the state eventually owns the project without affecting its debt profile Egypt is part of a planned SixCountry transmission link Israel Israel has been discussing restructuring and privatization for a few years now but no real progress has been made An electricity law passed in March extended the Israel Electric Company IEC license for years in exchange for its accepting of it power needs MW from IPPs and another from foreign developers So far only one IPP has been built Recent offshore gas discoveries have been largely in Palestinian waters further exploration will be necessary before Israel which has no indigenous fuel sources knows whether it will have an assured fuel supply Jordan With virtually no indigenous oil or gas Jordan has been highly dependent on Iraqi oil In early NEPCO the state utility was corporatized and GTD was unbundled Jordans first solicited IPP MW was awarded to Tractebel in May There is talk of relying on IPPs for further generation and of privatizing existing assets Consultants were sought in August to advise Jordan on distribution privatization Jordans transmission grid was linked to Egypt in the link to Syria should be completed soon Kuwait Lifting a freeze on large projects the cabinet has allowed two new IPPs MW MW with possible private financing options Forcasts for power show new MW needed in the next years Lebanon After years of war Lebanon is now engaged in massively rebuilding its infrastructure In April consultants were invited to bid on advising Lebanon on restructuring and eventual privatization of its power sector Lebanon was admitted in May to the planned SixCountry regional transmission linkup Palestine The outlook for Palestines energy independence changed in a moment this Autumn with offshore gas fields in acknowledged Palestinian waters proving substantial It has been nearly totally dependent on Israels IEC for power Qatar Officials announced in February that they had invited five companies to submit proposals for an IPP Foreign developers would hold a stake in a plant envisioned to begin at MW rising later to MW A decision would turn on a bid of less than centskWh to generate power Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabias demand growth has created a need for an additional GW of capacity by much of which will need to come from the private sector Privatization of the sector is being considered as is an unbundling of GTD As a first step in February the ten power companies were merged In April the Saudi Electricity Company was created as a jointstock company governmentowned The consensus among potential investors is that much needs to be done on the regulatory system the financial framework and on tariffs before IPPs become feasible For instance nationals pay only nominal amounts for power Early considerations of BOT projects to meet soaring demand were shelved Tunisia The Parliament passed enabling legislation for independent power in April While the government will continue to control DT and international trade all new generation will be open to the private sector The first IPP for MW is scheduled to come online in It will produce of Tunisias electricity United Arab Emirates The UAE is a confederation of Emirates Political power is concentrated in Abu Dhabi it and Dubai provide over of UAE income In the UAE called for comprehensive restructuring of the powerwater authority and for privatization through IPOs aimed at UAE nationals While privatization in Abu Dhabi is still anticipated Dubai has decided not to privatize these sectors Several IPPs are underway in Abu Dhai and Dubai as both BOO and BOOT The

think he is trying his best to get on top of the EBS tasks we have given him HOWEVER having said that and before having received his report below I was going to write you an email indicating that I am afraid we cannot continue to keep David in this role I just returned from Tokyo office opening meetings etc There I saw Sanjay who confirmed his imminent new role for EBS Asia Anthony Duenner President EBS Asia and Bill White head of EBS Asia Trading David simply does not enjoy the confidence of his commercial clients in EBS and notwithstanding my comments above about the level of his effort I do not see turning this around His problem is not any single one thing but a cumulation of things which I list below but I think it is the totality that feeds the general view He was probably only a decent fit with the old Enron APACHI when it was assetfocussed and he could use his diplomatic experience to open doors for projects Even then he was never an Enron person in terms of our culture and being isolated in Singapore has probably not helped to get him inculcated in the company culture With EBS and Enron Asia taking a much more merchant business focus he just does not get it Chris Hunt APACHI and Jim Row exEBS encoureaged him to developpursue origination leads EBS does not want him doing that and the assetfocussed stuff he keeps tossing the way of the enrgy groups is grating to them given that they simply see him as not getting the message that the company has moved away from assets Bill White tells me that he David has not performed well in a meeting It is a single data point but Bill is also known to me from Enron Europe days and he is not a particularly critical person David only exacerbates this by being insecure about his role and trying too hard to sell himself to the clientscustomers internally and they find this teidous Frankly though it is not the only source of Davids problems I think he was illserved by Donald Lassere and XiXi the associate who I am confident conducted what is know here as a whispering campaign ie he does not know what he is doing he is not an expert in the filed and generally acting like a pair of juveniles when it has come to any effort to bring a sense of stability and order to the clients eg dont know what I am supposed to be doing In any event I simply do not see much prospect of persuading the EBS people to give David a chance and I think I will be doing myself no favours with them by pushing it SO either we find another role eg in in Washington and I am nor sure they need someone with Davids skill sets or we let David go Your thoughts In terms of supporting EBS Asia I think the new guy I hired here in London could do it quite capably but all of the biz is either in Houston or I am told Sanjay is contemplating a move to Singapore so in eitheerr case my guy here can probably not be effective from the standpoint of being read into the business From where I am I would prefer to have someone in Singapore or Tokyo rather than Houston but the people in Houston may want someone closer to them I frankly think it is a mistake to try to build a business in Asia from Houston Sanjay mentioned the guy who is his General Counsel at Dabhol Power Company and I will discretely check with Jane Wilson on her impressions but he will not be communications literatespecialised Look forward to your ideas mcs Forwarded by Mark SchroederLONECT on David NRONDEVELOPMENT To Mark CT cc Subject Status Report Mark Here is a status report I met with Anthony Duenner Friday in Korea He approved expenses from his budget for some of the consulting work in Hong Kong that needs to be done Korean work with a law firm to see if we can get a new decision on bandwidth trading continuing expenses of the present tariff consultant in Japan I have done separate emails on and copied to you So that concern is taken care of Everything seems to be going very well so far in the new assignment Thanks for giving me the lead Here is country by country status Korea I went up the learning curve a lot on the Korea trip see sep email on the regulatory problem we discovered and proposed strategy to deal with it I now feel very much on top of Korea Will go back to advance the work on overturning the adverse regulatory ruling To my mind this is exactly what a regulatory review should do identify regulatory risks before we go in Hong Kong We have identified somebody in EBS to do the system configuration report I am going to go up there to advance the tariff submission that is due before year end Japan I need to get up there and get up to speed on what the consultant is doing on tariff and terms and conditions Singapore I am reminding the lawyers to get a corporate entity selected so we can proceed with a license

being a regulatory issue of interest mcs Forwarded by Mark SchroederLONECT on David NRONDEVELOPMENT To Robbi ES Michelle nron Communications Anthony NRON COMMUNICATIONS cc Wayne GardnerEnron nron Communications Mark CT JaeMoo NRON Craig nron Communications Stephen D NRON Mike DahlkeENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Korea Regulatory Impediment to Bandwidth Trading Action Plan Our regulatory review team in Korea this week has identified a major regulatory impediment to bandwidth trading in Korea This describes the problem and outlines a draft strategy to deal with it with actions shown in blue Problem It appears that under the Telecommunications Business Law as interpreted by the Korea Communications Commission in a recent ruling against MCI a Specific Services Provider Type which we want to be cannot resell International Private Leased Circuits wholesale Only a Facilities Based provider Network Services Provider can do resale of International Leased Lines under the current law We do not want to be a Network Services Provider because an NSP can not exceed foreign ownership and has immense responsibilities Factual Background We want to be a specific services provider Type reseller with facilities such as servers and switches Under the law as interpreted in the recent ruling however SSPs can buy or lease international lines only from NSPs cannot sell International Private Leased Circuits to other SSPs to ValueAdded Service Providers VSPs or to ISPs can sell international capacity only to end users not to other wholesalers The recent ruling came about when MCI not a Network Service Provider leased international lines from an NSP in Korea and resold them to Goldman Sachs for traffic to Hong Kong Korea Telecom brought a case against MCI to the Korea Communications Council KCC for decision Kim and Chang our Enron energy lawyers in Korea handled the case they did not disclose to us that MCI was the client The KCC ruled for KT and against MCI Im not sure yet why Goldman Sachs was treated as a wholesaler and not an end user which should have been legal At this point however the situation is that if a foreign company tried to resell IPLCs wholesale any local NSP could bring a complaint to the KCC and would run the regulatory risk of being forced to cease The sources for this conclusion are Kim and Chang the Ministry of Info and Communications and the Korea Information Society Institute a telecom policy think tank for the Ministry Options Change the law A revision of the law is drafted but does not fix this and changes are closed for this year Amendments on the floor of Parliament are impossible in Korea For a change in law we would have to try in summer to get a change in early Change by Presidential Decree is also possible but is overkill Not feasible Get a new interpretation from the Korea Communications Council that says what we plan to do in Korea in bandwidth is OK We would ask Kim and Chang to present our proposed plans to the KCC before we enter the bandwidth trading BWT market We would describe it in a way that is sufficiently different from the MCI case Jae Moo made this suggestion Pro If we get a favorable ruling we are in business We do not have money at risk unless the regulatory road is clear Con an unfavorable ruling slams the door specifically on us Recommended Steps We should explore this option with Kim and Chang Robbi or Michelle if you agree please contact Kim and Chang to discuss this and authorize start of this work if they agree with this approach I will work with you to develop the scope of work and can operate with Kim and Chang during the work as necessary We will contact MCI to get more facts on their case including whether they were selling to a wholesaler who sold to Goldman or directly to Goldman We can say the Ministry mentioned their case We should probably not be thinking about joint action with MCI at this point as we want to say our case is different if we can I will explore facts with an MCI contact in Tokyo and Craig will do same in Singapore Redefine where a sale of IPLCs takes place to have it not be in Korea Would need legalcommercial creative analysis Possible but uncertain option Redefine the product so as not to be a resale If we buy capacity and chop it up into smaller pieces or alter it before we sell it maybe we are not reselling what we bought But we may still have a problem if the new product is sold to wholesalers Lets explore and above and similar ideas in a conference call Robbi can you set up a call on this with me Donald youMichelle Wayne Gardner Craig Clark Roger Estrada Xi Xi Partnerjv with a local firm already having the NSP status such as KT SK Telecom Dacom etc or become an NSP foreign ownership restirction Huge regulatory filing Not feasible Parallel Actions Take issue up with US Trade Representative telecom in DC Jonathan McHale Also work with local Amcham telecom committee and US Embassy We should do this in parallel with whatever option we choose I will work on this with Steve Burns in DC when we are farther along Work to promote understanding of the merits of BWT for Koreaelsewhere BWT was never contemplated in the laws and regulations All our contacts said BWT needed to be explained more widely in Korea to gain support It is new even to the telecom think tanks We need to do missionary work on this to develop public opinion We need to find a noted PhD economist who is a great communicator who can speak to the think tanks in Korea Singapore Japan etc and give interviews on the merits of BWT for efficiency promoting investment etc This will create the climate for regulators to change I have one possibility in mind but suggestions of names welcome I will propose this separately to Anthony later David

international activity June November This mailing is a periodic update of the status of international electric power sector privatization and restructuring Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace Governments faced with burgeoning power demands but lacking the funds to meet them are nearly universally opening their generation markets to foreign investors even where privatization is not on the agenda More and more stateowned utilities are unbundling Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the wholesale and retail levels A few international players have scaled back their international investments and shifted substantial portions of their portfolio to less risky markets such as the US or Europe Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive As Asian economies recover most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans After a year in which currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit Latin America a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to restart but at a slower pace This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe AsiaPacific Latin America and the Middle East Africa Maps that summarize the status of restructuring in Europe Asia Latin America and Africa and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits A slippery slope is Exhibit Timelines showing the opening of markets in various countries by region are in Exhibits See attached file Intlmail exhibitsppt February marked the opening of the market to choice for most large EU customers who use over GWh a year This accounts for about a fourth of demand As of EDay neither France nor Italy had passed their proposed enabling legislation While the EU intended for the transmission operator to be independent EDF intends to retain control over the grid as will ENEL A phased deregulation of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in August Mergers alliances and consolidation are a dominant theme as companies jockey for position in the new European power market There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross borders as suppliers of new generation as purchasers of assets being spun off by liberalization decrees Italy or because of market concentration rulings in mergers Germany Spain Several international companies have opened trading offices in Europe or Enron Reliant Southern TXU HoustonStreetcom launched a European online wholesale energytrading platform Austria Austrias liberalizing market is facing problems from within and without The EU is dissatisfied with its lack of GTD unbundling although accounts were formally separated in There is no ISO Internally there is intense discussion about an accelerated market opening customers over GWh now have choice Regional utilities are angry over the Verbunds proposal to open of the market in late The Verbund a SOU is the largest generator and owns the transmission grid However it has no retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already deregulated wholesale customers CB White Judith Lezaun Denmark The liberalization law exceeds the EU directives goals and establishes full retail access by Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than GWh in the threshold dropped in April more than GWh the next threshold drops to GWh at the end of The new law includes unbundling of distribution activity and regulated TPA Denmark has recently experienced a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector with large incumbents The trend is moving downstream into distribution and supply Western Denmark is already part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East Denmark is due to join by the end of Energy policy aims at twenty percent of electricity sales would come from renewables by the end of up from a current Cecilia Bergman Finland Finland has been fully open to choice since September when a metering requirement was dropped Prices immediately dropped but only about of households have switched supplier Finland forms part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool The regulator monitors distribution tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place In November the Finnish government launched an IPO for of Fortum the holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy and oil and gas company Neste Oy The Finnish government expects to lower its ownership further The largest new entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall with its acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity Further MA in the distribution and supply sector is expected Cecilia Bergman France There was irony in Frances push for liberalization as it assumed its sixmonth EU presidency France passed its electricity law last February a year after required by EU directive but had odd implementation decrees stalled in the National Assembly However EDF which still controls more than of French generation realized Brussels would hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained closed It recently convinced French authorities to open up of the market by the end of instead of lowering the eligibility threshold to GWhyear from GWh EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from easily entering the energy services market leading EDF to promote a relatively rapid total opening of the French market Corinne Aigroz White Germany While the Electricity Law was officially effective in April real competition is still impeded by complicated TPA grid access conditions especially on the retail market A group of new entrants has organized to call for a governmental regulator Some recent studies have shown the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a massive crosssubsidization between network operations and marketing Recent charges have been made of obstacles to competition by a mulitiplicity of fees including customer switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies In the last months MA among big national and international utilities has redrawn the German utility landscape EDF bought a share in EnBW Veba Viag merged to form EON and RWEVEW merged into RWE Furthermore RWE and EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust authority Currently several utilities are and battling for control of East German VEAG whose transmission connections make it a portal to Eastern Europe Judith Lezaun White Greece According to the FT Greece has hired a consultant us to produce a year plan for state utility PPC PPC is preparing an IPO for of the company theoretically set for but likely later Greece has been given until by the EU to conform to the Directive An IEA report suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector structure First the government should create a clearer separation between itself and the stateowned PPC including a separate regulatory agency Second the government should consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to maximize competition as well as improving market access conditions for IPPs and cogenerators As the countrys largest employer PPC is not likely to effect these changes quickly White Thomas Read Ireland Supply competition was introduced in February for customers over GWh of the market Opening is scheduled to increase to in with further liberalisation in No date for midmarket and full retail opening has been set Incumbent ESB plans to split off its transmission business which will remain stateowned Competition in generation will be introduced in with the auctioning of ESB capacity which is intended to create at least two new players Independent power production has been allowed for two years now Ben Joyce Italy Italy approved its market deregulation decree in March in some measures it goes beyond the EU Directive ENEL had dominated of generation by no entity can control more than or by This requires that ENEL sell between GW and GW of its GW by It has separated GTD into separate legal entities and been privatized A second tranche should take place in A pool mechanism should be operating by Consortia of industrials using more GWhyear can contract directly with IPPs by the threshold will be GWh year The potential free market currently amounts to TWh a year or of total demand This will increase to in ENEL who has a de facto monopoly on TD will retain ownership of the national grid assets a separate staterun ISO GRTN will run transmission and dispatching A pool mechanism operated by a GRTN subsidiary should be operating by in the meantime the market uses bilateral contracts Valentina Grifo White Netherlands By June three of the four large generation companies had been sold to foreign energy groups Competition for large industrial users began in August Large industrials of the market can currently choose their supplier By of the market will be competitive and in there will be full customer choice The Amsterdam Power Exchange modeled along Scandinavian lines was launched in May The APX allows players to trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next day In April it added dayahead prices at border points for Germany although it is not yet much used if successful Belgium would follow In October the government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network TenneT from the four generation companies for million Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase real competition White Karel Tutein Nolthenius Norway Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop in Real retail access got started in when the meter requirement was abolished switching got started in when a switching fee was canceled The current accumulated switching rate lies at Distribution tariffs are regulated and transparent according to rTPA Norway forms part of NordPool Cecilia Bergman Portugal Portugal brought new regulations into force in January They include a pricecap system for determining tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems public and independent Each is locked into supplying the national grid REN a regulated and EdPowned monopoly Producers within the independent system can currently supply eligible customers who consume more than GWhyear at a single site The countrys four discos may purchase up to of consumption outside the public system Portugals regulator ERSE needs either to extend the eligible customers or raise the allowed percent for discos in order to reach the percents required by the Directive The government sold another stake of of stateowned Electricidade de Portugal in October following two successful offerings in and This offering raised billion The state retains and golden share voting rights Rui de Sousa Spain After several major Latin American purchases Endesa moved to restructure and consolidate at home announcing in October the merger with Iberdrola The resulting company would have of the market so it would be forced to shed generation and distribution assets It would also create the worlds th largest utility by market cap There is also movement with the smaller two players The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive providing for full market opening by January Several foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible consumers and there are new generation capacity additions announced by some of the large international Nearly of the market can now choose its supplier A mandatory pool with a bidding system started in Jan White Dominguez Sweden Deregulation was introduced in January with full retail access to all customer groups rTPA and unbundling of distribution activities However switching was impeded by a meter requirement that was abolished in November Switching is currently at but with renegotiated contracts the figure is more like Sweden forms part of NordPool a common electricity market a forum for physical and financial exchanges Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market and an OTC market for financial trading Consolidation has occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation market is concentrated in the hands of large actors Cecilia Bergman Switzerland In October Parliament passed an electricity market law The first phase of the liberalization should start in granting choice to large industrials GWh the midsize market will open in GWh In the law envisions a fully open market Some aspects of the new law such as the transmission tariff model are still being discussed Chris Brombacher White UK With market deregulation complete full choice since May the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply consolidation Seven of the RECs in England Wales are now in joint ownership In the generation market the incumbents share continues to decline National Power and PowerGen have divested further capacity and now stand at and The New Electricity Trading Arrangements for wholesaling have been postponed to early They will allow for a futures and forwards market to trade alongside the established spot market Markets will be run by independent members although the balancing and settlement mechanism will be run by a system operator as before A bilateral power exchange will also be put in and is expected to handle a much larger demand than the spot market Ben Joyce In Central and Eastern Europe privatization initiatives are continuing to attract badly needed capital while the IMF urges reforms as a condition for funding Countries that are looking to EU membership have moved forward with power sector restructuring and gradual opening of their markets to choice Bulgaria In January the Energy Agency announced its intent to unbundle the state monopoly NEK into separate GTD companies NEK will remain a single buyer distribution entities have been merged into seven new companies The unions are opposing rapid reform claiming the necessary regulations have not yet been written The government is working with the IMF to set up financial controls and eliminate crosssubsidies Between and all generation will be upgraded or privatized Transmission will remain stateowned Csilla Ilkei White The Czech Republic In October the Czech government announced it would sell a strategic stake in generator CEZ and in six of the eight regional distributors to a single buyer Privatization is expected to begin in Many Western companies such as Vattenfall and EOn have already been quietly buying up stakes in small municipal distributors who need the cash to balance their budgets A new energy law should be also approved by the end of which would open power markets to competition between and prices should reflect costs by Gas liberalization will follow in CEZ is testing its controversial nuclear plant Temelin which should begin operating by spring CEZ plans to cut wholesale electricity prices by after the commercial launch of Temelin Kristina Kalinova White Hungary Since December majority shares have been sold in the six regional discos and five gencos to Western investors Eastern Europes earliest and most ambitious privatization program has fallen victim to a host of problems especially central government price control AES and IVOTomen tendered new capacity tendered in but AES is now bringing MVM to arbitration over its failure to sign its agreedon PPA Hungary will partially

for Reconstruction and Development has expressed an interest in stakes in privatized assets of Modova giving privatization scheduled for this year a boost Majority shares will be sold in first in five distribution companies then in three generators The first attempt to privatize distribution failed to receive timely bids All companies will require substantial investment for upgrades White Romania In September the national electric company Conel was split into four independent units These encompass fossil generation hydro generation transmission and distribution and metering Restructuring precedes eventual privatization which will begin with distribution followed by generation Current law requires foreign owners to have a local partner As Romania is one of the countries invited to join accession talks with the EU it is opening its market in stages Currently GWh has choice this will rise to GWh next year Evenually elegibility thresholds will be lowered to GWh then GWh Cs IlkeiWhite Russia In the mids the Unified Energy Systems of Russia Joint Stock Company UES also known as RAO was organized into regional joint stock companies UES still holds shares in most of these regional utilities In May President Putin fired the nonreformist energy minister who had blocked earlier attempts at privatization and liberalization The new minister is an unknown quantity The head of UES has wanted to privatize significant portions of UES and to lift foreign ownership controls currently at White Slovak Republic In October the government approved a plan to restructure and partially privatize its energy sector implementation legislation needs to be passed The plan would see stateowned Slovenske Elektrarne the GTD monopoly transformed into a stateowned joint stock company Regional distributors will be separated from SE and merged in the first half of into three jointstock companies with a block of shares to be sold Generation will also be separated and transformed into joint

Kalinova Turkey The controversy over BOO buildownoperate vs BOT buildoperatetransfer arrangements for IPPs was resolved in January Turkey passed a retroactive constitutional amendment allowing international arbitration for energy contracts Twentythree BOT projects are affected Turkish economic growth is fueling a need to triple its capacity to GW by In September Turkey proposed an energy law that would separate stateowned TEAS into separate GTD entities Generation plants would eventually be available for privatization while new plants would no longer be transferred to the government but remain with the IPP builder The impetus for this proposed law is Turkeys interest in EU membership only th of its energy regulations meets EU standards White Ukraine Authorities have announced the sale of seven of the countrys regional discos in a transparent tender Such a sale has been unsuccessfully tried before Each sale will be for plus one share The distribution sector is beset with a host of problems including high nonpayment unpaid employees and corruption The EBRD is pushing for progress on privatization before it provides funds to build an alternative to Chernobyl which the authorities have agreed to close Asian economies are recovering from the economic crisis and in some countries electricity demand is returning to precrisis levels Most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans in the power sector although IPPs are facing ongoing problems relating to PPAs and lack of government guarantees Australia All customers in Australia should have choice by Victoria will to phase in full competition during New South Wales NSW has delayed full competition for residential users and small businesses to January The five other states plan to phase in full choice by Victorias five distributors are facing revenue reductions of between and starting in whey they say will hurt their service capability Recent MA activity has seen already privatized Victorian distribution retail and transmission change hands with new owners coming from Asia ElectraNet South Australias SA transco was sold as a year lease in September The National Electricity Market comprising Victoria and NSW started operating in December Queensland SA and ACT will join in the next few years China China is aiming for nationwide interconnection including Hong Kong by Power pooling and increased interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai provinces As there is no process or body in place to oversee reforms some believe that sector reform is a mere slogan Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs following a government decision to cap the ROR for new projects at Another issue is lack of government guarantees China plans to build hundreds of small rural hydro projects and to spend Ynbn to upgrade rural power grids in as part of a project to bring electricity to million people who currently have no access India Five of Indias states have undertaken significant reforms Orissa Haryana Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh And only four of the State Electricity Boards SEBs the principal buyers for independent power are profitable IPP builders have been frustrated by a host of regulations lack of guarantees and SEB insolvencies The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted this year by the withdrawal of two major investors EdF and Cogentrix A draft Electricity Bill will be introduced in Parliament this winter It would create and empower autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions SEBs would be unbundled into GTD and corporatized within four months of passage Initially states would initially retain GD assets they would later be privatized Transmission assets would be put under an independent authority and TPA would be allowed Significantly IPP licensing requirements would be clarified and reduced and largely eliminated for the growing segment of captive producers A key problem of theft as high as of TD losses in some areas would be addressed by strict metering and high penalties The likelihood however of the Bill being passed as proposed is not strong as it faces significant opposition both by unions and regional parties in Parliament Indonesia Indonesias IPP program has faced problems over power purchase costs and project rates of return with bankrupt stateowned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP operators for power Of planned IPP projects only three now supply power six others are ready to generate PLN reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which Paiton will supply energy for months at a rate said to be much lower than the original agreedupon price Other PPA renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss until the Indonesian economy revives and PLNs financial situation improves Unbundling is underway on JavaBali where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries Outside JavaBali unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting to develop rules for a competitive market Japan On March large customers of the market were allowed to choose a supplier This broke the monopolies of the ten regional IOUs for the first time but high transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting true competition Newer liberalization measures in the electricity and gas sectors have since been written an agreement was signed at the July G Summit which provides for fair and transparent nondiscriminatory access to distribution networks in both sectors A number of new companies are entering or planning to enter the market largely set up as JVs with local nonincumbents often offering new products and services In August the government awarded a tender to a nonutility Diamond Power a Mitsubishi unit to supply electricity to the Ministry of Trade and Industry at a rate lower than incumbent TEPCOs TEPCO plans to build a new nuclear plant to cut generation costs and plans to streamline operations in the face of increased competition Malaysia Jamaludin Jarjis was appointed as the new chairman of Tenaga Nasional Berhad TNB in July He assured investors that restructuring begun three years ago by his predecessor would remain intact TNB will be transformed into two separate TD companies by with an equity interest in generation Generation assets have already been separated into TNB Generation thermal generation will be sold The government has approved the construction of more IPPs to meet the demand for electricity which has grown compared to the period before the economic crisis Work on the Bakun Hydro Project in East Malaysia has resumed but it remains to be seen whether the project will go ahead as originally planned or on a smaller scale New Zealand saw ECNZ split into three gencos to create further competition Genesis Power Meridian Energy and Mighty River Power They have been corporatized but will remain under government ownership Legislation passed in forbade ownership of wires noncompetitive and generation and retailing competitive by the same company Companies have until either to sell one business type or to set up a separate trust to own and run the businesses they do not wish to keep By February most had implemented full separation The newly merged NGCTransAlta will be the largest energy retailer in New Zealand with a market cap of NZbillion and more than customers Pakistan Pakistan is trying to attract IPPs with negotiated PPAs which allow fixed ROR of but IPPs face continued lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties Problems continue over Hub Power Company Hubco the largest IPP project in Pakistan Hubco is receiving significantly lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted The government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA was amended in the s making the wholesale power tariff untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco More than of plants have already been sold in a phased selloff of WAPDAs generation Eight parties have been shortlisted for the pending privatization of of Karachi Electric Supply Commission but the sale has been often delayed Philippines An Omnibus Electricity Bill which will set the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor is stalled in a HouseSenate reconciliation committee The Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all financial assistance including million in loans for power related projects until the legislation is passed Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department officials are looking at several alternate options for selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill Governmentappointed advisers have also recommended that Napocor renegotiate some of its takeorpay contracts with IPPs asking some IPPs to reduce power offtake on an interim basis Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these conditions a longer life span for their projects but developers are reluctant to accept because of their own financial commitments Singapore Since initial restructuring and corporatization in and the establishment of a pool in Singapore has lagged in power sector deregulation Investors complain that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for large consumers A thorough review in by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recommended that generation be privatized but with restrictions on generation crossownership transmission and market operation functions be separated and an ISO established and that most retail services be privatized The government has granted two public retail licenses meaning that the two IPPs can sell electricity directly to large users Retail licenses are expected to be issued to the three power generators This will allow full competition for large industrial and commercial customers but retail competition for smaller customers is unlikely to be in place before South Korea South Korea is proceeding with a major restructuring program following government approval in July for stateowned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco Each of the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea Stock Exchange up to foreign ownership will be permitted The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO which will initially retain its TD services Later a UKtype pool will be established where all generators will sell into the pool Competition in distribution and retailing is a longterm target IPP projects totaling MW are already in operation Impending restructuring has not deterred foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs Taiwan Two phases of IPP development have been approved but only one IPP scheme has started up Developers have faced land acquisition problems causing IPP schedules to slip In the government announced plans to launch Phase Three limited to gasfired plants An Electricity Act is before Parliament Its main provisions include privatizing Taipower without unbundling GTD allowing other companies to enter the market as either vertically integrated generation transmission or distribution companies and to pay Taipower a fee for using its facilities and the creation of an independent regulator especially for tariffs IPPs will be able to supply customers at kV and above and IPP prices will not be regulated Thailand The State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid out a threestage process for all stateowned enterprises including power to create fully competitive restructured and privatized sectors A draft Energy Act is under discussion while preparation and implementation of various technical frameworks are underway Under the Act a competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent and independent regulatory body EGAT transferred two thermal units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October EGAT also plans to corporatize and partially privatize its nonhydro plants by Before the economic crisis the government had an ambitious IPP program EGAT now has excess capacity so has delayed many projects Its longterm plans include the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants SPPs using renewable energy PPAs have been signed with SSPs Vietnam Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its power system Electricity of Vietnam EVN is an unbundled state monopoly which does not even service rural customers Local villages provide services to small farmers and small commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards The World Bank has approved a million credit to Vietnam to extend grid electricity to about households scattered throughout the country A few IPPs are trying to win generation projects An Electricity Law due to be enacted in would establish a National Electricity Office for regulation This would replace the existing haphazard villagelevel regulatory system Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations many Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations At the same time ownership limits imposed by several governments limit further investments by companies who have already entered the market According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of Venezuela and Mexico It estimates that million Latin Americans are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to investments And for those who were already open a new development is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either as concessions to build or as full privatizations A big factor impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance on hydropower Serious regionwide droughts during the last few years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors Argentina The big news is in Argentina transmission sector This fall Argentina auctioned off of Transener in an IPO while also offering six lines to the private sector on a BOM buildoperatemaintain basis Endesa Spain must divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to antitrust concerns Endesas two companies are now serving of the countries million people The regulator believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate efficiency and to set prices Brazil Brazils wholesale energy market WEM began operating in October initially only of power bought or sold will go through WEM As other contracts expire it will eventually supervise billion worth of power The WEM intends also to create an internetbased trading system The Brazilian system hydrorun is dependent on plentiful rains to avoid shortages Demand growth has far outstripped GDP while new generation is not keeping pace Analysts predict a shortage in with intermittent brownouts while neighbors are building generation with an eye to exporting power to Brazil Sao Paulo state will sell of CESP Parana one of the last large generation privatizations in December The state is incenting buyers by offering financing for any premium paid over the minimum price of R billion US mil Brazil also conducted a successful action of three transmission lines in August on a buildoperate basis Bolivia Ende Bolivias utility was unbundled in and has been successively sold off through capitalization a stake and management control To meet demand rising at annually the government has ordered these buyers to invest million in the next three years or face losing their concessions they have not fulfilled previous obligations in upgrades Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow distributors to generate up to of demand instead of Chile Privatization in Chile is largely complete Endesas Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the basis for its diversification into telecom via its subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra Partially in response to Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans which will open the distribution market and reduce node unregulated prices from MW to MW Until now transmission charges have been based on existing operating costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also intended to remove control of the grid operation from the generators The proposed changes likely account for Hydro Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for the sale of Transelec in September marked a serious recession and drought seriously affecting hydro generators which represent nearly of Chiles generation Under the existing system generators had no incentive to plan for longterm supply Chile hopes the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to generation and to introduce competition into distribution heretofore a monopoly Colombia Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks against transmission installations have forced the government to postpone the sale of any further power assets including Isagen the state generator ISA the transco as well as regional distributors A March attack for instance caused a blackout in provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or more The government claims to be reassessing the rules but the reality is that the assets would not receive any decent offer now For now million new shares of capital in ISA will be sold to the public at a discount to democratize the power sector Since January of the market has had choice Cuba The first IPP began delivering power to Cubas grid in October In order to curb programmed blackouts it has invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new crude reserves Cuba hopes that of its power will be generated from local fuels by yearend Dominican Republic Blackouts still plague this nation a year after the government split stateowned CDE into separate GTD units Investors paid for a stake and management control of nonhydro generation and of distribution The new government is requiring IPPs who provide of the republics power to renegotiate the terms of the privatization contracts signed with the prior government In the hopes of increasing competition and lowering prices the gencos are planning a power clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to TD companies It will however only function when there is adequate electricity to meet demand Ecuador The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale of its power sector There is a current investment limit of which may need to be raised to The government realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization in order to attract capital Its largest utility EMELEC will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive debts El Salvador In October AES bought Reliants interest in three discos privatized in which together serve of the population CEL the SOU does not plan to privatize its hydro assets or the transmission grid for the moment Guatemala Guatemala sold two major discos in investors have made significant system upgrades State utility INDE still owns of the countrys generation all in hydro It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early s with takeorpay PPAs IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid access The power sector while needing new investment for the next five years may soon be in trouble due to currency devaluation high fuel costs and the effect of the PPAs Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing regulations to their law to encourage more investment Jamaica For the second time in four years the Jamaican government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC which handles all of TD and of the islands generation And for the second time it is Southern who is in the forefront of privatization negotiations It is still not clear what percent will be sold but it seems likely to be a marginal minority of without GTD first being spunoff Mexico The new Fox administration plans to revive electricity reform tabled last year without which energy cannot keep pace with economic growth Fox says there will be no privatizations but an opening of the market Private participation in the distribution sector would require a constitutional change Many believe that constitutional change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms Mexico estimates it needs investments of billion in the power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand reserve margins are at while consumption is growing at annually Without a clear regulatory bill opening the market to competition investment is inhibited IPPs have heretofore been built on a BOO basis Recent tenders have included the option to build either in the US or Mexico with power dedicated to Mexico Nicaragua The privatization of stateowned power company ENEL is underway following its restructuring Assets were first split into GTD companies In September Spains Union Fenosa acquired of two discos for million in an auction in which it was the sole bidder High oil prices forced the government to postpone the October sale of the three gencos two of the three prequalified companies failed to submit final bids Also the political opposition has challenged the legality of the privatization in the Supreme Court Panama Privatization of governmentheld IRHE is now complete of distribution and generation was sold in The government plans to retain control of transmission Foreign investors are involved in building some generation The big news is the Central American integrated grid which should join Guatemala El Salvador Honduras Nicaragua Costa Rica and Panama into a single market by The IADB is running project Peru The new Energy Minister Chamot favors restarting the privatization program stalled since September SOUs mentioned for privatization were six regional energy companies as well as a MW Andean hydro complex Mantaro It was not clear what form privatization would take nor is it clear what will happen now that Fujimori has resigned and fled Peru also announced bids for construction and operation of two transmission lines Currently only large industrials representing of the market have choice There are no plans to expand this Trinidad and Tobago While there has been a partial unbundling of the generation arm of TTEC the government utility retains control of TD as well as of all of natural gas purchases There been neither much IPP nor privatization activity since the sale of of TTEC to Southern and BP Amoco in and the financing of one IPP in Venezuela The Chavez government imposed an electricity restructuring law in August Industrials can choose their supplier but there are no plans to open the market completely A wholesale market is proposed for Venezuela has the lowest tariffs in the Western hemisphere due to high subsidization While the government dithered on privatization plans AES jumped in with a surprise bid for the ADRs of Electricidad de Caracas The government recently announced a tentative sale date of early for of two regional electric companies Enelven and Semda Privatization has oft been postponed most recently because of unknown effects of Venezuelas new electricity law on its rate policy Virgin Islands In September this US territorys Senate quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for an purchase of the Water and Power Authority The Islands could use the money but the Senate objected to the lack of bidding or transparency It was in principle opposed neither to privatization nor to Southern African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their power sectors to foreign investment although most have not moved beyond allowing IPPs Many GulfStates IPPs are for water and power Increasingly power sector forecasts include reliance on the private sector for generation capacity additions Five SubSaharan countries have privatized their power systems Cte dIvoire Gabon Guinea Mali and Senegal A few countries are beginning to discuss partial privatization of the entire governmentowned entity rather than spinning off GTD and undergoing separate privatization Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put pressure on prices due to sustained droughts especially in East Africa Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing restructuring agendas in different countries A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the schemes for regional transmission links The Mozambique Transmission Company links South Africa Mozambique and Swaziland the West African Power Pool will link countries there is a SixCountry link underway between Egypt Jordan Iraq Syria and Turkey and later Lebanon Algeria Interior minister Khelil who as a World Bank official oversaw the restructuring of state oil companies in several countries is committed to a profound restructuring of Sonatrach the NOC and the power sector Sonelgaz Legislation was introduced this summer that would unbundle GTD end Sonelgaz generation monopoly and allow for IPPs on a BOT basis Some of the IPPs are intended for domestic consumption and some for export Algeria is keenly interested in sending power to deregulating European markets via a new undersea link to Spain Ghana With a vast hydroelectric station on the Volta River of Ghanas current power needs are supplied by hydroelectricity Ghanas planned privatization of its distribution company into regional companies is possible in It is implementing a series of power sector reforms designed to provide Ghanaians with universal access to electricity and to transform Ghana into a middleincome country within one generation It is moving to reduce its reliance on hydropower by allowing IPPs to build deisel gas and light crude plants Regionally Ghana is committed to building a West African Power Pool WAPP by expanding electricity generation and interconnections Morocco Two distribution concessions are due to be awarded for Tangiers and Tetouan The concession covers the provision of water sewerage and electrical services to these two northern areas Two earlier powerwater concessions Casablanca Rabat were awarded Morocco has an active IPP program one of the plants was even transferred to the builders after its completion No sale of transmission assets is planned Nigeria The IMF has provided Nigeria a billion facility to encourage reform and to support civilian President Obasnjo In November the government announced plans to privatize ailing NEPA the SOU While a draft electricity policy has been prepared no details have emerged They intend to send regulatory legislation to the parliament by the end of December which should include a framework for foreign IPP investors It is also likely that NEPA will be broken up prior to privatization Enron is supplying MW via bargemounted power facilties off Lagos to ease the power shortages in this oilrich country Senegal Showing how risky foreign investment remains the new Senegalese government has asked Hydro Qubec and Elyo to leave less than two years after they won a interest in state EU Snlec The current government while acknowledging the advances made in rehabilitating old plants cited cronyism on the part of its predecssors South Africa Eskom South Africas parastatal generates of the countrys power and transmits it over national lines to municipal distributors South Africa is moving slowly towards restructuring and unbundling of GTD The fragmented distribution system will be merged into six discos while plants may be grouped into gencos Last year GTD activities were ringfenced to evaluate costs for each business A new structure for the electricity supply industry is being discussed and the possibility of privatizing of Eskoms power stations has been raised for the first time Electricity regulators announced in November that they were considering three bids for the first IPP license to be offered next year While South Africa needs new generation capacity by it now exports power to its neighbors and is very active in the creation of a regional transmission network Eskom has ambitions to be a global player while continuing to focus on its development agenda of rural electrification Eskom Enterprises the unregulated business subsidiary is considering an IPO Egypt In July the Egyptian Electricity Authority was converted into a holding company although still stateowned It intends to offer stakes in seven or eight regional GD companies The sale of Greater Cairo Electricity valued at billion will be first although it has been twice postponed All capacity additions will be solicited competitively as IPPs under the BOOT build own operate transfer model This allows developers to recover construction costs by running a plant while the state eventually owns the project without affecting its debt profile Egypt is part of a planned SixCountry transmission link Israel Israel has been discussing restructuring and privatization for a few years now but no real progress has been made An electricity law passed in March extended the Israel Electric Company IEC license for years in exchange for its accepting of it power needs MW from IPPs and another from foreign developers So far only one IPP has been built Recent offshore gas discoveries have been largely in Palestinian waters further exploration will be necessary before Israel which has no indigenous fuel sources knows whether it will have an assured fuel supply Jordan With virtually no indigenous oil or gas Jordan has been highly dependent on Iraqi oil In early NEPCO the state utility was corporatized and GTD was unbundled Jordans first solicited IPP MW was awarded to Tractebel in May There is talk of relying on IPPs for further generation and of privatizing existing assets Consultants were sought in August to advise Jordan on distribution privatization Jordans transmission grid was linked to Egypt in the link to Syria should be completed soon Kuwait Lifting a freeze on large projects the cabinet has allowed two new IPPs MW MW with possible private financing options Forcasts for power show new MW needed in the next years Lebanon After years of war Lebanon is now engaged in massively rebuilding its infrastructure In April consultants were invited to bid on advising Lebanon on restructuring and eventual privatization of its power sector Lebanon was admitted in May to the planned SixCountry regional transmission linkup Palestine The outlook for Palestines energy independence changed in a moment this Autumn with offshore gas fields in acknowledged Palestinian waters proving substantial It has been nearly totally dependent on Israels IEC for power Qatar Officials announced in February that they had invited five companies to submit proposals for an IPP Foreign developers would hold a stake in a plant envisioned to begin at MW rising later to MW A decision would turn on a bid of less than centskWh to generate power Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabias demand growth has created a need for an additional GW of capacity by much of which will need to come from the private sector Privatization of the sector is being considered as is an unbundling of GTD As a first step in February the ten power companies were merged In April the Saudi Electricity Company was created as a jointstock company governmentowned The consensus among potential investors is that much needs to be done on the regulatory system the financial framework and on tariffs before IPPs become feasible For instance nationals pay only nominal amounts for power Early considerations of BOT projects to meet soaring demand were shelved Tunisia The Parliament passed enabling legislation for independent power in April While the government will continue to control DT and international trade all new generation will be open to the private sector The first IPP for MW is scheduled to come online in It will produce of Tunisias electricity United Arab Emirates The UAE is a confederation of Emirates Political power is concentrated in Abu Dhabi it and Dubai provide over of UAE income In the UAE called for comprehensive restructuring of the powerwater authority and for privatization through IPOs aimed at UAE nationals While privatization in Abu Dhabi is still anticipated Dubai has decided not to privatize these sectors Several IPPs are underway in Abu Dhai and Dubai as both BOO and BOOT The UAEs need for additional power may be met by a grid linking several Gulf States systems which is under discussion between the UAE Oman Saudi Arabia Qatar Kuwait and Bahrain As it is fairly difficult

Secy Goldwyn mac i have a slightly different view on your point the israelis are actually pushing for a palestinian water project as it will greatly strengthen the israeli position in the land settlement discussions in the peace talks the PNA is saying that they need more land in the west bank in order to gain more access to aquifers under the land the isaelis want a desal project for the PNA so that they can claim that the PNA has a larger water base and thus does not need to have more land for access to more water the issue is that there is not practical way in which gaza generated water can efficiently reach the west bank thus a water project in gaza should really be a moot point in this discussion although it will not be due to the lack of rationale to their discussions i think that it is worth pointing out that the US consulate and embassy in israel have been helpful to us from the macro level there needs to be more proactive cooperation between the PNA and GOI on this project due to the logistical and technical reasons that mac pointed out below furthermore it it worth noting that the PNA need to be more willing to adapt their standards to be more in line with large international transactions as the local process that they wish to cling to is very cumbersome and will not benefit the PNA by attracting large scale foreign investment please let me know if you

Secy Goldwyn The IPP in Gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule This combined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in Gaza and the first by a major Western company anywhere in Palestine There are several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the Secretarys visit All equipment for the plant must transit Israel We have been assured by the Israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it is on the list of equipment we provide them That said there are countless opportunities for equipment to be delayed in Israel awaiting clearance whether on the list or not First power could be delayed indefinitely if the Israelis choose to do so for political security or other reasons Fuel for the plant once operational will also transit Israel Again disruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the plug on power in Gaza Gas from Egypt has been discussed it remains to be seen if that will be a reality anytime soon Although not officially from the Israeli government we have been told that as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced the Israelis will turn off supply of electricity to Gaza The current consumption is about MW The first phase of the plant will produce MW This appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby Israel sells Gaza electricity to make up the difference That electricity is likely to be more expensive than that which the plant will supply Enron could well end up being blamed for the higher cost Water is another critical issue The Palestinians want their own supply of fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated Israel is currently selling water to Gaza it is not in Israels best interest to lose this customer therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project OPIC project funding is problematical Since they originally invited Enron to take on this project they should necessarily also be involved Lack of OPIC support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up costs The Israelis must also approve the environmental impact of the plant The plant will meet or exceed World Bank guidelines more so when operating on gas While not a probem at this point the Israelis could delay constructionoperation over environmental concerns Andrew is the lead developer for this project and

think he is trying his best to get on top of the EBS tasks we have given him HOWEVER having said that and before having received his report below I was going to write you an email indicating that I am afraid we cannot continue to keep David in this role I just returned from Tokyo office opening meetings etc There I saw Sanjay who confirmed his imminent new role for EBS Asia Anthony Duenner President EBS Asia and Bill White head of EBS Asia Trading David simply does not enjoy the confidence of his commercial clients in EBS and notwithstanding my comments above about the level of his effort I do not see turning this around His problem is not any single one thing but a cumulation of things which I list below but I think it is the totality that feeds the general view He was probably only a decent fit with the old Enron APACHI when it was assetfocussed and he could use his diplomatic experience to open doors for projects Even then he was never an Enron person in terms of our culture and being isolated in Singapore has probably not helped to get him inculcated in the company culture With EBS and Enron Asia taking a much more merchant business focus he just does not get it Chris Hunt APACHI and Jim Row exEBS encoureaged him to developpursue origination leads EBS does not want him doing that and the assetfocussed stuff he keeps tossing the way of the enrgy groups is grating to them given that they simply see him as not getting the message that the company has moved away from assets Bill White tells me that he David has not performed well in a meeting It is a single data point but Bill is also known to me from Enron Europe days and he is not a particularly critical person David only exacerbates this by being insecure about his role and trying too hard to sell himself to the clientscustomers internally and they find this teidous Frankly though it is not the only source of Davids problems I think he was illserved by Donald Lassere and XiXi the associate who I am confident conducted what is know here as a whispering campaign ie he does not know what he is doing he is not an expert in the filed and generally acting like a pair of juveniles when it has come to any effort to bring a sense of stability and order to the clients eg dont know what I am supposed to be doing In any event I simply do not see much prospect of persuading the EBS people to give David a chance and I think I will be doing myself no favours with them by pushing it SO either we find another role eg in in Washington and I am nor sure they need someone with Davids skill sets or we let David go Your thoughts In terms of supporting EBS Asia I think the new guy I hired here in London could do it quite capably but all of the biz is either in Houston or I am told Sanjay is contemplating a move to Singapore so in eitheerr case my guy here can probably not be effective from the standpoint of being read into the business From where I am I would prefer to have someone in Singapore or Tokyo rather than Houston but the people in Houston may want someone closer to them I frankly think it is a mistake to try to build a business in Asia from Houston Sanjay mentioned the guy who is his General Counsel at Dabhol Power Company and I will discretely check with Jane Wilson on her impressions but he will not be communications literatespecialised Look forward to your ideas

being a regulatory issue of interest mcs Forwarded by Mark SchroederLONECT on David NRONDEVELOPMENT To Robbi ES Michelle nron Communications Anthony NRON COMMUNICATIONS cc Wayne GardnerEnron nron Communications Mark CT JaeMoo NRON Craig nron Communications Stephen D NRON Mike DahlkeENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Korea Regulatory Impediment to Bandwidth Trading Action Plan Our regulatory review team in Korea this week has identified a major regulatory impediment to bandwidth trading in Korea This describes the problem and outlines a draft strategy to deal with it with actions shown in blue Problem It appears that under the Telecommunications Business Law as interpreted by the Korea Communications Commission in a recent ruling against MCI a Specific Services Provider Type which we want to be cannot resell International Private Leased Circuits wholesale Only a Facilities Based provider Network Services Provider can do resale of International Leased Lines under the current law We do not want to be a Network Services Provider because an NSP can not exceed foreign ownership and has immense responsibilities Factual Background We want to be a specific services provider Type reseller with facilities such as servers and switches Under the law as interpreted in the recent ruling however SSPs can buy or lease international lines only from NSPs cannot sell International Private Leased Circuits to other SSPs to ValueAdded Service Providers VSPs or to ISPs can sell international capacity only to end users not to other wholesalers The recent ruling came about when MCI not a Network Service Provider leased international lines from an NSP in Korea and resold them to Goldman Sachs for traffic to Hong Kong Korea Telecom brought a case against MCI to the Korea Communications Council KCC for decision Kim and Chang our Enron energy lawyers in Korea handled the case they did not disclose to us that MCI was the client The KCC ruled for KT and against MCI Im not sure yet why Goldman Sachs was treated as a wholesaler and not an end user which should have been legal At this point however the situation is that if a foreign company tried to resell IPLCs wholesale any local NSP could bring a complaint to the KCC and would run the regulatory risk of being forced to cease The sources for this conclusion are Kim and Chang the Ministry of Info and Communications and the Korea Information Society Institute a telecom policy think tank for the Ministry Options Change the law A revision of the law is drafted but does not fix this and changes are closed for this year Amendments on the floor of Parliament are impossible in Korea For a change in law we would have to try in summer to get a change in early Change by Presidential Decree is also possible but is overkill Not feasible Get a new interpretation from the Korea Communications Council that says what we plan to do in Korea in bandwidth is OK We would ask Kim and Chang to present our proposed plans to the KCC before we enter the bandwidth trading BWT market We would describe it in a way that is sufficiently different from the MCI case Jae Moo made this suggestion Pro If we get a favorable ruling we are in business We do not have money at risk unless the regulatory road is clear Con an unfavorable ruling slams the door specifically on us Recommended Steps We should explore this option with Kim and Chang Robbi or Michelle if you agree please contact Kim and Chang to discuss this and authorize start of this work if they agree with this approach I will work with you to develop the scope of work and can operate with Kim and Chang during the work as necessary We will contact MCI to get more facts on their case including whether they were selling to a wholesaler who sold to Goldman or directly to Goldman We can say the Ministry mentioned their case We should probably not be thinking about joint action with MCI at this point as we want to say our case is different if we can I will explore facts with an MCI contact in Tokyo and Craig will do same in Singapore Redefine where a sale of IPLCs takes place to have it not be in Korea Would need legalcommercial creative analysis Possible but uncertain option Redefine the product so as not to be a resale If we buy capacity and chop it up into smaller pieces or alter it before we sell it maybe we are not reselling what we bought But we may still have a problem if the new product is sold to wholesalers Lets explore and above and similar ideas in a conference call Robbi can you set up a call on this with me Donald youMichelle Wayne Gardner Craig Clark Roger Estrada Xi Xi Partnerjv with a local firm already having the NSP status such as KT SK Telecom Dacom etc or become an NSP foreign ownership restirction Huge regulatory filing Not feasible Parallel Actions Take issue up with US Trade Representative telecom in DC Jonathan McHale Also work with local Amcham telecom committee and US Embassy We should do this in parallel with whatever option we choose I will work on this with Steve Burns in DC when we are farther along Work to promote understanding of the merits of BWT for Koreaelsewhere BWT was never contemplated in the laws and regulations All our contacts said BWT needed to be explained more widely in Korea to gain support It is new even to the telecom think tanks We need to do missionary work on this to develop public opinion We need to find a noted PhD economist who is a great communicator who can speak to the think tanks in Korea Singapore Japan etc and give interviews on the merits of BWT for efficiency promoting investment etc This will create the climate for regulators to change I have one possibility in mind but suggestions of names welcome I will propose this separately to Anthony later David

international activity June November This mailing is a periodic update of the status of international electric power sector privatization and restructuring Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace Governments faced with burgeoning power demands but lacking the funds to meet them are nearly universally opening their generation markets to foreign investors even where privatization is not on the agenda More and more stateowned utilities are unbundling Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the wholesale and retail levels A few international players have scaled back their international investments and shifted substantial portions of their portfolio to less risky markets such as the US or Europe Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive As Asian economies recover most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans After a year in which currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit Latin America a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to restart but at a slower pace This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe AsiaPacific Latin America and the Middle East Africa Maps that summarize the status of restructuring in Europe Asia Latin America and Africa and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits A slippery slope is Exhibit Timelines showing the opening of markets in various countries by region are in Exhibits See attached file Intlmail exhibitsppt February marked the opening of the market to choice for most large EU customers who use over GWh a year This accounts for about a fourth of demand As of EDay neither France nor Italy had passed their proposed enabling legislation While the EU intended for the transmission operator to be independent EDF intends to retain control over the grid as will ENEL A phased deregulation of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in August Mergers alliances and consolidation are a dominant theme as companies jockey for position in the new European power market There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross borders as suppliers of new generation as purchasers of assets being spun off by liberalization decrees Italy or because of market concentration rulings in mergers Germany Spain Several international companies have opened trading offices in Europe or Enron Reliant Southern TXU HoustonStreetcom launched a European online wholesale energytrading platform Austria Austrias liberalizing market is facing problems from within and without The EU is dissatisfied with its lack of GTD unbundling although accounts were formally separated in There is no ISO Internally there is intense discussion about an accelerated market opening customers over GWh now have choice Regional utilities are angry over the Verbunds proposal to open of the market in late The Verbund a SOU is the largest generator and owns the transmission grid However it has no retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already deregulated wholesale customers CB White Judith Lezaun Denmark The liberalization law exceeds the EU directives goals and establishes full retail access by Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than GWh in the threshold dropped in April more than GWh the next threshold drops to GWh at the end of The new law includes unbundling of distribution activity and regulated TPA Denmark has recently experienced a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector with large incumbents The trend is moving downstream into distribution and supply Western Denmark is already part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East Denmark is due to join by the end of Energy policy aims at twenty percent of electricity sales would come from renewables by the end of up from a current Cecilia Bergman Finland Finland has been fully open to choice since September when a metering requirement was dropped Prices immediately dropped but only about of households have switched supplier Finland forms part of the Nordic power exchange NordPool The regulator monitors distribution tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place In November the Finnish government launched an IPO for of Fortum the holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy and oil and gas company Neste Oy The Finnish government expects to lower its ownership further The largest new entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall with its acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity Further MA in the distribution and supply sector is expected Cecilia Bergman France There was irony in Frances push for liberalization as it assumed its sixmonth EU presidency France passed its electricity law last February a year after required by EU directive but had odd implementation decrees stalled in the National Assembly However EDF which still controls more than of French generation realized Brussels would hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained closed It recently convinced French authorities to open up of the market by the end of instead of lowering the eligibility threshold to GWhyear from GWh EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from easily entering the energy services market leading EDF to promote a relatively rapid total opening of the French market Corinne Aigroz White Germany While the Electricity Law was officially effective in April real competition is still impeded by complicated TPA grid access conditions especially on the retail market A group of new entrants has organized to call for a governmental regulator Some recent studies have shown the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a massive crosssubsidization between network operations and marketing Recent charges have been made of obstacles to competition by a mulitiplicity of fees including customer switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies In the last months MA among big national and international utilities has redrawn the German utility landscape EDF bought a share in EnBW Veba Viag merged to form EON and RWEVEW merged into RWE Furthermore RWE and EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust authority Currently several utilities are and battling for control of East German VEAG whose transmission connections make it a portal to Eastern Europe Judith Lezaun White Greece According to the FT Greece has hired a consultant us to produce a year plan for state utility PPC PPC is preparing an IPO for of the company theoretically set for but likely later Greece has been given until by the EU to conform to the Directive An IEA report suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector structure First the government should create a clearer separation between itself and the stateowned PPC including a separate regulatory agency Second the government should consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to maximize competition as well as improving market access conditions for IPPs and cogenerators As the countrys largest employer PPC is not likely to effect these changes quickly White Thomas Read Ireland Supply competition was introduced in February for customers over GWh of the market Opening is scheduled to increase to in with further liberalisation in No date for midmarket and full retail opening has been set Incumbent ESB plans to split off its transmission business which will remain stateowned Competition in generation will be introduced in with the auctioning of ESB capacity which is intended to create at least two new players Independent power production has been allowed for two years now Ben Joyce Italy Italy approved its market deregulation decree in March in some measures it goes beyond the EU Directive ENEL had dominated of generation by no entity can control more than or by This requires that ENEL sell between GW and GW of its GW by It has separated GTD into separate legal entities and been privatized A second tranche should take place in A pool mechanism should be operating by Consortia of industrials using more GWhyear can contract directly with IPPs by the threshold will be GWh year The potential free market currently amounts to TWh a year or of total demand This will increase to in ENEL who has a de facto monopoly on TD will retain ownership of the national grid assets a separate staterun ISO GRTN will run transmission and dispatching A pool mechanism operated by a GRTN subsidiary should be operating by in the meantime the market uses bilateral contracts Valentina Grifo White Netherlands By June three of the four large generation companies had been sold to foreign energy groups Competition for large industrial users began in August Large industrials of the market can currently choose their supplier By of the market will be competitive and in there will be full customer choice The Amsterdam Power Exchange modeled along Scandinavian lines was launched in May The APX allows players to trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next day In April it added dayahead prices at border points for Germany although it is not yet much used if successful Belgium would follow In October the government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network TenneT from the four generation companies for million Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase real competition White Karel Tutein Nolthenius Norway Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop in Real retail access got started in when the meter requirement was abolished switching got started in when a switching fee was canceled The current accumulated switching rate lies at Distribution tariffs are regulated and transparent according to rTPA Norway forms part of NordPool Cecilia Bergman Portugal Portugal brought new regulations into force in January They include a pricecap system for determining tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems public and independent Each is locked into supplying the national grid REN a regulated and EdPowned monopoly Producers within the independent system can currently supply eligible customers who consume more than GWhyear at a single site The countrys four discos may purchase up to of consumption outside the public system Portugals regulator ERSE needs either to extend the eligible customers or raise the allowed percent for discos in order to reach the percents required by the Directive The government sold another stake of of stateowned Electricidade de Portugal in October following two successful offerings in and This offering raised billion The state retains and golden share voting rights Rui de Sousa Spain After several major Latin American purchases Endesa moved to restructure and consolidate at home announcing in October the merger with Iberdrola The resulting company would have of the market so it would be forced to shed generation and distribution assets It would also create the worlds th largest utility by market cap There is also movement with the smaller two players The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive providing for full market opening by January Several foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible consumers and there are new generation capacity additions announced by some of the large international Nearly of the market can now choose its supplier A mandatory pool with a bidding system started in Jan White Dominguez Sweden Deregulation was introduced in January with full retail access to all customer groups rTPA and unbundling of distribution activities However switching was impeded by a meter requirement that was abolished in November Switching is currently at but with renegotiated contracts the figure is more like Sweden forms part of NordPool a common electricity market a forum for physical and financial exchanges Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market and an OTC market for financial trading Consolidation has occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation market is concentrated in the hands of large actors Cecilia Bergman Switzerland In October Parliament passed an electricity market law The first phase of the liberalization should start in granting choice to large industrials GWh the midsize market will open in GWh In the law envisions a fully open market Some aspects of the new law such as the transmission tariff model are still being discussed Chris Brombacher White UK With market deregulation complete full choice since May the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply consolidation Seven of the RECs in England Wales are now in joint ownership In the generation market the incumbents share continues to decline National Power and PowerGen have divested further capacity and now stand at and The New Electricity Trading Arrangements for wholesaling have been postponed to early They will allow for a futures and forwards market to trade alongside the established spot market Markets will be run by independent members although the balancing and settlement mechanism will be run by a system operator as before A bilateral power exchange will also be put in and is expected to handle a much larger demand than the spot market Ben Joyce In Central and Eastern Europe privatization initiatives are continuing to attract badly needed capital while the IMF urges reforms as a condition for funding Countries that are looking to EU membership have moved forward with power sector restructuring and gradual opening of their markets to choice Bulgaria In January the Energy Agency announced its intent to unbundle the state monopoly NEK into separate GTD companies NEK will remain a single buyer distribution entities have been merged into seven new companies The unions are opposing rapid reform claiming the necessary regulations have not yet been written The government is working with the IMF to set up financial controls and eliminate crosssubsidies Between and all generation will be upgraded or privatized Transmission will remain stateowned Csilla Ilkei White The Czech Republic In October the Czech government announced it would sell a strategic stake in generator CEZ and in six of the eight regional distributors to a single buyer Privatization is expected to begin in Many Western companies such as Vattenfall and EOn have already been quietly buying up stakes in small municipal distributors who need the cash to balance their budgets A new energy law should be also approved by the end of which would open power markets to competition between and prices should reflect costs by Gas liberalization will follow in CEZ is testing its controversial nuclear plant Temelin which should begin operating by spring CEZ plans to cut wholesale electricity prices by after the commercial launch of Temelin Kristina Kalinova White Hungary Since December majority shares have been sold in the six regional discos and five gencos to Western investors Eastern Europes earliest and most ambitious privatization program has fallen victim to a host of problems especially central government price control AES and IVOTomen tendered new capacity tendered in but AES is now bringing MVM to arbitration over its failure to sign its agreedon PPA Hungary will partially

for Reconstruction and Development has expressed an interest in stakes in privatized assets of Modova giving privatization scheduled for this year a boost Majority shares will be sold in first in five distribution companies then in three generators The first attempt to privatize distribution failed to receive timely bids All companies will require substantial investment for upgrades White Romania In September the national electric company Conel was split into four independent units These encompass fossil generation hydro generation transmission and distribution and metering Restructuring precedes eventual privatization which will begin with distribution followed by generation Current law requires foreign owners to have a local partner As Romania is one of the countries invited to join accession talks with the EU it is opening its market in stages Currently GWh has choice this will rise to GWh next year Evenually elegibility thresholds will be lowered to GWh then GWh Cs IlkeiWhite Russia In the mids the Unified Energy Systems of Russia Joint Stock Company UES also known as RAO was organized into regional joint stock companies UES still holds shares in most of these regional utilities In May President Putin fired the nonreformist energy minister who had blocked earlier attempts at privatization and liberalization The new minister is an unknown quantity The head of UES has wanted to privatize significant portions of UES and to lift foreign ownership controls currently at White Slovak Republic In October the government approved a plan to restructure and partially privatize its energy sector implementation legislation needs to be passed The plan would see stateowned Slovenske Elektrarne the GTD monopoly transformed into a stateowned joint stock company Regional distributors will be separated from SE and merged in the first half of into three jointstock companies with a block of shares to be sold Generation will also be separated and transformed into joint

Kalinova Turkey The controversy over BOO buildownoperate vs BOT buildoperatetransfer arrangements for IPPs was resolved in January Turkey passed a retroactive constitutional amendment allowing international arbitration for energy contracts Twentythree BOT projects are affected Turkish economic growth is fueling a need to triple its capacity to GW by In September Turkey proposed an energy law that would separate stateowned TEAS into separate GTD entities Generation plants would eventually be available for privatization while new plants would no longer be transferred to the government but remain with the IPP builder The impetus for this proposed law is Turkeys interest in EU membership only th of its energy regulations meets EU standards White Ukraine Authorities have announced the sale of seven of the countrys regional discos in a transparent tender Such a sale has been unsuccessfully tried before Each sale will be for plus one share The distribution sector is beset with a host of problems including high nonpayment unpaid employees and corruption The EBRD is pushing for progress on privatization before it provides funds to build an alternative to Chernobyl which the authorities have agreed to close Asian economies are recovering from the economic crisis and in some countries electricity demand is returning to precrisis levels Most governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling restructuring plans in the power sector although IPPs are facing ongoing problems relating to PPAs and lack of government guarantees Australia All customers in Australia should have choice by Victoria will to phase in full competition during New South Wales NSW has delayed full competition for residential users and small businesses to January The five other states plan to phase in full choice by Victorias five distributors are facing revenue reductions of between and starting in whey they say will hurt their service capability Recent MA activity has seen already privatized Victorian distribution retail and transmission change hands with new owners coming from Asia ElectraNet South Australias SA transco was sold as a year lease in September The National Electricity Market comprising Victoria and NSW started operating in December Queensland SA and ACT will join in the next few years China China is aiming for nationwide interconnection including Hong Kong by Power pooling and increased interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai provinces As there is no process or body in place to oversee reforms some believe that sector reform is a mere slogan Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs following a government decision to cap the ROR for new projects at Another issue is lack of government guarantees China plans to build hundreds of small rural hydro projects and to spend Ynbn to upgrade rural power grids in as part of a project to bring electricity to million people who currently have no access India Five of Indias states have undertaken significant reforms Orissa Haryana Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh And only four of the State Electricity Boards SEBs the principal buyers for independent power are profitable IPP builders have been frustrated by a host of regulations lack of guarantees and SEB insolvencies The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted this year by the withdrawal of two major investors EdF and Cogentrix A draft Electricity Bill will be introduced in Parliament this winter It would create and empower autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions SEBs would be unbundled into GTD and corporatized within four months of passage Initially states would initially retain GD assets they would later be privatized Transmission assets would be put under an independent authority and TPA would be allowed Significantly IPP licensing requirements would be clarified and reduced and largely eliminated for the growing segment of captive producers A key problem of theft as high as of TD losses in some areas would be addressed by strict metering and high penalties The likelihood however of the Bill being passed as proposed is not strong as it faces significant opposition both by unions and regional parties in Parliament Indonesia Indonesias IPP program has faced problems over power purchase costs and project rates of return with bankrupt stateowned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP operators for power Of planned IPP projects only three now supply power six others are ready to generate PLN reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which Paiton will supply energy for months at a rate said to be much lower than the original agreedupon price Other PPA renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss until the Indonesian economy revives and PLNs financial situation improves Unbundling is underway on JavaBali where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries Outside JavaBali unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting to develop rules for a competitive market Japan On March large customers of the market were allowed to choose a supplier This broke the monopolies of the ten regional IOUs for the first time but high transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting true competition Newer liberalization measures in the electricity and gas sectors have since been written an agreement was signed at the July G Summit which provides for fair and transparent nondiscriminatory access to distribution networks in both sectors A number of new companies are entering or planning to enter the market largely set up as JVs with local nonincumbents often offering new products and services In August the government awarded a tender to a nonutility Diamond Power a Mitsubishi unit to supply electricity to the Ministry of Trade and Industry at a rate lower than incumbent TEPCOs TEPCO plans to build a new nuclear plant to cut generation costs and plans to streamline operations in the face of increased competition Malaysia Jamaludin Jarjis was appointed as the new chairman of Tenaga Nasional Berhad TNB in July He assured investors that restructuring begun three years ago by his predecessor would remain intact TNB will be transformed into two separate TD companies by with an equity interest in generation Generation assets have already been separated into TNB Generation thermal generation will be sold The government has approved the construction of more IPPs to meet the demand for electricity which has grown compared to the period before the economic crisis Work on the Bakun Hydro Project in East Malaysia has resumed but it remains to be seen whether the project will go ahead as originally planned or on a smaller scale New Zealand saw ECNZ split into three gencos to create further competition Genesis Power Meridian Energy and Mighty River Power They have been corporatized but will remain under government ownership Legislation passed in forbade ownership of wires noncompetitive and generation and retailing competitive by the same company Companies have until either to sell one business type or to set up a separate trust to own and run the businesses they do not wish to keep By February most had implemented full separation The newly merged NGCTransAlta will be the largest energy retailer in New Zealand with a market cap of NZbillion and more than customers Pakistan Pakistan is trying to attract IPPs with negotiated PPAs which allow fixed ROR of but IPPs face continued lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties Problems continue over Hub Power Company Hubco the largest IPP project in Pakistan Hubco is receiving significantly lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted The government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA was amended in the s making the wholesale power tariff untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco More than of plants have already been sold in a phased selloff of WAPDAs generation Eight parties have been shortlisted for the pending privatization of of Karachi Electric Supply Commission but the sale has been often delayed Philippines An Omnibus Electricity Bill which will set the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor is stalled in a HouseSenate reconciliation committee The Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all financial assistance including million in loans for power related projects until the legislation is passed Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department officials are looking at several alternate options for selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill Governmentappointed advisers have also recommended that Napocor renegotiate some of its takeorpay contracts with IPPs asking some IPPs to reduce power offtake on an interim basis Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these conditions a longer life span for their projects but developers are reluctant to accept because of their own financial commitments Singapore Since initial restructuring and corporatization in and the establishment of a pool in Singapore has lagged in power sector deregulation Investors complain that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for large consumers A thorough review in by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recommended that generation be privatized but with restrictions on generation crossownership transmission and market operation functions be separated and an ISO established and that most retail services be privatized The government has granted two public retail licenses meaning that the two IPPs can sell electricity directly to large users Retail licenses are expected to be issued to the three power generators This will allow full competition for large industrial and commercial customers but retail competition for smaller customers is unlikely to be in place before South Korea South Korea is proceeding with a major restructuring program following government approval in July for stateowned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco Each of the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea Stock Exchange up to foreign ownership will be permitted The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO which will initially retain its TD services Later a UKtype pool will be established where all generators will sell into the pool Competition in distribution and retailing is a longterm target IPP projects totaling MW are already in operation Impending restructuring has not deterred foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs Taiwan Two phases of IPP development have been approved but only one IPP scheme has started up Developers have faced land acquisition problems causing IPP schedules to slip In the government announced plans to launch Phase Three limited to gasfired plants An Electricity Act is before Parliament Its main provisions include privatizing Taipower without unbundling GTD allowing other companies to enter the market as either vertically integrated generation transmission or distribution companies and to pay Taipower a fee for using its facilities and the creation of an independent regulator especially for tariffs IPPs will be able to supply customers at kV and above and IPP prices will not be regulated Thailand The State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid out a threestage process for all stateowned enterprises including power to create fully competitive restructured and privatized sectors A draft Energy Act is under discussion while preparation and implementation of various technical frameworks are underway Under the Act a competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent and independent regulatory body EGAT transferred two thermal units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October EGAT also plans to corporatize and partially privatize its nonhydro plants by Before the economic crisis the government had an ambitious IPP program EGAT now has excess capacity so has delayed many projects Its longterm plans include the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants SPPs using renewable energy PPAs have been signed with SSPs Vietnam Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its power system Electricity of Vietnam EVN is an unbundled state monopoly which does not even service rural customers Local villages provide services to small farmers and small commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards The World Bank has approved a million credit to Vietnam to extend grid electricity to about households scattered throughout the country A few IPPs are trying to win generation projects An Electricity Law due to be enacted in would establish a National Electricity Office for regulation This would replace the existing haphazard villagelevel regulatory system Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations many Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations At the same time ownership limits imposed by several governments limit further investments by companies who have already entered the market According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of Venezuela and Mexico It estimates that million Latin Americans are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to investments And for those who were already open a new development is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either as concessions to build or as full privatizations A big factor impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance on hydropower Serious regionwide droughts during the last few years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors Argentina The big news is in Argentina transmission sector This fall Argentina auctioned off of Transener in an IPO while also offering six lines to the private sector on a BOM buildoperatemaintain basis Endesa Spain must divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to antitrust concerns Endesas two companies are now serving of the countries million people The regulator believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate efficiency and to set prices Brazil Brazils wholesale energy market WEM began operating in October initially only of power bought or sold will go through WEM As other contracts expire it will eventually supervise billion worth of power The WEM intends also to create an internetbased trading system The Brazilian system hydrorun is dependent on plentiful rains to avoid shortages Demand growth has far outstripped GDP while new generation is not keeping pace Analysts predict a shortage in with intermittent brownouts while neighbors are building generation with an eye to exporting power to Brazil Sao Paulo state will sell of CESP Parana one of the last large generation privatizations in December The state is incenting buyers by offering financing for any premium paid over the minimum price of R billion US mil Brazil also conducted a successful action of three transmission lines in August on a buildoperate basis Bolivia Ende Bolivias utility was unbundled in and has been successively sold off through capitalization a stake and management control To meet demand rising at annually the government has ordered these buyers to invest million in the next three years or face losing their concessions they have not fulfilled previous obligations in upgrades Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow distributors to generate up to of demand instead of Chile Privatization in Chile is largely complete Endesas Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the basis for its diversification into telecom via its subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra Partially in response to Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans which will open the distribution market and reduce node unregulated prices from MW to MW Until now transmission charges have been based on existing operating costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also intended to remove control of the grid operation from the generators The proposed changes likely account for Hydro Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for the sale of Transelec in September marked a serious recession and drought seriously affecting hydro generators which represent nearly of Chiles generation Under the existing system generators had no incentive to plan for longterm supply Chile hopes the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to generation and to introduce competition into distribution heretofore a monopoly Colombia Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks against transmission installations have forced the government to postpone the sale of any further power assets including Isagen the state generator ISA the transco as well as regional distributors A March attack for instance caused a blackout in provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or more The government claims to be reassessing the rules but the reality is that the assets would not receive any decent offer now For now million new shares of capital in ISA will be sold to the public at a discount to democratize the power sector Since January of the market has had choice Cuba The first IPP began delivering power to Cubas grid in October In order to curb programmed blackouts it has invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new crude reserves Cuba hopes that of its power will be generated from local fuels by yearend Dominican Republic Blackouts still plague this nation a year after the government split stateowned CDE into separate GTD units Investors paid for a stake and management control of nonhydro generation and of distribution The new government is requiring IPPs who provide of the republics power to renegotiate the terms of the privatization contracts signed with the prior government In the hopes of increasing competition and lowering prices the gencos are planning a power clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to TD companies It will however only function when there is adequate electricity to meet demand Ecuador The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale of its power sector There is a current investment limit of which may need to be raised to The government realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization in order to attract capital Its largest utility EMELEC will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive debts El Salvador In October AES bought Reliants interest in three discos privatized in which together serve of the population CEL the SOU does not plan to privatize its hydro assets or the transmission grid for the moment Guatemala Guatemala sold two major discos in investors have made significant system upgrades State utility INDE still owns of the countrys generation all in hydro It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early s with takeorpay PPAs IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid access The power sector while needing new investment for the next five years may soon be in trouble due to currency devaluation high fuel costs and the effect of the PPAs Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing regulations to their law to encourage more investment Jamaica For the second time in four years the Jamaican government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC which handles all of TD and of the islands generation And for the second time it is Southern who is in the forefront of privatization negotiations It is still not clear what percent will be sold but it seems likely to be a marginal minority of without GTD first being spunoff Mexico The new Fox administration plans to revive electricity reform tabled last year without which energy cannot keep pace with economic growth Fox says there will be no privatizations but an opening of the market Private participation in the distribution sector would require a constitutional change Many believe that constitutional change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms Mexico estimates it needs investments of billion in the power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand reserve margins are at while consumption is growing at annually Without a clear regulatory bill opening the market to competition investment is inhibited IPPs have heretofore been built on a BOO basis Recent tenders have included the option to build either in the US or Mexico with power dedicated to Mexico Nicaragua The privatization of stateowned power company ENEL is underway following its restructuring Assets were first split into GTD companies In September Spains Union Fenosa acquired of two discos for million in an auction in which it was the sole bidder High oil prices forced the government to postpone the October sale of the three gencos two of the three prequalified companies failed to submit final bids Also the political opposition has challenged the legality of the privatization in the Supreme Court Panama Privatization of governmentheld IRHE is now complete of distribution and generation was sold in The government plans to retain control of transmission Foreign investors are involved in

MW Andean hydro complex Mantaro It was not clear what form privatization would take nor is it clear what will happen now that Fujimori has resigned and fled Peru also announced bids for construction and operation of two transmission lines Currently only large industrials representing of the market have choice There are no plans to expand this Trinidad and Tobago While there has been a partial unbundling of the generation arm of TTEC the government utility retains control of TD as well as of all of natural gas purchases There been neither much IPP nor privatization activity since the sale

Enelven and Semda Privatization has oft been postponed most recently because of unknown effects of Venezuelas new electricity law on its rate policy Virgin Islands In September this US territorys Senate quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for an purchase of the Water and Power Authority The Islands could use the money but the Senate objected to the lack of bidding or transparency It was in principle opposed neither to privatization nor to Southern African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their power sectors to foreign investment although most have not moved beyond allowing IPPs Many GulfStates IPPs are for water and power Increasingly power sector forecasts include reliance on the private sector for generation capacity additions Five SubSaharan countries have privatized their power systems Cte dIvoire Gabon Guinea Mali and Senegal A few countries are beginning to discuss partial privatization of the entire governmentowned entity rather than spinning off GTD and undergoing separate privatization Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put pressure on prices due to sustained droughts especially in East Africa Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing restructuring agendas in different countries A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the schemes for regional transmission links The Mozambique Transmission Company links South Africa Mozambique and Swaziland the West African Power Pool will link countries there is a SixCountry link underway between Egypt Jordan Iraq Syria and Turkey and later Lebanon Algeria Interior minister Khelil who as a World Bank official oversaw the restructuring of state oil companies in several countries is committed to a profound restructuring of Sonatrach the NOC and the power sector Sonelgaz Legislation was introduced this summer that would unbundle GTD end Sonelgaz generation monopoly and allow for IPPs on a BOT basis Some of the IPPs are intended for domestic consumption and some for export Algeria is keenly interested in sending power to deregulating European markets via a new undersea link to Spain Ghana With a vast hydroelectric station on the Volta River of Ghanas current power needs are supplied by hydroelectricity Ghanas planned privatization of its distribution company into regional companies is possible in It is implementing a series of power sector reforms designed to provide Ghanaians with universal access to electricity and to transform Ghana into a middleincome country within one generation It is moving to reduce its reliance on hydropower by allowing IPPs to build deisel gas and light crude plants Regionally Ghana is committed to building a West African Power Pool WAPP by expanding electricity generation and interconnections Morocco Two distribution concessions are due to be awarded for Tangiers and Tetouan The concession covers the provision of water sewerage and electrical services to these two northern areas Two earlier powerwater concessions Casablanca Rabat were awarded Morocco has an active IPP program one of the plants was even transferred to the builders after its completion No sale of transmission assets is planned Nigeria The IMF has provided Nigeria a billion facility to encourage reform and to support civilian President Obasnjo In November the government announced plans to privatize ailing NEPA the SOU While a draft electricity policy has been prepared no details have emerged They intend to send regulatory legislation to the parliament by the end of December which should include a framework for foreign IPP investors It is also likely that NEPA will be broken up prior to privatization Enron is supplying MW via bargemounted power facilties off Lagos to ease the power shortages in this oilrich country Senegal Showing how risky foreign investment remains the new Senegalese government has asked Hydro Qubec and Elyo to leave less than two years after they won a interest in state EU Snlec The current government while acknowledging the advances made in rehabilitating old plants cited cronyism on the part of its predecssors South Africa Eskom South Africas parastatal generates of the countrys power and transmits it over national lines to municipal distributors South Africa is moving slowly towards restructuring and unbundling of GTD The fragmented distribution system will be merged into six discos while plants may be grouped into gencos Last year GTD activities were ringfenced to evaluate costs for each business A new structure for the electricity supply industry is being discussed and the possibility of privatizing of Eskoms power stations has been raised for the first time Electricity regulators announced in November that they were considering three bids for the first IPP license to be offered next year While South Africa needs new generation capacity by it now exports power to its neighbors and is very active in the creation of a regional transmission network Eskom has ambitions to be a global player while continuing to focus on its development agenda of rural electrification Eskom Enterprises the unregulated business subsidiary is considering an IPO Egypt In July the Egyptian Electricity Authority was converted into a holding company although still stateowned It intends to offer stakes in seven or eight regional GD companies The sale of Greater Cairo Electricity valued at billion will be first although it has been twice postponed All capacity additions will be solicited competitively as IPPs under the BOOT build own operate transfer model This allows developers to recover construction costs by running a plant while the state eventually owns the project without affecting its debt profile Egypt is part of a planned SixCountry transmission link Israel Israel has been discussing restructuring and privatization for a few years now but no real progress has been made An electricity law passed in March extended the Israel Electric Company IEC license for years in exchange for its accepting of it power needs MW from IPPs and another from foreign developers So far only one IPP has been built Recent offshore gas discoveries have been largely in Palestinian waters further exploration will be necessary before Israel which has no indigenous fuel sources knows whether it will have an assured fuel supply Jordan With virtually no indigenous oil or gas Jordan has been highly dependent on Iraqi oil In early NEPCO the state utility was corporatized and GTD was unbundled Jordans first solicited IPP MW was awarded to Tractebel in May There is talk of relying on IPPs for further generation and of privatizing existing assets Consultants were sought in August to advise Jordan on distribution privatization Jordans transmission grid was linked to Egypt in the link to Syria should be completed soon Kuwait Lifting a freeze on large projects the cabinet has allowed two new IPPs MW MW with possible private financing options Forcasts for power show new MW needed in the next years Lebanon After years of war Lebanon is now engaged in massively rebuilding its infrastructure In April consultants were invited to bid on advising Lebanon on restructuring and eventual privatization of its power sector Lebanon was admitted in May to the planned SixCountry regional transmission linkup Palestine The outlook for Palestines energy independence changed in a moment this Autumn with offshore gas fields in acknowledged Palestinian waters proving substantial It has been nearly totally dependent on Israels IEC for power Qatar Officials announced in February that they had invited five companies to submit proposals for an IPP Foreign developers would hold a stake in a plant envisioned to begin at MW rising later to MW A decision would turn on a bid of less than centskWh to generate power Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabias demand growth has created a need for an additional GW of capacity by much of which will need to come from the private sector Privatization of the sector is being considered as is an unbundling of GTD As a first step in February the ten power companies were merged In April the Saudi Electricity Company was created as a jointstock company governmentowned The consensus among potential investors is that much needs to be done on the regulatory system the financial framework and on tariffs before IPPs become feasible For instance nationals pay only nominal amounts for power Early considerations of BOT projects to meet soaring demand were shelved Tunisia The Parliament passed enabling legislation for independent power in April While the government will continue to control DT and international trade all new generation will be open to the private sector The first IPP for MW is scheduled to come online in It will produce of Tunisias electricity United Arab Emirates The UAE is a confederation of Emirates Political power is concentrated in Abu Dhabi it and Dubai provide over of UAE income In the UAE called for comprehensive restructuring of the powerwater authority and for privatization through IPOs aimed at UAE nationals While privatization in Abu Dhabi is still anticipated Dubai has decided not to privatize these sectors Several IPPs are underway in Abu Dhai and Dubai as both BOO and BOOT The

Secy Goldwyn mac i have a slightly different view on your point the israelis are actually pushing for a palestinian water project as it will greatly strengthen the israeli position in the land settlement discussions in the peace talks the PNA is saying that they need more land in the west bank in order to gain more access to aquifers under the land the isaelis want a desal project for the PNA so that they can claim that the PNA has a larger water base and thus does not need to have more land for access to more water the issue is that there is not practical way in which gaza generated water can efficiently reach the west bank thus a water project in gaza should really be a moot point in this discussion although it will not be due to the lack of rationale to their discussions i think that it is worth pointing out that the US consulate and embassy in israel have been helpful to us from the macro level there needs to be more proactive cooperation between the PNA and GOI on this project due to the logistical and technical reasons that mac pointed out below furthermore it it worth noting that the PNA need to be more willing to adapt their standards to be more in line with large international transactions as the local process that they wish to cling to is very cumbersome and will not benefit the PNA by attracting large scale foreign investment please let me know if you

Secy Goldwyn The IPP in Gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule This combined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in Gaza and the first by a major Western company anywhere in Palestine There are several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the Secretarys visit All equipment for the plant must transit Israel We have been assured by the Israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it is on the list of equipment we provide them That said there are countless opportunities for equipment to be delayed in Israel awaiting clearance whether on the list or not First power could be delayed indefinitely if the Israelis choose to do so for political security or other reasons Fuel for the plant once operational will also transit Israel Again disruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the plug on power in Gaza Gas from Egypt has been discussed it remains to be seen if that will be a reality anytime soon Although not officially from the Israeli government we have been told that as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced the Israelis will turn off supply of electricity to Gaza The current consumption is about MW The first phase of the plant will produce MW This appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby Israel sells Gaza electricity to make up the difference That electricity is likely to be more expensive than that which the plant will supply Enron could well end up being blamed for the higher cost Water is another critical issue The Palestinians want their own supply of fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated Israel is currently selling water to Gaza it is not in Israels best interest to lose this customer therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project OPIC project funding is problematical Since they originally invited Enron to take on this project they should necessarily also be involved Lack of OPIC support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up costs The Israelis must also approve the environmental impact of the plant The plant will meet or exceed World Bank guidelines more so when operating on gas While not a probem at this point the Israelis could delay constructionoperation over environmental concerns Andrew is the lead developer for this project and

think he is trying his best to get on top of the EBS tasks we have given him HOWEVER having said that and before having received his report below I was going to write you an email indicating that I am afraid we cannot continue to keep David in this role I just returned from Tokyo office opening meetings etc There I saw Sanjay who confirmed his imminent new role for EBS Asia Anthony Duenner President EBS Asia and Bill White head of EBS Asia Trading David simply does not enjoy the confidence of his commercial clients in EBS and notwithstanding my comments above about the level of his effort I do not see turning this around His problem is not any single one thing but a cumulation of things which I list below but I think it is the totality that feeds the general view He was probably only a decent fit with the old Enron APACHI when it was assetfocussed and he could use his diplomatic experience to open doors for projects Even then he was never an Enron person in terms of our culture and being isolated in Singapore has probably not helped to get him inculcated in the company culture With EBS and Enron Asia taking a much more merchant business focus he just does not get it Chris Hunt APACHI and Jim Row exEBS encoureaged him to developpursue origination leads EBS does not want him doing that and the assetfocussed stuff he keeps tossing the way of the enrgy groups is grating to them given that they simply see him as not getting the message that the company has moved away from assets Bill White tells me that he David has not performed well in a meeting It is a single data point but Bill is also known to me from Enron Europe days and he is not a particularly critical person David only exacerbates this by being insecure about his role and trying too hard to sell himself to the clientscustomers internally and they find this teidous Frankly though it is not the only source of Davids problems I think he was illserved by Donald Lassere and XiXi the associate who I am confident conducted what is know here as a whispering campaign ie he does not know what he is doing he is not an expert in the filed and generally acting like a pair of juveniles when it has come to any effort to bring a sense of stability and order to the clients eg dont know what I am supposed to be doing In any event I simply do not see much prospect of persuading the EBS people to give David a chance and I think I will be doing myself no favours with them by pushing it SO either we find another role eg in in Washington and I am nor sure they need someone with Davids skill sets or we let David go Your thoughts In terms of supporting EBS Asia I think the new guy I hired here in London could do it quite capably but all of the biz is either in Houston or I am told Sanjay is contemplating a move to Singapore so in eitheerr case my guy here can probably not be effective from the standpoint of being read into the business From where I am I would prefer to have someone in Singapore or Tokyo rather than Houston but the people in Houston may want someone closer to them I frankly think it is a mistake to try to build a business in Asia from Houston Sanjay mentioned the guy who is his General Counsel at Dabhol Power Company and I will discretely check with Jane Wilson on her impressions but he will not be communications literatespecialised Look forward to your ideas

Here is country by country status Korea I went up the learning curve a lot on the Korea trip see sep email on the regulatory problem we discovered and proposed strategy to deal with it I now feel very much on top of Korea Will go back to advance the work on overturning the adverse regulatory ruling To my mind this is exactly what a regulatory review should do identify regulatory risks before we go

there and get up to speed on what the consultant is doing on tariff and terms and conditions Singapore I am reminding the lawyers to get a corporate entity selected so we can proceed with a license

scaled back their international investments and shifted substantial portions of their portfolio to less risky markets such as the US or Europe Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU

While the Electricity Law was officially effective in April real competition is still impeded by complicated TPA grid access conditions especially on the retail market A group of new entrants has

marketing Recent charges have been made of obstacles to competition by a mulitiplicity of fees including customer switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies In the last months MA among big national and international utilities has redrawn the German utility landscape EDF bought a share in EnBW Veba Viag merged to form EON and RWEVEW merged into RWE Furthermore RWE and EON must

later Greece has been given until by the EU to conform to the Directive An IEA report suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector structure First the government should create a clearer separation between itself and the stateowned PPC including a separate regulatory agency Second the government should consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to maximize competition as well as improving market access conditions for IPPs and cogenerators As the countrys largest employer PPC is not likely to effect these changes quickly White Thomas Read Ireland Supply competition was

India Five of Indias states have undertaken significant reforms Orissa Haryana Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh And only four of the State Electricity Boards SEBs the principal buyers for independent power are profitable IPP builders have been frustrated by a host of regulations lack of guarantees and SEB insolvencies The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted this year by the withdrawal of two major investors EdF and Cogentrix A draft Electricity Bill will be introduced in Parliament this winter It would create and empower autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions SEBs would be unbundled into GTD and corporatized within four months of passage Initially states would initially retain GD assets they would later be privatized Transmission assets would be put under an independent authority and TPA would be allowed Significantly IPP licensing requirements would be clarified and reduced and largely eliminated for the growing segment of captive producers A key problem of theft as high as of TD losses in some areas would be addressed by strict metering and high penalties The likelihood however of the Bill being passed as proposed is

advisers have also recommended that Napocor renegotiate some of its takeorpay contracts with IPPs asking some IPPs to reduce power offtake on an interim basis Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these conditions a longer life span for their projects but developers are reluctant to accept because of their own financial commitments Singapore Since initial restructuring and corporatization in

rules allow competition for large consumers A thorough review in by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recommended that generation be privatized but with restrictions on generation crossownership transmission and market operation functions be separated and an ISO established and that most retail services be privatized The government has granted two public retail licenses meaning that the two IPPs can sell electricity directly to large users Retail licenses are expected to be issued to the three power generators This will allow full competition for large industrial and commercial customers but retail competition for smaller customers is unlikely to be in place before South Korea South Korea is proceeding with a major restructuring program following government approval in July for stateowned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco Each of the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea Stock Exchange up to foreign

million credit to Vietnam to extend grid electricity to about households scattered throughout the country A few IPPs are trying to win generation projects An Electricity Law due to be enacted in would establish a National Electricity Office for regulation This would replace the existing haphazard villagelevel regulatory system Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations many Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations At the same time ownership limits imposed by several governments limit further investments by companies who have already entered the market According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of Venezuela and Mexico It estimates that million Latin Americans are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to investments And for those who were already open a new development is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either as concessions to build or as full privatizations A big factor impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance on hydropower Serious regionwide droughts during the last few years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors Argentina The big news is in Argentina transmission sector This fall

Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the basis for its diversification into telecom via its subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra Partially in response to Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans which will open the distribution market and reduce node unregulated prices from MW to MW Until now transmission charges have been based on existing operating costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also intended to remove control of the grid operation from the generators The proposed changes likely account for Hydro Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for the sale of Transelec in September marked a serious recession and drought seriously affecting hydro generators which represent nearly of Chiles generation Under the existing system generators had no incentive to plan for longterm supply Chile hopes the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to generation and to introduce competition into distribution heretofore a monopoly Colombia Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks against transmission installations have forced the government to postpone the sale of any further power assets including Isagen the state generator ISA the transco as well as regional distributors A March attack for instance caused a blackout in provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or more The government claims to be reassessing the rules but the reality is that the assets would not receive any decent offer now For now million new shares of capital in ISA will be sold to the public at a discount to democratize the

being a regulatory issue of interest mcs Forwarded by Mark SchroederLONECT on David NRONDEVELOPMENT To Robbi ES Michelle nron Communications Anthony NRON COMMUNICATIONS cc Wayne GardnerEnron nron Communications Mark CT JaeMoo NRON Craig nron Communications Stephen D NRON Mike DahlkeENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Korea Regulatory Impediment to Bandwidth Trading Action Plan Our regulatory review team in Korea this week has identified a major regulatory impediment to bandwidth trading in Korea This describes the problem and outlines a draft strategy to deal with it with actions shown in blue Problem It appears that under the Telecommunications Business Law as interpreted by the Korea Communications Commission in a recent ruling against MCI a Specific Services Provider Type which we want to be cannot resell International Private Leased Circuits wholesale Only a Facilities Based provider Network Services Provider can do resale of International Leased Lines under the current law We do not want to be a Network Services Provider because an NSP can not exceed foreign ownership and has immense responsibilities Factual Background We want to be a specific services provider Type reseller with facilities such as servers and switches Under the law as interpreted in the recent ruling however SSPs can buy or lease international lines only from NSPs cannot sell International Private Leased Circuits to other SSPs to ValueAdded Service Providers VSPs or to ISPs can sell international capacity only to end users not to other wholesalers The recent ruling came about when MCI not a Network Service Provider leased international lines from an NSP in Korea and resold them to Goldman Sachs for traffic to Hong Kong Korea Telecom brought a case against MCI to the Korea Communications Council KCC for decision Kim and Chang our Enron energy lawyers in Korea handled the case they did not disclose to us that MCI was the client The KCC ruled for KT and against MCI Im not sure yet why Goldman Sachs was treated as a wholesaler and not an end user which should have been legal At this point however the situation is that if a foreign company tried to resell IPLCs wholesale any local NSP could bring a complaint to the KCC and would run the regulatory risk of being forced to cease The sources for this conclusion are Kim and Chang the Ministry of Info and Communications and the Korea Information Society Institute a telecom policy think tank for the Ministry Options Change the law A revision of the law is drafted but does not fix this and changes are closed for this year Amendments on the floor of Parliament are impossible in Korea For a change in law we would have to try in summer to get a change in early Change by Presidential Decree is also possible but is overkill Not feasible Get a new interpretation from the Korea Communications Council that says what we plan to do in Korea in bandwidth is OK We would ask Kim and Chang to present our proposed plans to the KCC before we enter the bandwidth trading BWT market We would describe it in a way that is sufficiently different from the MCI case Jae Moo made this suggestion Pro If we get a favorable ruling we are in business We do not have money at risk unless the regulatory road is clear Con an unfavorable ruling slams the door specifically on us Recommended Steps We should explore this option with Kim and Chang Robbi or Michelle if you agree please contact Kim and Chang to discuss this and authorize start of this work if they agree with this approach I will work with you to develop the scope of work and can operate with Kim and Chang during the work as necessary We will contact MCI to get more facts on their case including whether they were selling to a wholesaler who sold to Goldman or directly to Goldman We can say the Ministry mentioned their case We should probably not be thinking about joint action with MCI at this point as we want to say our case is different if we can I will explore facts with an MCI contact in Tokyo and Craig will do same in Singapore Redefine where a sale of IPLCs takes place to have it not be in Korea Would need legalcommercial creative analysis Possible but uncertain option Redefine the product so as not to be a resale If we buy capacity and chop it up into smaller pieces or alter it before we sell it maybe we are not reselling what we bought But we may still have a problem if the new product is sold to wholesalers Lets explore and above and similar ideas in a conference call Robbi can you set up a call on this with me Donald youMichelle Wayne Gardner Craig Clark Roger Estrada Xi Xi Partnerjv with a local firm already having the NSP status such as KT SK Telecom Dacom etc or become an NSP foreign ownership restirction Huge regulatory filing Not feasible Parallel Actions Take issue up with US Trade Representative telecom in DC Jonathan McHale Also work with local Amcham telecom committee and US Embassy We should do this in parallel with whatever option we choose I will work on this with Steve Burns in DC when we are farther along Work to promote understanding of the merits of BWT for Koreaelsewhere BWT was never contemplated in the laws and regulations All our contacts said BWT needed to be explained more widely in Korea to gain support It is new even to the telecom think tanks We need to do missionary work on this to develop public opinion We need to find a noted PhD economist who is a great communicator who can speak to the think tanks in Korea Singapore Japan etc and give interviews on the merits of BWT for efficiency promoting investment etc This will create the climate for regulators to change I have one possibility in mind but suggestions of names welcome I will propose this separately to Anthony later David

reflecting on what I understand to be Jans rating at yesterdays fun ctional PRC First I have no issue with the criticism of his behaviours a nd interpersonal skills I have sent him several notes of coachingadmonis hment when he copied me on emails that were too strongly worded While so me account should be taken of his being Bavarian I do not think that is an excuse or cover for what is clearly an area for improvement Having sai d that I would add the following This is his first rating with the company I think After the month s he has just turned in I think a rating of which is what I understand he got is going to be a bit demoralising In additon people rarely move up two notches between periods If he is rated a and fixes his behaviou rs there is no doubt he would be a at yearend if he continued to perfo rm substantively as he has If he is rated now and continues to behave as he has he can go down to a and suffer the financial penalties associ ated with that Jan has had a halfyear of results that most people hope for He fixed a number of erroneous license applications initiated by Donald Lassere and in so doing secured licenses for EBS Europe in Germany France Belgium T he Netherlands and Spain I think and I think all or most were from about midDecember onwards BIG WIN After much toing and froing Jan not Tax not Legal not ou tside counsel not Accounting came up with the business structure for trad ing bandwidth in the Far East The first deal done there before Jans app roach required contracts with multiple entities It may now seem obviou s but Jan came up with the idea that each of the national telcos trades i n its own name across borders securing licenses in the name of the same e ntity in each country so why not EBS Asia This was a huge breakthrough f or EBS Asia Jan helped secure the Pioneer Tax Status zero corporate tax for at leas t years maybe ten in Singapore thus helping to secure Singapore as our Asian location of choice as opposed to more expensive Hong Kong along w ith the big success noted in my item below Jan secured the necessary clarifications on the license fee assessed in Singapore to make Singapore our location and EBS Asia licensed in Singapo re our vehicle for Asian bandwidth trading There was initially a clear and justified concern that we would be charged on gross turnover This has now been reduced to of the fees associated with Singapore traffic p hysical not financial only The repeated exchanges between Jan Tax Way ne Gardner and Fred Cohagan did get snippy so I would not be surprised i f this elicited bad feedback My explanation not an excuse is that Jan a sked for final issuesquestions several times and after each clarificati on from Singapore regulator IDA he got a barrage of questions internally and had to go back to IDA Some of the questions were legitimate some s hould have been thought of earlier so Jans frustration was partly underst andable partly not Second I think Jan got all the clarification he coul d in a farely opaque regulatory regime at least on the license fee questio n remember IDA was not too sure what we were up to and what they were op ining on I think Jan and me recognised that regulation is not always a s transparent in Europe and Asia as in the US Conversely you had a trade r Fred who I think has not had a big trading responsibility before and he was seeking transparancy that simply was not going to happen Jan told him so again after a few tries perhaps too abruptly As a team player Jan made the effort to support the Asian effort long hard travel including going out to interview the EBS regulatory affairs candidates we ended up with two qualified candidates even if we have now chosen to go with yet anotherthird candidate His willingness to helpbe a team player seems completely overlooked in focussing on his other behavi ours Finally Jans biggest problem is also his biggest asset There is no doubt in my mind that he knows more about the telecomms industry technical ly as well as the substance of regulation than anyone else in the Company He does not suffer those who know less than him very easily This is wro ng and needs to be addressed but I am concerned that he is effectively be ing taken down two notches for his interpersonal skills It seems the mess age we are sending is that we are in effect valuing good interpersonal sk ills over results A commercial person who has a big year but acts out of line gee can we think of any would not get a rating below acceptable for being abrasive It seems to me too harsh to rate Jan below acceptable for being abrasive if we also consider his Bavarian background and as I have shared with Rick the fact that Jan got a heightened sense of urgen cy from Jim Fallon that I think made Jan think his Jans behaviour was ac ceptable if all that mattered was getting results yesterday as Fallon p ut it Enough said Thanks for considering my views mcs

relationship with EnCom as well as what I am doing to develop a plan for the way forward with our investment Background As you may be aware Enron made its investment in EnCom in October Bruce Wrobel is PresidentCEO Our current cumulative investment is now We own and have the right to put members on a board of nine There are two other strategic Japanese investors in the business Orix primarily known as a leasing firm and YTC primarily a parts supplier for Toyota Enron Japan EJ in particular values Orix as a strategic partner even beyond the context of EnCom a fact that was reconfirmed when Ken Lay met with their Chairman during his recent week in Tokyo At present the relationship between EnCom its vehicle for doing business in Japan is E Power and I will use the two terms interchangeably and EJ is a difficult one EnCom entered the Japanese market some months before EJ entered and EnCom was seen in the market as Enrons entry vehicle for Japan I infer that EnCom has benefited from this association with the Enron name and Enron apparently did not discourage it in the early days With the arrival of EJ in Tokyo early this year Enron is working to roll out our wholesalemerchant business model in Japan EnComE Power has and continues to receive coverage in the media much of it selfgenerated indicating that they intend to sign up customers In fact E Powers COO Mr Awono says that they will need to sign up retail customers to be able to have load to support the large power projects they are planning to do This unlikely formula suggests at least on his part a degree of naivete at best about how offtake from plants in deregulated markets can be and should be managed Finally EJ reports meeting with customers eg Sony who indicate that E Power holds itself out as also being a trader This has caused some confusion in the marketplace about which Enron entity is providing wholesalemerchant services There now also is a question as to what EnComs business model in Japan should be Conversations between Orix and EJ personnel in Tokyo suggest that Orix believed that Enron would be intimately involved in the daytoday management of EnCom we are not and Bruce has conceded that prior to EJs reporting relationship into London being established Enron involvement and direction was largely absent Moreover it appears that Orix also believed that EnCom would be engaged in the business of aggregation of power supplies for further resale in the Japanese market this is essentially describing the core Enron merchant business in different terms Conversations between Orix and EJ indicate that Orix now does not see EnCom having in place the people and skills to execute on an aggregation business strategy Rather Orix sees EnCom as having the skill sets of largescale asset developers and this is not a business Orix is particularly interested in pursuing Finally Orix has an employee secunded to EnComE Power and he reports that Orix now even lacks confidence in EnComs ability to deliver any largescale asset development opportunities John and I are tentatively scheduled to meet Orixs Chairman in London on th November To give E Power its due it is now also frustrated Wrobel telephone conversation with me because Ken Lay clearly signaled in some of his media interviews in Tokyo that we were bringing the full panoply of Enron skills to the market including the possibility of largescale power projects It is Wrobels view that this message in the marketplace now undercuts EnCom as he believes that people will look to a billion market cap company as a preferred counterparty for asset development over a company capitalised at present to the tune of about million There is also a Business Opportunities Agreement between EnCom and EJ addressing how opportunities that come to Enron personnel who are also on EnComs Board should be handled Wrobel believes that we are being a bit narrow in our interpretation of the Business Opportunities Agreement a view I do not share Kens statements are correct ie we can do largescale developments in JapanIn sum there is not an agreement as to a clear division of lines of business between the two organisations At present frustrations on both sides about confusion in the marketplace and in media messages EnCom has now agreed that Enron will lead all contacts with the media for both firms have contributed to a situation that is not amicable Communications in Tokyo between EJ and E Power have virtually dried up though recently EJ has invited E Power to work together on a Proposal for Mitsubishi So Where Are We John has asked me to lead an effort to evaluate Enrons investment in EnCom This will be fairly comprehensive including an assessment of the talent on the ground in Tokyo an assessment of the viability of their prospects both in terms of likelihood of permitting and to the extent possible their economics and an assessment of what Enrons stake in this venture ought to be going forward I will evaluate the full range from assuming control to a reduced stake even down to zero to taking equity in particular projects As such I have sent to Wrobel a list of items reflecting our initial information requirements for due diligence Second while this due diligence proceeds we are also attempting to agree on respective roles for EnCom and EJ in the Japanese market We remain committed to retaining an asset development capability in the market which does not go down well with Wrobel We also are sceptical that EnCom has on board now or will acquire the risk management skills that we believe will be necessary to actually manage fuel and offtake along the lines that Enron has found highly profitable eg Sutton Bridge tolling We have said that we respect their talent for being able to develop largescale assets though our Technical Services Group has already questioned their high staffing levels and that we feel the profitmaximising strategy for both firms is for EnCom to develop projects sites permits engineering with Enron holding a tolling agreement and doing the project financing We believe E Power should be able to develop very bankable deals on this basis We do not have agreement on this point Wrobel seemingly believes that they will be able to do the risk management functions and receive lucrative returns for the assets they do develop At this early stage we see no evidence that they can manage such risks or that lenders would let them do that and that it is more likely that they will end up with a classic IPP structure with gas in PPA out and reasonable but not rich returns on equity Wrobel sees our tolling agreement proposition as taking too much out of EnComs deals For our part we have said we are willing to assure attractive equity returns without saying what that number is and reward them for their development efforts Our latest effort is to try to agree a tolling arrangement for a project in Tohoku province E Power has already met local officials As it turns out EJ was approached by national government to do a project at the same industrial complex as that which E Power is working on By letter from me to Wrobel of November Enron has proposed that we pool or combine our efforts ie E Powers engineering and local permitting expertise with Enrons political capital garnered at national level get the project done together rather than competing and divide our labours as noted above ie Enron does fuel and offtake E Power does development of the asset In the phone call from me to Wrobel that preceded the sending of the letter Wrobel expressed serious displeasure with Enrons proposal He and I are to speak again he is to call me back and if he does not do so on November I will call him on November I will plan to make progress on my wider review assuming cooperation from EnCom on our due diligence information requirements John and I are committed to moving this forward quickly but much of the necessary information is not in hand Please let me know if you have any further questions

forward to hearing from you With best wishes Stephen Original Message From To Sent Friday September AM Subject Re retail competition in electricity Enron is interested in supporting your work but I need to discuss it further with you I am travelling the next working days I could reach you from my travel but if you receive this today Friday please call me in London at I look forward to hearing from you thank you Mark Schroeder Embedded Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp image moved to file From Stephen Littlechild picpcx To Ralph Hodge cc Mark Schroeder Kyran Hanks Subject retail competition in electricity Dear Ralph I have just written a paper on retail competition in electricity arguing that Joskow Hogan and Ruff and California have got it all wrong both in theory and in practice It is forthcoming shortly in the DAE and Judge Institute working paper series at Cambridge but I thought you might like to see a copy now attached This is obviously a hot issue in California at present and this morning I received an invitation to participate in a debate there in November copy forwarded separately It seems that Enron is also to be invited I have no other commitments in the US at that time Is is something that Enron might be interested in supporting or for that matter developing further We spoke some time ago about the Common Carriage Consultative Working Group at Ofwat I did in fact aprticipate in that along with Kyran Hanks It was a real eyeopener to see how little awareness there was of the basic conditions conducive to competition like separate businesses and accounts Im not sure whether Enron is pursuing this now or not No doubt lots of other things going on I should be interested to hear from you on retail competition I am copying this to Mark Schroeder and Kyran With regards Stephen See attached file Summary Augdoc See attached file Why we need electricity retailers Augdoc
