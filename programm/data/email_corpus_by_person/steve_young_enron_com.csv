Confidential Eric I spoke earlier today with the banker who led the TECOPanda financing for Societe Generale lead arranger with Citi on the bill merchant project financing Following is a summary of

however this should cover many of your questions Call upon return after the holiday and we can discuss further Also attached after notes is an article that should capture many of the financing details

and MM in funded equity Apparently all of the MM equity was funded at close June further confirmation is needed Of the Bill in debt Bill was nonrecourse and MM was an equity bridge with recourse to

<22876149.1075858301988.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,steve.young@enron.com,2000-02-01 02:27:00,Re Cc Thanks for the note to David It had the desired impact as David walked around first thing and was very appreciative As I said before this is the right message in this situation based on the actions taken by David which now tend to get a bit lost in the current noise ie exposure having now increased to MM Relative to the MtoM David had questioned both Beasley and Sweeney Comm Suppt about the MtoM starting well before the September prepay of to Vnesh Beasley said the prudency would cover the exposure while Sweeney simply evaded the questions and was not forthcoming Sweeneys responses were most curious as I understand hes among the strongest in Commercial Support and my experience with him to date is consistent with this view We learned in the last couple of days that emails were circulating within Liquids commercial support and commercial back to early summer concerning the situation and need to hold the prudency first booked in July Hardy did not press for copies of these emails yesterday since at this point it would not be terribly productive but I find it very troubling that this kind of communication was taking place so early in the process and all involved were not informed beyond those close to Beasley The key issue here is that David was asking for the information at the right time but was kept out of the loop not that his exposure reports did not include the MtoM starting in Nov when we learned of the magnitude of the problem In hindsight we should not have allowed the Sept prepay to Vnesh until we had received a satisfactory response However given the fact that David was asking the right people it is unreasonable for anyone to be critical of his actions in the least Thoughts or questions SY Rick Buy To David CT cc bcc Steve W YoungLONECT Subject David Would rather have done this by phone but there is no chance for the next couple of days so I thought I would send you an email Steve tells me that the message from Helsinki investigation has been misinterpreted by you and you are feeling like you have been unjustly blamed for at least part of the problem here This is not how this situation is being thought of here as a matter of fact we in RAC are quite pleased with the level of coverage on this deal from the outset and I believe it was RAC that started sounding warning bells long before any other group did Your coverage of this deal has been of the highest level All of us should have picked up on the MTM vs cash issue but the DASH clearly stated that the pre pay was the determining control here which was monitored carefully and nicely plotted historically We could not produce that result in any other area where we do business In any event your performance is not being called into question here in the least and you should take pride in the fact that we were on top of this deal from the outset Having said all that I believe there are some valuable lessons that RAC needs to learn here and I think we need a meeting to discuss these I think one of the biggest problems here was that strong detective measures AA audit RAC issues etc were pointed out to commercial people and basically ignored This is what we have to focus on More about this later In the mean time continue to focus on this It is a good lesson for the rest of the group to amplify how important what we do is Keep up good work and have a beer Cheers Rick

<11399938.1075858302038.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,steve.young@enron.com,2000-01-25 09:07:00,Helsinki Update on Various Issuesdefer to you two on what of the following needs to be communicated on to others in Houston Ilkka Nigel Sellens EEL HR phoned to confirm Ilkka had been terminated this morning He faxed the letter given to Ilkka and effectively tied termination to gross misconduct As expected Ilkka disputes this Nigel left resignation on the table with Ilkka as an option which would involve tearing up the letter I mentioned to Nigel that I dont believe resignation should be an option given the circumstances I asked Nigel to get back with me on this if Ilkka wants to discuss this further Moving Operations to London This morning I checked with Nigel Kevin Sweeney Acctg and Graham Cane Logistics to assure that they are preparing for the possibility that all operations are moved to London I went ahead and made the calls to assure that all were prepared so that we dont lose days if it is agreed later this week that this is the best course of action As one alternative Olga K in CRM may need to be involved with rail movements due to the need to have a Russian speaker for communicating with Russian border authorities for rail deliveries if no one in Helsinki will move to London for the near term Youll note from prior emails that business is still being conducted from Helsinki so further communication on this point is clearly necessary since this is in conflict with the wishes of those in last nights conference call Status of Audit I spoke with Graham Cane London Logistics who is in Helsinki going over documentation with AA He now believes BLs have been adjusted Typically there is one stamped Original BL and numerous stamped NonNegotiable copies of the BL It appears that in some instances vessel stamps and the master signature have been cut off of originals and glued on to altered copies which dont have these stamps Further confirmation comes from the fact that BLs attached to invoices sent back from customers representing agreed settlement of a delivery dont match the originals Going Forward Ive not seen AAs scope but would expect it is comprehensive given the magnitude of the circumstances and history I would recommend that one of you have input just to assure that it is exhaustive and representative of issues of concern to RAC as well I would assume the timelineaction items if it exists beyond AAs work would look something like the following To my knowledge there is not yet an aggregated list of action items beyond work by AA Thoughts or questions Action Timing Finalize the review of all Vnesh documents Complete late this week Agree no new business and explicitly define bsns impacted Immediate as this does not appear to be discussed or agreed note Establish approach to recovery alternatives from Vnesh note Starting Next week Review other counterparty documentation for contingent liabilities note J Nowlan and I agreed back in Nov that prepays were finished for now However no new business at all out of Helsinki was not discussed since the issue of altered documentation had not come to light note Apparently Vnesh delivered and documented product as fixed price delivered product at some point on all fixed price contracts even the two they are now disputing as floating Therefore by implication they have acknowledged the fixed nature through these deliveries This and other issues do suggest we may have a case for some measurable recovery once we know the severity of the document tampering issue
