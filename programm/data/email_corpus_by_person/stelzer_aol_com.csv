<3861570.1075840228154.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,stelzer@aol.com,2000-12-06 03:15:00,Stelzer col Cc Attention John Jay IRWIN M STELZER The Sunday Times December Buried deep in an issue of last weeks Wall Street Journal is an interview with venture capitalist Bill Davidow As the crash in the value of internet companies sours investors and fills the financial pages with tales of impending doom Mr Davidow has taken to reminding all who will listen There was a tulip business even after the tulip mania Which prompted me to dig out my copy of Mike Dashs Tulipomania subtitled The Story of the Worlds Most Coveted Flower The Extraordinary Passions It Aroused Davidow is indeed right and in the postbubble history of the tulip business may lurk some clues as to the history of the dotcoms many of which have been liquidated while others have seen their values fall by as much as After the bubble burst the trade in bulbs did not disappear Prices fell but in a few years the trade regained some sort of equilibrium The speculators had gone but there was still a market for the flower But at far lower prices with the specialty bulbs doing better than the garden variety tulip And it is not to stretch the analogy between tulipgrowing and the dotcom business to cite Dashs observation that most of the new and inexperienced growers who had been attracted by the prospect of rich profits gave up the business or were driven out Eventually bulb growers learned how to turn a profit again They converted their business from a seasonal one to one that could produce all year round something etailers have still to learn They learned how to destroy the viruses that periodically destroyed their businesses something Microsoft et al have still to learn They learned how to compete with other varieties of flower just as etailers have been learning how to click with bricksandmortar retailers In short although the past is not necessarily prologue history suggests that there indeed life after a bubble bursts For one thing investors have short memories the tulipomania was followed by a spurt in the prices of hyacinths in the eighteenth century and by one in dahlias in Indeed as recently as prices of the red spider lily soared in China reaching for the most coveted varieties an amount that puts even the sums paid at the height of the Dutch tulip craze to shame according to Dash More important the bursting of a bubble separates the wheat from the chaff The fact that the business graveyard is overflowing with the corpses of dotcoms tells us less about the future role of the internet in our economic lives than it does about the propensity of some to irrational exuberance It should come as no surprise that companies that not only failed to earn any money as their customer lists swelled but touted their mounting losses as proof of their success in growing their businesses should eventually fall from investor favour Nor should it be surprising that inexperienced entrepreneurs whose sole lasting contribution to American life has been the destruction of the business suit have discovered that there is more to running a successful business than attracting the adulation of equally young and casually clad reporters for trade magazines Finally it should not surprise us that the accumulation of data in this era of the socalled new economy has led to a more sober appraisal of the contribution of new technologies to the ability of the American economy to grow without triggering significant inflation We now know that the massive investment in new technologies has increased the rate of growth in productivity and that the economys speed limit has been raised to something closer to than to its old limit of about half that Thats not as revolutionary as some of the more strident new economy advocates have been claiming but it is enough to make an unemployment rate of only sustainable in the long run without setting off a round of wageprice inflation What we have then is what might be called the residue of the dotcom collapse a new way of doing business greater productivity in important sectors of the economy lower transactions costs as buyers and sellers come together
