<17257505.1075851660833.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ek@a-klaw.com,2001-10-22 14:16:58,RE Angelides Oct th Letter to L Lynch Urging July DA Suspension DateNonPrivilegedpst Thank you for your explanation Often I think too literally and narrowly and forget about the importance of spin All the same I think we should know if Loretta appreciates the open support of evil industry or notId say its worth a call E Original Message From Dasovich Jeff mailtoJeff NRONcom Sent Monday October PM To Evelyn Kahl Subject RE Angelides Oct th Letter to L Lynch Urging July DA Suspension Date Great question If you think it would be useful I can back channel to Loretta and find out Im of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides so that his wild assertions dont go unanswered in the court of public opinion Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides instead On the other hand I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools processes etc necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand and ensure that theres not the sort of massive costshifting to which Angelides refers on the other In the publics view this has been painted as an eitheror issue Either we end direct access or granny faces death and destruction And thats just not the case In fact I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isnt in the cards period But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views Let me know if youd like me to find out if Loretta thinks the letter would help her Could find that out in pretty short order Best Jeff Original Message From Evelyn Kahl mailto Sent Monday October PM To Dasovich Jeff Subject RE Angelides Oct th Letter to L Lynch Urging July DA Suspension Date Has anyone ever stopped to ask Loretta whether the letters are helpful or not Two things occur to me First it is not becoming for a commissioner to be taking actions consistent with the urgings of industry particularly if youre a Democrat Second it has always struck me that what she needs is some form of record support not political pats on the back in onepage letters I am asking you these questions not judging the proposal to send a letter but Ive never understood what theyre supposed to do for her and I honestly would like to understand E Original Message From Dasovich Jeff mailtoJeff NRONcom Sent Monday October AM To Dasovich Jeff Subject RE Angelides Oct th Letter to L Lynch Urging July DA Suspension Date FYI Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authoritys own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short despite DWR contracts and DA stampede which should leave one to believe that contrary to Angelides letter the more the DA the better Which further supports Loretta Lynchs response to the Angelides letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy Best Jeff CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority Power Authority was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October agenda the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November meeting acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources DWR rate agreement stalemate has been resolved Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commissions rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts to contract for peaker generation andor to implement demand side programs The Power Authority relies upon DWRs credit to fund these programs and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from biomass facilities in the Central Valley as well as MW generated by wind With the Current Glut of Contracts Why Do We Need Additional Reserves Kellan Flukinger Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in longterm contracts there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State He believes that the shortterm contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to pricespikes and supply shortages He believes that the reserve can be managed through TimeofUse and RealTimePricing conservation
