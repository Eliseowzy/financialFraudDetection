extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced

worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state 
<32284190.1075847622860.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,sherri.sera@enron.com,2001-03-08 15:33:00, Important Lessonsme a softie but I couldnt help passing this one on Have a great weekend SRS First Important Lesson Everyones job is important During my second month of nursing school our professor gave us a pop quiz I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions until I read the last one What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school Surely this was some kind of joke I had seen the cleaning woman several times She was tall darkhaired and in her s but how would I know her name I left the question blank Just before class ended one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade Absolutely said the professor In your careers you will meet many people All are significant They deserve your attention and care even if all you do is smile and say hello Ive never forgotten that lesson I also learned her name was Dorothy Second Important Lesson Pickup in the Rain One night at PM an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride Soaking wet she decided to flag down the next car A young white man stopped to help her generally unheard of in those conflictfilled s The man took her to safety helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi cab She seemed to be in a big hurry but wrote down his address and thanked him Seven days went by and a knock came on the mans door To his surprise a giant onsole color TV was delivered to his home A special note was attached It read Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night The rain drenched not only my clothes but also my spirits Then you came along Because of you I was able to make it to my dying husbands bedside just before he passed away God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others Sincerely Mrs Nat King Cole Third Important Lesson Always remember those who serve In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less a year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table A waitress put a glass of water in front of him How much is an ice cream sundae he asked Fifty cents replied the waitress The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it Well how much is a plain dish of ice cream he inquired By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient Thirtyfive cents she brusquely replied The little boy again counted his coins Ill have the plain ice cream he said The waitress brought the ice cream put the bill on the table and walked away The boy finished the ice cream paid the cashier and left When the waitress came back she began to cry as she wiped down the table There placed neatly beside the empty dish were two nickels and five pennies You see he couldnt have the sundae because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip Fourth Important Lesson The Obstacle in Our Path In ancient times a King had a boulder placed on a roadway Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock Some of the kings wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables Upon approaching the boulder the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road After much pushing and straining he finally succeeded After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been The purse contained many gold coins ad a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway The peasant learned what many of us never understand Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition Fifth Important Lesson Giving When it Counts Many years ago when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her year old brother who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness The doctor explained the situation to her little brother and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying Yes Ill do it if it will save her As the transfusion progressed he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled as we all did seeing the color returning to her cheeks Then his face grew pale and his smile faded He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice Will I start to die right away Being young the little boy had misunderstood the doctor he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her You see after all understanding and attitude are everything

Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

<8522284.1075847770946.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,sherri.sera@enron.com,2001-03-08 15:33:00, Important Lessonsme a softie but I couldnt help passing this one on Have a great weekend SRS First Important Lesson Everyones job is important During my second month of nursing school our professor gave us a pop quiz I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions until I read the last one What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school Surely this was some kind of joke I had seen the cleaning woman several times She was tall darkhaired and in her s but how would I know her name I left the question blank Just before class ended one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade Absolutely said the professor In your careers you will meet many people All are significant They deserve your attention and care even if all you do is smile and say hello Ive never forgotten that lesson I also learned her name was Dorothy Second Important Lesson Pickup in the Rain One night at PM an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride Soaking wet she decided to flag down the next car A young white man stopped to help her generally unheard of in those conflictfilled s The man took her to safety helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi cab She seemed to be in a big hurry but wrote down his address and thanked him Seven days went by and a knock came on the mans door To his surprise a giant onsole color TV was delivered to his home A special note was attached It read Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night The rain drenched not only my clothes but also my spirits Then you came along Because of you I was able to make it to my dying husbands bedside just before he passed away God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others Sincerely Mrs Nat King Cole Third Important Lesson Always remember those who serve In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less a year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table A waitress put a glass of water in front of him How much is an ice cream sundae he asked Fifty cents replied the waitress The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it Well how much is a plain dish of ice cream he inquired By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient Thirtyfive cents she brusquely replied The little boy again counted his coins Ill have the plain ice cream he said The waitress brought the ice cream put the bill on the table and walked away The boy finished the ice cream paid the cashier and left When the waitress came back she began to cry as she wiped down the table There placed neatly beside the empty dish were two nickels and five pennies You see he couldnt have the sundae because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip Fourth Important Lesson The Obstacle in Our Path In ancient times a King had a boulder placed on a roadway Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock Some of the kings wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables Upon approaching the boulder the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road After much pushing and straining he finally succeeded After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been The purse contained many gold coins ad a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway The peasant learned what many of us never understand Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition Fifth Important Lesson Giving When it Counts Many years ago when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her year old brother who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness The doctor explained the situation to her little brother and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying Yes Ill do it if it will save her As the transfusion progressed he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled as we all did seeing the color returning to her cheeks Then his face grew pale and his smile faded He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice Will I start to die right away Being young the little boy had misunderstood the doctor he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her You see after all understanding and attitude are everything

needed a ride Soaking wet she decided to flag down the next car A young white man stopped to help her generally unheard of in those conflictfilled s The man took her to safety helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi cab She seemed to be in a big hurry but wrote down his address and thanked him Seven days went by and a knock came on the mans door To his surprise a giant onsole color TV was delivered to his home A special note was attached It read Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night The rain drenched not only my clothes but also my spirits Then you came along Because of you I was able to make it to my dying husbands bedside just before he passed away God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others Sincerely Mrs Nat King Cole Third Important Lesson Always remember those who serve In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less a year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table A waitress put a glass of water in front of him How much is an ice cream sundae he asked Fifty cents replied the waitress The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it Well how much is a plain dish of ice cream he inquired By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient Thirtyfive cents she brusquely replied The little boy again counted his coins Ill have the plain ice cream he said The waitress brought the ice cream put the bill on the table and walked away The boy finished the ice cream paid the cashier and left When the waitress came back she began to cry as she wiped down the table There placed neatly beside the empty dish were two nickels and five pennies You see he couldnt have the sundae because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip Fourth Important Lesson The Obstacle in Our Path In ancient times a King had a boulder placed on a roadway Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock Some of the kings wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables Upon approaching the boulder the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road After much pushing and straining he finally succeeded After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been The purse contained many gold coins ad a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway The peasant learned what many of us never understand Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition Fifth Important Lesson Giving When it Counts Many years ago when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her year old brother who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness The doctor explained the situation to her little brother and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying Yes Ill do it if it will save her As the transfusion progressed he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled as we all did seeing the color returning to her cheeks Then his face grew pale and his smile faded He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice Will I start to die right away Being young the little boy had misunderstood the doctor he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her You see after all understanding and attitude are everything

NRON cc Subject Re California Energy Crisis Mr Lay and Mr Skilling I shared the below article with my brother due to his interest in the California energy crisis Since he is an outside source I thought you might like to see his comments regarding your article They follow below I read the entire article you sent on the California power crisis by Enron I think they should publish this very article in all of the California papers Thats the simplest and best get to the point no bull article Ive seen on the matter I would agree with their assesment of the mess Californians have no one to blame but their State government s stupidity although theyre trying to find someone Thanks for an understandable article Lana Steffen Administrative Analyst Liberal KS Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling PM Sent by Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject California Energy Crisis Californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

Lesson Everyones job is important During my second month of nursing school our professor gave us a pop quiz I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions until I read the last one What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school Surely this was some kind of joke I had seen the cleaning woman several times She was tall darkhaired and in her s but how would I know her name I left the question blank Just before class ended one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade Absolutely said the professor In your careers you will meet many people All are significant They deserve your attention and care even if all you do is smile and say hello Ive never forgotten that lesson I also learned her name was Dorothy Second Important Lesson Pickup in the Rain One night at PM an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride Soaking wet she decided to flag down the next car A young white man stopped to help her generally unheard of in those conflictfilled s The man took her to safety helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi cab She seemed to be in a big hurry but wrote down his address and thanked him Seven days went by and a knock came on the mans door To his surprise a giant onsole color TV was delivered to his home A special note was attached It read Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night The rain drenched not only my clothes but also my spirits Then you came along Because of you I was able to make it to my dying husbands bedside just before he passed away God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others Sincerely Mrs Nat King Cole Third Important Lesson Always remember those who serve In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less a year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table A waitress put a glass of water in front of him How much is an ice cream sundae he asked Fifty cents replied the waitress The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it Well how much is a plain dish of ice cream he inquired By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient Thirtyfive cents she brusquely replied The little boy again counted his coins Ill have the plain ice cream he said The waitress brought the ice cream put the bill on the table and walked away The boy finished the ice cream paid the cashier and left When the waitress came back she began to cry as she wiped down the table There placed neatly beside the empty dish were two nickels and five pennies You see he couldnt have the sundae because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip Fourth Important Lesson The Obstacle in Our Path In ancient times a King had a boulder placed on a roadway Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock Some of the kings wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables Upon approaching the boulder the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road After much pushing and straining he finally succeeded After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been The purse contained many gold coins ad a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway The peasant learned what many of us never understand Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition Fifth Important Lesson Giving When it Counts Many years ago when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her year old brother who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness The doctor explained the situation to her little brother and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying Yes Ill do it if it will save her As the transfusion progressed he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled as we all did seeing the color returning to her cheeks Then his face grew pale and his smile faded He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice Will I start to die right away Being young the little boy had misunderstood the doctor he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her You see after all understanding and attitude are everything

cc Subject Re California Energy Crisis Mr Lay and Mr Skilling I shared the below article with my brother due to his interest in the California energy crisis Since he is an outside source I thought you might like to see his comments regarding your article They follow below I read the entire article you sent on the California power crisis by Enron I think they should publish this very article in all of the California papers Thats the simplest and best get to the point no bull article Ive seen on the matter I would agree with their assesment of the mess Californians have no one to blame but their State government s stupidity although theyre trying to find someone Thanks for an understandable article Lana Steffen Administrative Analyst Liberal KS Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling PM Sent by Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject California Energy Crisis Californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

<202867.1075848220656.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,sherri.sera@enron.com,2001-03-08 15:33:00, Important Lessonsme a softie but I couldnt help passing this one on Have a great weekend SRS First Important Lesson Everyones job is important During my second month of nursing school our professor gave us a pop quiz I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions until I read the last one What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school Surely this was some kind of joke I had seen the cleaning woman several times She was tall darkhaired and in her s but how would I know her name I left the question blank Just before class ended one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade Absolutely said the professor In your careers you will meet many people All are significant They deserve your attention and care even if all you do is smile and say hello Ive never forgotten that lesson I also learned her name was Dorothy Second Important Lesson Pickup in the Rain One night at PM an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride Soaking wet she decided to flag down the next car A young white man stopped to help her generally unheard of in those conflictfilled s The man took her to safety helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi cab She seemed to be in a big hurry but wrote down his address and thanked him Seven days went by and a knock came on the mans door To his surprise a giant onsole color TV was delivered to his home A special note was attached It read Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night The rain drenched not only my clothes but also my spirits Then you came along Because of you I was able to make it to my dying husbands bedside just before he passed away God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others Sincerely Mrs Nat King Cole Third Important Lesson Always remember those who serve In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less a year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table A waitress put a glass of water in front of him How much is an ice cream sundae he asked Fifty cents replied the waitress The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it Well how much is a plain dish of ice cream he inquired By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient Thirtyfive cents she brusquely replied The little boy again counted his coins Ill have the plain ice cream he said The waitress brought the ice cream put the bill on the table and walked away The boy finished the ice cream paid the cashier and left When the waitress came back she began to cry as she wiped down the table There placed neatly beside the empty dish were two nickels and five pennies You see he couldnt have the sundae because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip Fourth Important Lesson The Obstacle in Our Path In ancient times a King had a boulder placed on a roadway Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock Some of the kings wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables Upon approaching the boulder the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road After much pushing and straining he finally succeeded After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been The purse contained many gold coins ad a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway The peasant learned what many of us never understand Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition Fifth Important Lesson Giving When it Counts Many years ago when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her year old brother who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness The doctor explained the situation to her little brother and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying Yes Ill do it if it will save her As the transfusion progressed he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled as we all did seeing the color returning to her cheeks Then his face grew pale and his smile faded He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice Will I start to die right away Being young the little boy had misunderstood the doctor he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her You see after all understanding and attitude are everything

NRON cc Subject Re California Energy Crisis Mr Lay and Mr Skilling I shared the below article with my brother due to his interest in the California energy crisis Since he is an outside source I thought you might like to see his comments regarding your article They follow below I read the entire article you sent on the California power crisis by Enron I think they should publish this very article in all of the California papers Thats the simplest and best get to the point no bull article Ive seen on the matter I would agree with their assesment of the mess Californians have no one to blame but their State government s stupidity although theyre trying to find someone Thanks for an understandable article Lana Steffen Administrative Analyst Liberal KS Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling PM Sent by Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject California Energy Crisis Californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state
