sure Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday January PM To Kari Dohn Subject RE Additional Materials Its hard to disagree with the fact that the utilities are the ones that cut the deal theyre living with and they took all of the stranded cost money that consumers paid them and invested it in other states and countries But you can only buy for cents and sell for cents for so long before creditors turn off the spigot Difficult to see how the spigot stays on with the draft decision issued today See story attached below With bankruptcy the only one making any decisions is the judge and while some see benefits to that seems to us that from a political financial and commercial perspective bankruptcy creates many more problems than it solves That said were extremely sensitive to the politics of rate increases But if the increases are subject to refund then decision makers can buy themselves some time by erring just slightly to the high side of a rate increase which could fend off the ratings agencies and provide additional opportunity over the next days or so to scrutinize the utilities claims and come up with comprehensive solutions to the bigger problems Well you got my two cents Sorry about that Best Jeff Late afternoon news USA Calif utility ratings may fall too far on pct hike By Jonathan Stempel Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW YORK Jan Reuters Bankruptcy may loom and the credit ratings of the two largest California electric utilities will likely fall too far if that states Public Utilities Commission awards them an interim rate hike of to percent analysts said Wednesday In a draft decision on Wednesday the CPUC proposed an immediate hike of percent for residential customers of Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison and hikes of seven to percent for various business customers The CPUC commission is expected to issue a final decision on Thursday It forces the utilities and their creditors to be limbo dancers and skilled limbo dancers at that said Shawn Burke head of US investmentgrade research at Barclays Capital PGE and SCE had requested respective rate increases of percent and percent a hike that would help them avoid imminent bankruptcy The utilities have also asked the regulators to remove a freeze on retail rates imposed under Californias law that deregulated the states electricity market On a day when most stocks roared ahead after the Federal Reserve announced surprise interest rate cuts investors beat down the stocks of Pacific GEs parent San Franciscobased PGE Corp and SoCal Edisons parent Edison International PGE shares closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at down or percent while Edison International shares closed at down or percent on the Big Board Bond quotations were not immediately available for the utilities bonds which in recent weeks have traded like junk Pacific GE and SoCal Edison were banking on a big rate hike to allow them to pass on some of their soaring wholesale power costs to consumers The utilities which operate under a rate freeze have accumulated more than billion in unrecovered costs since wholesale power prices started skyrocketing last summer amid a worsening electricity shortage in the state They claim they are running out of money due to the price freeze and have billions of dollars of bills coming due in the next six weeks Central to their concerns is whether credit rating agencies Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors will cut their medium investment grades to junk status No one knows for sure but if we consider the average rate hike is only about percent it will be difficult for the companies to maintain investmentgrade ratings said Dorothea Matthews a fixedincome electric utilities analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex Brown The utilities have already been unable to tap shortterm capital markets because of their precarious financial state Downgrades to junk which the agencies have already threatened would cement the door shut to these markets and cause the utilities to default on some of their loans Late Wednesday PGE Chief Executive Gordon Smith said the commissions proposed hikes could jeopardize his utilitys future loans Even a downgrade to the lowest investment grades Baa for longterm debt and Prime for shortterm debt from Moodys and BBBminus and A from SP would make the going very difficult for the utilities The reason shortterm debt markets are often closed to companies with those ratings Unless this process allows the rating agencies to keep AP ratings on the shortterm debt of both companies then this process has largely been a waste of everyones time said Burke Still he said there is a reasonable chance despite todays weak recommendation that the situation can be salvaged with midtripleB ratings which would allow a lifeline to conventional sources of liquidity Moodys and SP were not available for comment Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Kari Dohn Kari O To VCAGOV cc Subject

concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market January Vol No Price Policy and Misperception The ringing in of marks the completion of the fourth year since Pennsylvanias electricity

performance and assistance for lowincome customers are crucial factors the price of power has alone become the main standard for judging the success or failure of competitive transition policies Near hysteria about prices is yet another fallout of the California mess where rates are a daily nightmare for consumers In an effort to broaden electricity policy discussion beyond the myopic focus on California we note that competitive residential retail prices of electricity in Pennsylvania this New Year are considerably below what customers were paying for generation and transmission service or embedded generation on January If you doubt it compare columns B and D below Just as interestingly competitive prices for renewable energy products are well less than what customers of Duquesne Light

fact were it not for stranded cost charges Pennsylvanias residential customers would have had their total rates including distribution and transition rates decline by about in Generation rates would have declined by as much as These huge price reductions are real but will not fully reach customers during the transition period when utilities are allowed to collect stranded costs Competitive retail prices are also in most cases less than Pennsylvanias default rates or shopping credits This is important and encouraging because Pennsylvanias current residential default rates or shopping credits are in every case much less than what customers were paying for generation service at the start of the competitive transition Indeed current default rates are about one to three cents per kilowatthour less than residential customers were paying for the same service from their local utility prior to competition The California fiasco has meant a lot of discussion about the price of electricity but it has not meant a lot of understanding of sensible competitive policies potential impact on retail prices Instead a great deal of reporting reflects understandable misconception of basic price benchmarks For example very few stories identify accurately or even at all what customers were paying for generation service prior to competition the precompetition embedded generation rate of the incumbent utility This failing can be traced to the fact that states have not prominently made this data available Worse yet many press articles mistakenly assume the default rate or the shopping credit is equal to what customers were paying the local utility for generation service prior to competition and report that competition will lead to price shock for customers if market prices exceed present default rates But this dramatic warning is typically wrong The press misunderstanding hides an important fact current default rates or shopping credits are nearly always much less than what customers were paying for generation service prior to competition Total rates after the transition to competition will not be greater than they were prior to competition unless competitive retail rates exceed the utilitys precompetition embedded generation rate Consequently if competitive prices are higher than current default rates but lower than a utilitys precompetition embedded generation rate consumers will have lower total rates once stranded cost charges are removed and the transition period expires That is they will if a state creates a genuinely competitive retail market that

is no question the ISO has been paying prices that exceed even the already high market prices On Tuesday for example the ISO paid an average price of MWh for power that other western utilities had bought and sold for MWh On that one day the ISO paid almost million for power that was worth about million The reason The ISO has had to pay a premium to the rest of the market since the middle of December when suppliers correctly figured out that the utilities were running out of cash and wouldnt be able to pay their ISO bills Once northwestern utilities stopped selling to the ISO at any price the ISO asked some of the instate generating companies like Williams Cos WMB to step into the middle on its behalf Williams did so for what it has called a reasonable profit Lets say that Williams bought from some other generator at MWh and sold to the ISO at MWh That would be reasonable based on Williams costs according to the ISOs view But if the generator sold directly to the ISO in the first place at MWhit would be ordered to provide a refund because its generating costs are assuredly nowhere near MWh So according to the ISO MWh is reasonable but MWh is too high If the FERC were to order refunds as the ISO has requested no company that generates power would ever again sell to the ISO It would always sell to some third party which in turn would sell the electricity to the ISO at a markup Does the ISO ever stop and think through the impact of what it tries to do We certainly recognize thats a problem and its something FERC needs to grapple with Hildebrandt said in an interview What the FERC will do is save the ISO from itself We reject proposals to return to costbased regulation the FERC said in its Dec California ruling The FERC will review some of the high prices as

ruling But collusion wont likely be found There have been many investigations into whether sellers have created a false scarcity None have found it In December Republican FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert

to pay a creditrisk premium arose after the FERC had decided what it would do about California But according to a source knowledgeable about FERC operations under Heberts leadership the commission will recognize the creditrisk premium as reasonable In the meantime however the specter of retroactive price controls and the increased hassle of dealing with the ISO makes suppliers even more

sure Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday January PM To Kari Dohn Subject RE Additional Materials Its hard to disagree with the fact that the utilities are the ones that cut the deal theyre living with and they took all of the stranded cost money that consumers paid them and invested it in other states and countries But you can only buy for cents and sell for cents for so long before creditors turn off the spigot Difficult to see how the spigot stays on with the draft decision issued today See story attached below With bankruptcy the only one making any decisions is the judge and while some see benefits to that seems to us that from a political financial and commercial perspective bankruptcy creates many more problems than it solves That said were extremely sensitive to the politics of rate increases But if the increases are subject to refund then decision makers can buy themselves some time by erring just slightly to the high side of a rate increase which could fend off the ratings agencies and provide additional opportunity over the next days or so to scrutinize the utilities claims and come up with comprehensive solutions to the bigger problems Well you got my two cents Sorry about that Best Jeff Late afternoon news USA Calif utility ratings may fall too far on pct hike By Jonathan Stempel Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW YORK Jan Reuters Bankruptcy may loom and the credit ratings of the two largest California electric utilities will likely fall too far if that states Public Utilities Commission awards them an interim rate hike of to percent analysts said Wednesday In a draft decision on Wednesday the CPUC proposed an immediate hike of percent for residential customers of Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison and hikes of seven to percent for various business customers The CPUC commission is expected to issue a final decision on Thursday It forces the utilities and their creditors to be limbo dancers and skilled limbo dancers at that said Shawn Burke head of US investmentgrade research at Barclays Capital PGE and SCE had requested respective rate increases of percent and percent a hike that would help them avoid imminent bankruptcy The utilities have also asked the regulators to remove a freeze on retail rates imposed under Californias law that deregulated the states electricity market On a day when most stocks roared ahead after the Federal Reserve announced surprise interest rate cuts investors beat down the stocks of Pacific GEs parent San Franciscobased PGE Corp and SoCal Edisons parent Edison International PGE shares closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at down or percent while Edison International shares closed at down or percent on the Big Board Bond quotations were not immediately available for the utilities bonds which in recent weeks have traded like junk Pacific GE and SoCal Edison were banking on a big rate hike to allow them to pass on some of their soaring wholesale power costs to consumers The utilities which operate under a rate freeze have accumulated more than billion in unrecovered costs since wholesale power prices started skyrocketing last summer amid a worsening electricity shortage in the state They claim they are running out of money due to the price freeze and have billions of dollars of bills coming due in the next six weeks Central to their concerns is whether credit rating agencies Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors will cut their medium investment grades to junk status No one knows for sure but if we consider the average rate hike is only about percent it will be difficult for the companies to maintain investmentgrade ratings said Dorothea Matthews a fixedincome electric utilities analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex Brown The utilities have already been unable to tap shortterm capital markets because of their precarious financial state Downgrades to junk which the agencies have already threatened would cement the door shut to these markets and cause the utilities to default on some of their loans Late Wednesday PGE Chief Executive Gordon Smith said the commissions proposed hikes could jeopardize his utilitys future loans Even a downgrade to the lowest investment grades Baa for longterm debt and Prime for shortterm debt from Moodys and BBBminus and A from SP would make the going very difficult for the utilities The reason shortterm debt markets are often closed to companies with those ratings Unless this process allows the rating agencies to keep AP ratings on the shortterm debt of both companies then this process has largely been a waste of everyones time said Burke Still he said there is a reasonable chance despite todays weak recommendation that the situation can be salvaged with midtripleB ratings which would allow a lifeline to conventional sources of liquidity Moodys and SP were not available for comment Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Kari Dohn Kari O To VCAGOV cc Subject
