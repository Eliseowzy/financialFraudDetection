Touche Fremont Street San Francisco CA phone fax email Original Message From Anil Sama mailto Sent Wednesday February AM To Mark Guinney Cc Subject Re Re HD Case Proposed Plan All I was thinking along similar lines HD should moderate growth in the coming year only invest in opening new stores in locations with the highest estimated ROI or perhaps those that arethe most complete since there is some construction in progress already to reduce any incremental expense Focus instead on improving operating efficiencies which have been steadily deteriorating to increase investor confidencestock price Then expand via another public offering at a later date Sarah had asked in class to lookinto whether HD was going to be able to make payroll in the coming year I tried to do this assuming no expansion freeze all construction in progress Using Marks spreadsheet and backing out the new store acquisition costs and reducing inventories that would have been part of the new stores this still leaves a cash need from financing of mil in order to meet operational needs So theyare going to need to tap into credit lines for at least this amount regardless I will be in class tonight If you have a conf call could we do it at If we do please send across details before PM or else you can just leave me a voice mail on my cell at and Ill retrieve it during break Anil Mark Guinney wrote Jeff I assume you can coordinate a conference call from work Call me at home Excellent points and I was thinking along similar lines Questions I have How do you know that LT debt gives more advantageous terms We have no yield curve info nor do we know their credit rating At what point does their borrowing exceed their covenents Is our strategy to not raise the required million or to stopslow PPE spending so that the m is not needed Mark D Guinney CFA Consultant Watson Wyatt Investment Consulting California Street Ste San Francisco CA ph fax Reply Separator Subject Re HD Case Proposed Plan Author Date AM Hi folks Since we have only one page the write up for number will have to be very brief Before writing it though I wanted to offer a few bullets regarding what angle we might take and let folks respond comment counter etc before writing it up Ill clean and beef up once weve agreed to the approach wed like to take to question Finally I can work from my office on this this evening which means that I can use the conference call capability of my office phone to patch everyone in if wed like to do a conference call If thats what folks would like to do Id prefer to do the call at around PM Just let me know Best Jeff The question for is Stock price is down significant debt has already been tapped to support massive growth and covenants on that debt restrict taking on a lot more debt What should HD do wrt current operations and future growth strategy In the near term focus less on growth and more on getting margins and EBIT growth back in line with results from previous years Managements Letter to Shareholders alludes to this but its difficult to determine whether management is just paying lip service to the need to capitalize on the growth spurt and grown earnings or continue on the growth effort With respect to funding future more moderate growth the company does have some room to increase longterm debt eg current ratio for It seems that HD would get better terms and have increased flexibility by issuing additional debt rather than relying on lines of credit As such HD ought to look those sources of funding and fill in any funding gaps with funds from the line of credit Given the significant drop in stock price HD is likely better off in the near term moderating growth improving performance to generate cash internally and using longterm debt issuance to provide the funds needed Once performance and stock price improves then HD should consider a stock issuance How can company improve operating performance Reduce selling store operating expenses and preopening expenses Improve receivables turnover Improve inventory turnover Improve per storesales Consider closing poorperforming stores All of which will improve margins Should company change its strategy If so how Shift from meteoric growth to moderate targeted growth and focus on generating positive cash flow from operations Focus on improving performance at existing stores specifically focus on controlling costs and asset turnover and productivity Consider another debt issuance rather than rely extensively on credit line in order to decrease cost of funds and increase flexibilit Do

is again but now revised to reflect your email comments sent around today accurately i hope look forward to discussing with all at cv Carolyn M Vavrek Manager Human Capital Advisory Services Deloitte Touche Fremont Street San Francisco CA phone fax email Original Message From Anil Sama mailto Sent Wednesday February AM To Mark Guinney Cc Subject Re Re HD Case Proposed Plan All I was thinking along similar lines HD should moderate growth in the coming year only invest in opening new stores in locations with the highest estimated ROI or perhaps those that arethe most complete since there is some construction in progress already to reduce any incremental expense Focus instead on improving operating efficiencies which have been steadily deteriorating to increase investor confidencestock price Then expand via another public offering at a later date Sarah had asked in class to lookinto whether HD was going to be able to make payroll in the coming year I tried to do this assuming no expansion freeze all construction in progress Using Marks spreadsheet and backing out the new store acquisition costs and reducing inventories that would have been part of the new stores this still leaves a cash need from financing of mil in order to meet operational needs So theyare going to need to tap into credit lines for at least this amount regardless I will be in class tonight If you have a conf call could we do it at If we do please send across details before PM or else you can just leave me a voice mail on my cell at and Ill retrieve it during break Anil Mark Guinney wrote Jeff I assume you can coordinate a conference call from work Call me at home Excellent points and I was thinking along similar lines Questions I have How do you know that LT debt gives more advantageous terms We have no yield curve info nor do we know their credit rating At what point does their borrowing exceed their covenents Is our strategy to not raise the required million or to stopslow PPE spending so that the m is not needed Mark D Guinney CFA Consultant Watson Wyatt Investment Consulting California Street Ste San Francisco CA ph fax Reply Separator Subject Re HD Case Proposed Plan Author Date AM Hi folks Since we have only one page the write up for number will have to be very brief Before writing it though I wanted to offer a few bullets regarding what angle we might take and let folks respond comment counter etc before writing it up Ill clean and beef up once weve agreed to the approach wed like to take to question Finally I can work from my office on this this evening which means that I can use the conference call capability of my office phone to patch everyone in if wed like to do a conference call If thats what folks would like to do Id prefer to do the call at around PM Just let me know Best Jeff The question for is Stock price is down significant debt has already been tapped to support massive growth and covenants on that debt restrict taking on a lot more debt What should HD do wrt current operations and future growth strategy In the near term focus less on growth and more on getting margins and EBIT growth back in line with results from previous years Managements Letter to Shareholders alludes to this but its difficult to determine whether management is just paying lip service to the need to capitalize on the growth spurt and grown earnings or continue on the growth effort With respect to funding future more moderate growth the company does have some room to increase longterm debt eg current ratio for It seems that HD would get better terms and have increased flexibility by issuing additional debt rather than relying on lines of credit As such HD ought to look those sources of funding and fill in any funding gaps with funds from the line of credit Given the significant drop in stock price HD is likely better off in the near term moderating growth improving performance to generate cash internally and using longterm debt issuance to provide the funds needed Once performance and stock price improves then HD should consider a stock issuance How can company improve operating performance Reduce selling store operating expenses and preopening expenses Improve receivables turnover Improve inventory turnover Improve per storesales Consider closing poorperforming stores All of which will improve margins Should company change its strategy If so how Shift from meteoric growth to moderate targeted growth and focus on generating positive cash flow from operations Focus on improving performance at existing stores specifically focus on controlling costs and asset turnover and productivity Consider another debt issuance rather than rely extensively on credit line in order to decrease cost of funds and increase flexibilit Do
