energy secretary ordering power generators to sell power to California With BCCAPower WoesGlance slasmt By STEVE LAWRENCE Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO AP US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday he would force power generators to sell electricity to California to prevent rolling blackouts The announcement came as California power regulators warned of the likelihood of a Stage Three power alert with rotating blackouts Wednesday afternoon due to trouble buying electricity from the Northwest About a dozen suppliers were demanding cash before selling power to California due to concerns about the utilities solvency said Kellan Fluckiger chief operating officer of the Independent System Operator keeper of the states electrical grid Californias two largest utilities Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison are near bankruptcy due to skyrocketing wholesale power costs Gov Gray Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said at a Washington DC news conference with Richardson Richardson said he was using emergency powers to force wholesalers to sell power to California at a price he deemed fair He said he would also request that two large Pacific Northwest power generating associations generate more power to send to California Davis and Feinstein also asked federal regulators to set a regional price cap on wholesale electricity to prevent the high prices that have plagued California On Friday the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission lifted price caps in California Record wholesale power prices followed and PGE warned it was in financial danger The credit limits of utilities and what markets are willing to sell us have been reached and surpassed in many cases Fluckiger said There are questions about utility solvency That has come to a head today He said officials may have to interrupt power to about a million customers Wednesday afternoon and then increase the blackouts to cover three million or four million in late afternoon and early evening when people come home from work and power demand hits a peak Steve Hansen a spokesman for Southern California Edison whose territory includes metropolitan Los Angeles but not the city said the utility had not ordered blackouts by early afternoon We have heard that it may not be as bad as we thought here he said Were waiting for some kind of official word from the ISO or somebody An unprecedented Stage Three emergency was issued last Thursday meaning reserves had fallen below percent In that case the state fended off the threat of rolling outages by turning off two powersucking water pumps on the Delta California is heavily importdependent and had been for years This is a Westwide problem Fluckiger said Blackouts if used would probably last about an hour to minutes and occur mostly in Northern California due to transmission limitations there Fluckiger said Its a fairly bleak picture he said adding that the chances of blackouts were better than This thing will not change unless something is done to alleviate the credit situation Contributing to the problem was a shortage of water to power hydroelectric generators in the Northwest and California Fluckiger said We have reservoirs so low that we have people standing by them watching the situation to make sure it does not go below safe limits he said Gasfired generators could be brought on line to ease the situation but natural gas prices are so high they would not cover the operating costs Fluckiger said Requests have been made to operate those facilities and then have the utilities pay for those excess gas costs Fluckiger said The utilities have not been able to do so They have requested permission from the PUC to be able to pass those costs through to customers Utilities would decide who would face blackouts he said They try to avoid areas with essential services such as hospitals Fluckiger said Californias power market has been hit for months by tight supplies and price spikes Electricity deregulation cold weather and rising power costs have been blamed for the states most recent problems California approved a phasedin deregulation of the electricity market in to try to lower prices for consumers through competition but so far it has led to higher energy prices The Northwest heavily dependent on hydroelectric power has faced low water tables and had to import electricity from California and other states And wholesale power costs have been soaring due in large part to skyrocketing prices for natural gas Wall Street is worried about utilities economic health and on Tuesday a consumer group urged the state to seize and run the strapped billion electricity system A Stage One alert was declared Wednesday morning meaning power reserves were below percent and all power users are asked to conserve Stage One and Stage Two emergencies in which power reserves fall below percent have become routine this month but last Thursdays Stage Three was the only time the threat of blackouts loomed EDITORS NOTE Associated Press writer Bart Jansen in Washington contributed to this report APWS EST

Navin PM To Cynthia NRON cc Subject CQ Weekly article on electricity restructuring Heres the electronic version of the electricity restructuring article that will appear in Mondays CQ Weekly in case you would like to forward there is a hard copy in your box CQ WEEKLY ENERGY Apr Page Pressure Surges to a New High To Legislate Electric Deregulation By James C Benton CQ Staff At the dawn of the year it seemed Congress would be content to let the current session end without moving legislation to encourage further deregulation of the nations billion electric market But developments in the past few weeks suggest that groups interested in seeing deregulation as well as the Clinton administration are building a consensus that will put pressure on Congress to move some kind of bill this year On April a group called the Electricity Restructuring Stakeholders representing consumers electric generating companies senior citizens and others released a set of goals they believe should be included in restructuring legislation The principles include repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of PUHCA and changes to a law PL that required state utility commissions and utilities to reform their electric rates and take other measures to even out daily electric consumption CQ Almanac p The group plans to meet with environmental groups and regulators to identify other areas where common ground can be reached said Joe Nipper chief lobbyist for the American Public Power Association A smaller trade group composed mainly of investorowned utilities is working on its own set of principles Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the stakeholder progress in an April speech to the National Energy Marketers Association and he urged Congress to pass an electric restructuring bill Our interstate electricity markets are in need of repair Richardson said adding that transmission access and generation capacity are decreasing as demand for electricity grows If Congress fails to act and act soon on restructuring legislation it will strangle the development of competitive electricity markets The two committee chairmen who will have to spearhead a restructuring plan have stated their intent to pass a bill by the end of the th Congress But they must navigate past obstacles that include the compressed calendar electionyear politics and a general lack of knowledge among their colleagues on how to rewrite or repeal PUHCA On April Senate Energy Chairman Frank H Murkowski RAlaska will hold the last of three hearings on eight electric deregulationrelated measures On the House side retiring Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J Bliley Jr RVa has vowed to work toward enacting a bill HR to encourage further state deregulation of the electric utility market That measure which would effectively allow consumers to buy their power from anyone not just the nearest utility was approved by the House Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Power on Oct CQ Weekly p CQ Weekly p The bill also would give states the authority to handle their transition to a competitive market but contains no deadline or date certain by which states would have to restructure Moving a Senate Bill Some are skeptical that the political and practical hurdles can be overcome this year For example while they have made progress on principles the key negotiators representing investorowned utilities electric cooperatives municipal electric utilities large electricity consumers labor unions and environmental groups still must reach consensus on details the legislation should address as well as the legislative language to implement any agreement I think the chances of getting a bill enacted this year are low not from the lack of trying Nipper said The best chance appears to lie in the Senate where Murkowskis committee is considering eight bills I am committed to getting something meaningful out of my committee Murkowski said in an April interview Murkowski acknowledged though that the congressional schedule and narrow consensus on each of the bills pose challenges to his goal developing a comprehensive deregulation bill not one that only addresses portions of electric restructuring The path in the House appears more difficult although one key supporter said there is behindthescenes movement Bliley has promised to hold a markup of HR before Memorial Day and he has named a task force of six members to help move the bill through committee Joe L Barton RTexas the sponsor of HR said meetings are taking place among Bliley Republican House staffers and some interested groups There is some action its just not visible Barton said late last month I think whats happening there is that stakeholders are jockeying for position Barton said he anticipated that a fairly good bill could be moved by the middle of May if stakeholders and members come together One complication Democrats in the midst of the battle to regain control of the House may not move toward a consensus with Republicans Staff aides for several Democratic members have already complained they have not heard from the committee staff in trying to work out differences raised in subcommittee But others point to a energy law PL that cleared Congress in the weeks before that years election It contained provisions allowing utilities and independent producers to compete in the wholesale power market that law has been credited with the current wave of deregulation in some markets So far states and the District of Columbia have either restructured their markets or enacted laws to begin retail competition in coming years Almanac p Mark Stultz a spokesman for the Electric Power Supply Association a group of competitive power suppliers and power marketers said the law was enacted after the electric industry quickly built up a consensus among members and educated them on what the bill would do The industry was able to access that in a very short time Stultz said As far as getting a restructuring bill through this year Stultz said it is not an impossible unrealizable goal to assume that we could get consensus since key stakeholders have reached agreement on several issues They include blocking market power the ability of a few companies to stunt competition by effectively using its assets to manipulate the deregulated market to its advantage While the House bill contains many issues stakeholders agree with Stultz said it also contains some fatal flaws He cited as an example its lack of federal agency jurisdiction over bundled services in a regulated market in which electric generation transmission and distribution rates are combined in an electric bill and unbundled services in a deregulated market in which the generation rates are broken apart from transmission and distribution rates and other temporary charges brought on by deregulation are included Best Bets in the Senate Of the eight bills pending in the Senate Nipper said the one with the best chance of passing is S sponsored by Slade Gorton RWash which is intended to encourage greater electric reliability Nipper said the Gorton bill would replace the North American Electric Reliability Council a group in which utility participation is voluntary with the Electric Reliability Organization a board that would require participation by utilities The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would have jurisdiction over the board as well as the power to enforce its policies on utilities The reliability issue is likely to intensify in coming months due to problems electric utilities faced each of the past two summers While some plants were undergoing needed maintenance some utilities were caught with their generation capacity down during periods of extremely high demand The resulting shortage triggered a spike in bulk electric prices driving the price of a megawatthour of electricity in a few places from to as high as Utilities enforced rotating blackouts on customers asked consumers to reduce electric use and passed on surcharges for the higher cost of electricity Hoping to avoid outages this summer the Department of Energy has scheduled four regional summits on electric reliability on April and Jim Owen a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute said a third consecutive summer of service interruptions and significant price increases could motivate Congress to move on the deregulation bill It might push this thing up further on the congressional radar screen although a law enacted immediately would not have a quick impact on generation and transmission reliability he said Other thorny issues include How to handle taxation issues between publicly owned utilities electric cooperatives and municipal utilities and whether utilities should voluntarily join or be forced to join regional transmission organizations designed to allow more efficient transfer of electricity across the national grid Whether the federal government should be involved in regulating the interstate transmission of electric power Some stakeholders argue federal regulation is necessary to prevent one state or region from protecting its customers at the expense of others Environmental groups desire for stronger antipollution restrictions on utilities that produce pollutants while generating electricity And labor groups wary that deregulation could trigger massive layoffs through corporate mergers and acquisitions want to make sure their union members are protected

Affairs group Thank you Congress continues to advance the Electricity Restructuring Legislative debate On Tuesday June th the Senate Energy Committee plans to markup and pass Senator Gortons Reliability bill including the consensus state savings clause language Attached below attachment jtstwpd is the page joint Senate staff draft which represents agreement in many areas but the differences remain significant No agreement was reachable at this time in Committee on the extent of FERC jurisdiction to prevent unreasonable differences between wholesale and retail service nor reached on the RPS Although the page draft includes language on PURPA Reciprocity Consumer Protection Interconnection etc currently only two Senators support the additional language included in the pages thus the only chance of moving through the Senate Energy Committee this year is to pass Reliabilityonly now With the makeup of the Senate Energy Committee our strategy is to do no harm in committee thus making the reliability languageonly option acceptable as a means to an end Enron does support the Reliability bill but we will insist on adding transmission access and functional separation language later in the process while EEI will insist on adding PUHCA while APPA will insist on adding Private Use thus we can see what the final consensus will look like plus we have been involved in drafting the consensus in all these provisionsbut timing and sequence are crucial It might be helpful to remind everyone that the bills leading up to the Energy Policy Act of as passed by the Committees were also amended in Conference since it was impossible to garner the necessary Committee votes or survive a Senate filibuster with any Committeeincluded wheeling language Transmission wheeling access language was successfully added in Conference Thus the sequence of adding our necessary provisions remains key to a successful strategy then as it does now Also attached is Chairman Blileys Reliability and Transmission discussion draft section by section summary and PDF This is the foundation from which he is willing to add additional consensus amendments From Enrons view this foundation draft is our exact wish list to clarify FERC jurisdiction over both bundled and unbundled transmission although we have suggested a few technical drafting points which have already been conveyed to staff It is important for all of us to convey our support for this draft as the essential foundation for the bill Markup will likely be scheduled to occur during the week of June th It is important to note that Subcommittee Chairman Barton is philosophically opposed to the BlileyEnron proFERC approach As such he has asked Texas PUC Chairman Pat Wood and Oklahoma Corporate Commission Chairwoman Denise Bode to draft a compromise to lighten the FERC authority in favor of a more Regional Approach I just got off the phone with Pat who walked me through the draft he was submitting this evening to Barton once it is officially transmitted I will be able to get a copy to you likely on Monday or Tuesday From Pats description we should be able to be supportive since he shares our views about wholesale markets needing federal authority He discussed a draft that mandates RTO participation a seven point mandatory RTO test filed at FERC in days after enactment Ratemaking established by the state but allowing FERC appeal allowing FERC appeal if rds disagree State authority but also ongoing FERC authority with an expedited dispute resolution process The seven point mandatory filing details are full wholesale competition under the same terms rates and conditions RTO sole functional control of transmission functional separation of generation from transmission curtailment on nondiscriminatory basis all transmission uses disclosed and transparent constant assessment of construction needs and remedy and emergency authority for dispute resolution He mentioned Denises insistence for interconnection on a nondiscriminatory basis which he feels is adequately addressed in their draft From Pats discussions with Reliant on his draft they again spoke in support of Enrons transmission open access goals TXU remains concerned that ERCOT will be pulled under FERC jurisdiction in the draft But it is Pats view that this already has happened under the state law Our goal next week is to lockin bipartisan House Committee support and House Leadership support for the markup plus tighten the markup process so it is transparent to all plus to pass the Senate Committee bill A bill to meet our established goals is still doable this year My strategy was always based upon the necessity to lead with the reliability language in order to create a legislative vehicle for us to include our nondiscriminatory transmission access provisions Please call should you need clarification or have questions Many thanks for your continued support sectionbysectionwpd summarydocwpd PDF

Affairs group Thank you Congress continues to advance the Electricity Restructuring Legislative debate On Tuesday June th the Senate Energy Committee plans to markup and pass Senator Gortons Reliability bill including the consensus state savings clause language Attached below attachment jtstwpd is the page joint Senate staff draft which represents agreement in many areas but the differences remain significant No agreement was reachable at this time in Committee on the extent of FERC jurisdiction to prevent unreasonable differences between wholesale and retail service nor reached on the RPS Although the page draft includes language on PURPA Reciprocity Consumer Protection Interconnection etc currently only two Senators support the additional language included in the pages thus the only chance of moving through the Senate Energy Committee this year is to pass Reliabilityonly now With the makeup of the Senate Energy Committee our strategy is to do no harm in committee thus making the reliability languageonly option acceptable as a means to an end Enron does support the Reliability bill but we will insist on adding transmission access and functional separation language later in the process while EEI will insist on adding PUHCA while APPA will insist on adding Private Use thus we can see what the final consensus will look like plus we have been involved in drafting the consensus in all these provisionsbut timing and sequence are crucial It might be helpful to remind everyone that the bills leading up to the Energy Policy Act of as passed by the Committees were also amended in Conference since it was impossible to garner the necessary Committee votes or survive a Senate filibuster with any Committeeincluded wheeling language Transmission wheeling access language was successfully added in Conference Thus the sequence of adding our necessary provisions remains key to a successful strategy then as it does now Also attached is Chairman Blileys Reliability and Transmission discussion draft section by section summary and PDF This is the foundation from which he is willing to add additional consensus amendments From Enrons view this foundation draft is our exact wish list to clarify FERC jurisdiction over both bundled and unbundled transmission although we have suggested a few technical drafting points which have already been conveyed to staff It is important for all of us to convey our support for this draft as the essential foundation for the bill Markup will likely be scheduled to occur during the week of June th It is important to note that Subcommittee Chairman Barton is philosophically opposed to the BlileyEnron proFERC approach As such he has asked Texas PUC Chairman Pat Wood and Oklahoma Corporate Commission Chairwoman Denise Bode to draft a compromise to lighten the FERC authority in favor of a more Regional Approach I just got off the phone with Pat who walked me through the draft he was submitting this evening to Barton once it is officially transmitted I will be able to get a copy to you likely on Monday or Tuesday From Pats description we should be able to be supportive since he shares our views about wholesale markets needing federal authority He discussed a draft that mandates RTO participation a seven point mandatory RTO test filed at FERC in days after enactment Ratemaking established by the state but allowing FERC appeal allowing FERC appeal if rds disagree State authority but also ongoing FERC authority with an expedited dispute resolution process The seven point mandatory filing details are full wholesale competition under the same terms rates and conditions RTO sole functional control of transmission functional separation of generation from transmission curtailment on nondiscriminatory basis all transmission uses disclosed and transparent constant assessment of construction needs and remedy and emergency authority for dispute resolution He mentioned Denises insistence for interconnection on a nondiscriminatory basis which he feels is adequately addressed in their draft From Pats discussions with Reliant on his draft they again spoke in support of Enrons transmission open access goals TXU remains concerned that ERCOT will be pulled under FERC jurisdiction in the draft But it is Pats view that this already has happened under the state law Our goal next week is to lockin bipartisan House Committee support and House Leadership support for the markup plus tighten the markup process so it is transparent to all plus to pass the Senate Committee bill A bill to meet our established goals is still doable this year My strategy was always based upon the necessity to lead with the reliability language in order to create a legislative vehicle for us to include our nondiscriminatory transmission access provisions Please call should you need clarification or have questions Many thanks for your continued support sectionbysectionwpd summarydocwpd PDF

Navin PM To Cynthia NRON cc Subject CQ Weekly article on electricity restructuring Heres the electronic version of the electricity restructuring article that will appear in Mondays CQ Weekly in case you would like to forward there is a hard copy in your box CQ WEEKLY ENERGY Apr Page Pressure Surges to a New High To Legislate Electric Deregulation By James C Benton CQ Staff At the dawn of the year it seemed Congress would be content to let the current session end without moving legislation to encourage further deregulation of the nations billion electric market But developments in the past few weeks suggest that groups interested in seeing deregulation as well as the Clinton administration are building a consensus that will put pressure on Congress to move some kind of bill this year On April a group called the Electricity Restructuring Stakeholders representing consumers electric generating companies senior citizens and others released a set of goals they believe should be included in restructuring legislation The principles include repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of PUHCA and changes to a law PL that required state utility commissions and utilities to reform their electric rates and take other measures to even out daily electric consumption CQ Almanac p The group plans to meet with environmental groups and regulators to identify other areas where common ground can be reached said Joe Nipper chief lobbyist for the American Public Power Association A smaller trade group composed mainly of investorowned utilities is working on its own set of principles Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the stakeholder progress in an April speech to the National Energy Marketers Association and he urged Congress to pass an electric restructuring bill Our interstate electricity markets are in need of repair Richardson said adding that transmission access and generation capacity are decreasing as demand for electricity grows If Congress fails to act and act soon on restructuring legislation it will strangle the development of competitive electricity markets The two committee chairmen who will have to spearhead a restructuring plan have stated their intent to pass a bill by the end of the th Congress But they must navigate past obstacles that include the compressed calendar electionyear politics and a general lack of knowledge among their colleagues on how to rewrite or repeal PUHCA On April Senate Energy Chairman Frank H Murkowski RAlaska will hold the last of three hearings on eight electric deregulationrelated measures On the House side retiring Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J Bliley Jr RVa has vowed to work toward enacting a bill HR to encourage further state deregulation of the electric utility market That measure which would effectively allow consumers to buy their power from anyone not just the nearest utility was approved by the House Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Power on Oct CQ Weekly p CQ Weekly p The bill also would give states the authority to handle their transition to a competitive market but contains no deadline or date certain by which states would have to restructure Moving a Senate Bill Some are skeptical that the political and practical hurdles can be overcome this year For example while they have made progress on principles the key negotiators representing investorowned utilities electric cooperatives municipal electric utilities large electricity consumers labor unions and environmental groups still must reach consensus on details the legislation should address as well as the legislative language to implement any agreement I think the chances of getting a bill enacted this year are low not from the lack of trying Nipper said The best chance appears to lie in the Senate where Murkowskis committee is considering eight bills I am committed to getting something meaningful out of my committee Murkowski said in an April interview Murkowski acknowledged though that the congressional schedule and narrow consensus on each of the bills pose challenges to his goal developing a comprehensive deregulation bill not one that only addresses portions of electric restructuring The path in the House appears more difficult although one key supporter said there is behindthescenes movement Bliley has promised to hold a markup of HR before Memorial Day and he has named a task force of six members to help move the bill through committee Joe L Barton RTexas the sponsor of HR said meetings are taking place among Bliley Republican House staffers and some interested groups There is some action its just not visible Barton said late last month I think whats happening there is that stakeholders are jockeying for position Barton said he anticipated that a fairly good bill could be moved by the middle of May if stakeholders and members come together One complication Democrats in the midst of the battle to regain control of the House may not move toward a consensus with Republicans Staff aides for several Democratic members have already complained they have not heard from the committee staff in trying to work out differences raised in subcommittee But others point to a energy law PL that cleared Congress in the weeks before that years election It contained provisions allowing utilities and independent producers to compete in the wholesale power market that law has been credited with the current wave of deregulation in some markets So far states and the District of Columbia have either restructured their markets or enacted laws to begin retail competition in coming years Almanac p Mark Stultz a spokesman for the Electric Power Supply Association a group of competitive power suppliers and power marketers said the law was enacted after the electric industry quickly built up a consensus among members and educated them on what the bill would do The industry was able to access that in a very short time Stultz said As far as getting a restructuring bill through this year Stultz said it is not an impossible unrealizable goal to assume that we could get consensus since key stakeholders have reached agreement on several issues They include blocking market power the ability of a few companies to stunt competition by effectively using its assets to manipulate the deregulated market to its advantage While the House bill contains many issues stakeholders agree with Stultz said it also contains some fatal flaws He cited as an example its lack of federal agency jurisdiction over bundled services in a regulated market in which electric generation transmission and distribution rates are combined in an electric bill and unbundled services in a deregulated market in which the generation rates are broken apart from transmission and distribution rates and other temporary charges brought on by deregulation are included Best Bets in the Senate Of the eight bills pending in the Senate Nipper said the one with the best chance of passing is S sponsored by Slade Gorton RWash which is intended to encourage greater electric reliability Nipper said the Gorton bill would replace the North American Electric Reliability Council a group in which utility participation is voluntary with the Electric Reliability Organization a board that would require participation by utilities The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would have jurisdiction over the board as well as the power to enforce its policies on utilities The reliability issue is likely to intensify in coming months due to problems electric utilities faced each of the past two summers While some plants were undergoing needed maintenance some utilities were caught with their generation capacity down during periods of extremely high demand The resulting shortage triggered a spike in bulk electric prices driving the price of a megawatthour of electricity in a few places from to as high as Utilities enforced rotating blackouts on customers asked consumers to reduce electric use and passed on surcharges for the higher cost of electricity Hoping to avoid outages this summer the Department of Energy has scheduled four regional summits on electric reliability on April and Jim Owen a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute said a third consecutive summer of service interruptions and significant price increases could motivate Congress to move on the deregulation bill It might push this thing up further on the congressional radar screen although a law enacted immediately would not have a quick impact on generation and transmission reliability he said Other thorny issues include How to handle taxation issues between publicly owned utilities electric cooperatives and municipal utilities and whether utilities should voluntarily join or be forced to join regional transmission organizations designed to allow more efficient transfer of electricity across the national grid Whether the federal government should be involved in regulating the interstate transmission of electric power Some stakeholders argue federal regulation is necessary to prevent one state or region from protecting its customers at the expense of others Environmental groups desire for stronger antipollution restrictions on utilities that produce pollutants while generating electricity And labor groups wary that deregulation could trigger massive layoffs through corporate mergers and acquisitions want to make sure their union members are protected

energy secretary ordering power generators to sell power to California With BCCAPower WoesGlance slasmt By STEVE LAWRENCE Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO AP US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday he would force power generators to sell electricity to California to prevent rolling blackouts The announcement came as California power regulators warned of the likelihood of a Stage Three power alert with rotating blackouts Wednesday afternoon due to trouble buying electricity from the Northwest About a dozen suppliers were demanding cash before selling power to California due to concerns about the utilities solvency said Kellan Fluckiger chief operating officer of the Independent System Operator keeper of the states electrical grid Californias two largest utilities Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison are near bankruptcy due to skyrocketing wholesale power costs Gov Gray Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said at a Washington DC news conference with Richardson Richardson said he was using emergency powers to force wholesalers to sell power to California at a price he deemed fair He said he would also request that two large Pacific Northwest power generating associations generate more power to send to California Davis and Feinstein also asked federal regulators to set a regional price cap on wholesale electricity to prevent the high prices that have plagued California On Friday the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission lifted price caps in California Record wholesale power prices followed and PGE warned it was in financial danger The credit limits of utilities and what markets are willing to sell us have been reached and surpassed in many cases Fluckiger said There are questions about utility solvency That has come to a head today He said officials may have to interrupt power to about a million customers Wednesday afternoon and then increase the blackouts to cover three million or four million in late afternoon and early evening when people come home from work and power demand hits a peak Steve Hansen a spokesman for Southern California Edison whose territory includes metropolitan Los Angeles but not the city said the utility had not ordered blackouts by early afternoon We have heard that it may not be as bad as we thought here he said Were waiting for some kind of official word from the ISO or somebody An unprecedented Stage Three emergency was issued last Thursday meaning reserves had fallen below percent In that case the state fended off the threat of rolling outages by turning off two powersucking water pumps on the Delta California is heavily importdependent and had been for years This is a Westwide problem Fluckiger said Blackouts if used would probably last about an hour to minutes and occur mostly in Northern California due to transmission limitations there Fluckiger said Its a fairly bleak picture he said adding that the chances of blackouts were better than This thing will not change unless something is done to alleviate the credit situation Contributing to the problem was a shortage of water to power hydroelectric generators in the Northwest and California Fluckiger said We have reservoirs so low that we have people standing by them watching the situation to make sure it does not go below safe limits he said Gasfired generators could be brought on line to ease the situation but natural gas prices are so high they would not cover the operating costs Fluckiger said Requests have been made to operate those facilities and then have the utilities pay for those excess gas costs Fluckiger said The utilities have not been able to do so They have requested permission from the PUC to be able to pass those costs through to customers Utilities would decide who would face blackouts he said They try to avoid areas with essential services such as hospitals Fluckiger said Californias power market has been hit for months by tight supplies and price spikes Electricity deregulation cold weather and rising power costs have been blamed for the states most recent problems California approved a phasedin deregulation of the electricity market in to try to lower prices for consumers through competition but so far it has led to higher energy prices The Northwest heavily dependent on hydroelectric power has faced low water tables and had to import electricity from California and other states And wholesale power costs have been soaring due in large part to skyrocketing prices for natural gas Wall Street is worried about utilities economic health and on Tuesday a consumer group urged the state to seize and run the strapped billion electricity system A Stage One alert was declared Wednesday morning meaning power reserves were below percent and all power users are asked to conserve Stage One and Stage Two emergencies in which power reserves fall below percent have become routine this month but last Thursdays Stage Three was the only time the threat of blackouts loomed EDITORS NOTE Associated Press writer Bart Jansen in Washington contributed to this report APWS EST

Affairs group Thank you Congress continues to advance the Electricity Restructuring Legislative debate On Tuesday June th the Senate Energy Committee plans to markup and pass Senator Gortons Reliability bill including the consensus state savings clause language Attached below attachment jtstwpd is the page joint Senate staff draft which represents agreement in many areas but the differences remain significant No agreement was reachable at this time in Committee on the extent of FERC jurisdiction to prevent unreasonable differences between wholesale and retail service nor reached on the RPS Although the page draft includes language on PURPA Reciprocity Consumer Protection Interconnection etc currently only two Senators support the additional language included in the pages thus the only chance of moving through the Senate Energy Committee this year is to pass Reliabilityonly now With the makeup of the Senate Energy Committee our strategy is to do no harm in committee thus making the reliability languageonly option acceptable as a means to an end Enron does support the Reliability bill but we will insist on adding transmission access and functional separation language later in the process while EEI will insist on adding PUHCA while APPA will insist on adding Private Use thus we can see what the final consensus will look like plus we have been involved in drafting the consensus in all these provisionsbut timing and sequence are crucial It might be helpful to remind everyone that the bills leading up to the Energy Policy Act of as passed by the Committees were also amended in Conference since it was impossible to garner the necessary Committee votes or survive a Senate filibuster with any Committeeincluded wheeling language Transmission wheeling access language was successfully added in Conference Thus the sequence of adding our necessary provisions remains key to a successful strategy then as it does now Also attached is Chairman Blileys Reliability and Transmission discussion draft section by section summary and PDF This is the foundation from which he is willing to add additional consensus amendments From Enrons view this foundation draft is our exact wish list to clarify FERC jurisdiction over both bundled and unbundled transmission although we have suggested a few technical drafting points which have already been conveyed to staff It is important for all of us to convey our support for this draft as the essential foundation for the bill Markup will likely be scheduled to occur during the week of June th It is important to note that Subcommittee Chairman Barton is philosophically opposed to the BlileyEnron proFERC approach As such he has asked Texas PUC Chairman Pat Wood and Oklahoma Corporate Commission Chairwoman Denise Bode to draft a compromise to lighten the FERC authority in favor of a more Regional Approach I just got off the phone with Pat who walked me through the draft he was submitting this evening to Barton once it is officially transmitted I will be able to get a copy to you likely on Monday or Tuesday From Pats description we should be able to be supportive since he shares our views about wholesale markets needing federal authority He discussed a draft that mandates RTO participation a seven point mandatory RTO test filed at FERC in days after enactment Ratemaking established by the state but allowing FERC appeal allowing FERC appeal if rds disagree State authority but also ongoing FERC authority with an expedited dispute resolution process The seven point mandatory filing details are full wholesale competition under the same terms rates and conditions RTO sole functional control of transmission functional separation of generation from transmission curtailment on nondiscriminatory basis all transmission uses disclosed and transparent constant assessment of construction needs and remedy and emergency authority for dispute resolution He mentioned Denises insistence for interconnection on a nondiscriminatory basis which he feels is adequately addressed in their draft From Pats discussions with Reliant on his draft they again spoke in support of Enrons transmission open access goals TXU remains concerned that ERCOT will be pulled under FERC jurisdiction in the draft But it is Pats view that this already has happened under the state law Our goal next week is to lockin bipartisan House Committee support and House Leadership support for the markup plus tighten the markup process so it is transparent to all plus to pass the Senate Committee bill A bill to meet our established goals is still doable this year My strategy was always based upon the necessity to lead with the reliability language in order to create a legislative vehicle for us to include our nondiscriminatory transmission access provisions Please call should you need clarification or have questions Many thanks for your continued support sectionbysectionwpd summarydocwpd PDF

energy secretary ordering power generators to sell power to California With BCCAPower WoesGlance slasmt By STEVE LAWRENCE Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO AP US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday he would force power generators to sell electricity to California to prevent rolling blackouts The announcement came as California power regulators warned of the likelihood of a Stage Three power alert with rotating blackouts Wednesday afternoon due to trouble buying electricity from the Northwest About a dozen suppliers were demanding cash before selling power to California due to concerns about the utilities solvency said Kellan Fluckiger chief operating officer of the Independent System Operator keeper of the states electrical grid Californias two largest utilities Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison are near bankruptcy due to skyrocketing wholesale power costs Gov Gray Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said at a Washington DC news conference with Richardson Richardson said he was using emergency powers to force wholesalers to sell power to California at a price he deemed fair He said he would also request that two large Pacific Northwest power generating associations generate more power to send to California Davis and Feinstein also asked federal regulators to set a regional price cap on wholesale electricity to prevent the high prices that have plagued California On Friday the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission lifted price caps in California Record wholesale power prices followed and PGE warned it was in financial danger The credit limits of utilities and what markets are willing to sell us have been reached and surpassed in many cases Fluckiger said There are questions about utility solvency That has come to a head today He said officials may have to interrupt power to about a million customers Wednesday afternoon and then increase the blackouts to cover three million or four million in late afternoon and early evening when people come home from work and power demand hits a peak Steve Hansen a spokesman for Southern California Edison whose territory includes metropolitan Los Angeles but not the city said the utility had not ordered blackouts by early afternoon We have heard that it may not be as bad as we thought here he said Were waiting for some kind of official word from the ISO or somebody An unprecedented Stage Three emergency was issued last Thursday meaning reserves had fallen below percent In that case the state fended off the threat of rolling outages by turning off two powersucking water pumps on the Delta California is heavily importdependent and had been for years This is a Westwide problem Fluckiger said Blackouts if used would probably last about an hour to minutes and occur mostly in Northern California due to transmission limitations there Fluckiger said Its a fairly bleak picture he said adding that the chances of blackouts were better than This thing will not change unless something is done to alleviate the credit situation Contributing to the problem was a shortage of water to power hydroelectric generators in the Northwest and California Fluckiger said We have reservoirs so low that we have people standing by them watching the situation to make sure it does not go below safe limits he said Gasfired generators could be brought on line to ease the situation but natural gas prices are so high they would not cover the operating costs Fluckiger said Requests have been made to operate those facilities and then have the utilities pay for those excess gas costs Fluckiger said The utilities have not been able to do so They have requested permission from the PUC to be able to pass those costs through to customers Utilities would decide who would face blackouts he said They try to avoid areas with essential services such as hospitals Fluckiger said Californias power market has been hit for months by tight supplies and price spikes Electricity deregulation cold weather and rising power costs have been blamed for the states most recent problems California approved a phasedin deregulation of the electricity market in to try to lower prices for consumers through competition but so far it has led to higher energy prices The Northwest heavily dependent on hydroelectric power has faced low water tables and had to import electricity from California and other states And wholesale power costs have been soaring due in large part to skyrocketing prices for natural gas Wall Street is worried about utilities economic health and on Tuesday a consumer group urged the state to seize and run the strapped billion electricity system A Stage One alert was declared Wednesday morning meaning power reserves were below percent and all power users are asked to conserve Stage One and Stage Two emergencies in which power reserves fall below percent have become routine this month but last Thursdays Stage Three was the only time the threat of blackouts loomed EDITORS NOTE Associated Press writer Bart Jansen in Washington contributed to this report APWS EST

Navin PM To Cynthia NRON cc Subject CQ Weekly article on electricity restructuring Heres the electronic version of the electricity restructuring article that will appear in Mondays CQ Weekly in case you would like to forward there is a hard copy in your box CQ WEEKLY ENERGY Apr Page Pressure Surges to a New High To Legislate Electric Deregulation By James C Benton CQ Staff At the dawn of the year it seemed Congress would be content to let the current session end without moving legislation to encourage further deregulation of the nations billion electric market But developments in the past few weeks suggest that groups interested in seeing deregulation as well as the Clinton administration are building a consensus that will put pressure on Congress to move some kind of bill this year On April a group called the Electricity Restructuring Stakeholders representing consumers electric generating companies senior citizens and others released a set of goals they believe should be included in restructuring legislation The principles include repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of PUHCA and changes to a law PL that required state utility commissions and utilities to reform their electric rates and take other measures to even out daily electric consumption CQ Almanac p The group plans to meet with environmental groups and regulators to identify other areas where common ground can be reached said Joe Nipper chief lobbyist for the American Public Power Association A smaller trade group composed mainly of investorowned utilities is working on its own set of principles Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the stakeholder progress in an April speech to the National Energy Marketers Association and he urged Congress to pass an electric restructuring bill Our interstate electricity markets are in need of repair Richardson said adding that transmission access and generation capacity are decreasing as demand for electricity grows If Congress fails to act and act soon on restructuring legislation it will strangle the development of competitive electricity markets The two committee chairmen who will have to spearhead a restructuring plan have stated their intent to pass a bill by the end of the th Congress But they must navigate past obstacles that include the compressed calendar electionyear politics and a general lack of knowledge among their colleagues on how to rewrite or repeal PUHCA On April Senate Energy Chairman Frank H Murkowski RAlaska will hold the last of three hearings on eight electric deregulationrelated measures On the House side retiring Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J Bliley Jr RVa has vowed to work toward enacting a bill HR to encourage further state deregulation of the electric utility market That measure which would effectively allow consumers to buy their power from anyone not just the nearest utility was approved by the House Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Power on Oct CQ Weekly p CQ Weekly p The bill also would give states the authority to handle their transition to a competitive market but contains no deadline or date certain by which states would have to restructure Moving a Senate Bill Some are skeptical that the political and practical hurdles can be overcome this year For example while they have made progress on principles the key negotiators representing investorowned utilities electric cooperatives municipal electric utilities large electricity consumers labor unions and environmental groups still must reach consensus on details the legislation should address as well as the legislative language to implement any agreement I think the chances of getting a bill enacted this year are low not from the lack of trying Nipper said The best chance appears to lie in the Senate where Murkowskis committee is considering eight bills I am committed to getting something meaningful out of my committee Murkowski said in an April interview Murkowski acknowledged though that the congressional schedule and narrow consensus on each of the bills pose challenges to his goal developing a comprehensive deregulation bill not one that only addresses portions of electric restructuring The path in the House appears more difficult although one key supporter said there is behindthescenes movement Bliley has promised to hold a markup of HR before Memorial Day and he has named a task force of six members to help move the bill through committee Joe L Barton RTexas the sponsor of HR said meetings are taking place among Bliley Republican House staffers and some interested groups There is some action its just not visible Barton said late last month I think whats happening there is that stakeholders are jockeying for position Barton said he anticipated that a fairly good bill could be moved by the middle of May if stakeholders and members come together One complication Democrats in the midst of the battle to regain control of the House may not move toward a consensus with Republicans Staff aides for several Democratic members have already complained they have not heard from the committee staff in trying to work out differences raised in subcommittee But others point to a energy law PL that cleared Congress in the weeks before that years election It contained provisions allowing utilities and independent producers to compete in the wholesale power market that law has been credited with the current wave of deregulation in some markets So far states and the District of Columbia have either restructured their markets or enacted laws to begin retail competition in coming years Almanac p Mark Stultz a spokesman for the Electric Power Supply Association a group of competitive power suppliers and power marketers said the law was enacted after the electric industry quickly built up a consensus among members and educated them on what the bill would do The industry was able to access that in a very short time Stultz said As far as getting a restructuring bill through this year Stultz said it is not an impossible unrealizable goal to assume that we could get consensus since key stakeholders have reached agreement on several issues They include blocking market power the ability of a few companies to stunt competition by effectively using its assets to manipulate the deregulated market to its advantage While the House bill contains many issues stakeholders agree with Stultz said it also contains some fatal flaws He cited as an example its lack of federal agency jurisdiction over bundled services in a regulated market in which electric generation transmission and distribution rates are combined in an electric bill and unbundled services in a deregulated market in which the generation rates are broken apart from transmission and distribution rates and other temporary charges brought on by deregulation are included Best Bets in the Senate Of the eight bills pending in the Senate Nipper said the one with the best chance of passing is S sponsored by Slade Gorton RWash which is intended to encourage greater electric reliability Nipper said the Gorton bill would replace the North American Electric Reliability Council a group in which utility participation is voluntary with the Electric Reliability Organization a board that would require participation by utilities The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would have jurisdiction over the board as well as the power to enforce its policies on utilities The reliability issue is likely to intensify in coming months due to problems electric utilities faced each of the past two summers While some plants were undergoing needed maintenance some utilities were caught with their generation capacity down during periods of extremely high demand The resulting shortage triggered a spike in bulk electric prices driving the price of a megawatthour of electricity in a few places from to as high as Utilities enforced rotating blackouts on customers asked consumers to reduce electric use and passed on surcharges for the higher cost of electricity Hoping to avoid outages this summer the Department of Energy has scheduled four regional summits on electric reliability on April and Jim Owen a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute said a third consecutive summer of service interruptions and significant price increases could motivate Congress to move on the deregulation bill It might push this thing up further on the congressional radar screen although a law enacted immediately would not have a quick impact on generation and transmission reliability he said Other thorny issues include How to handle taxation issues between publicly owned utilities electric cooperatives and municipal utilities and whether utilities should voluntarily join or be forced to join regional transmission organizations designed to allow more efficient transfer of electricity across the national grid Whether the federal government should be involved in regulating the interstate transmission of electric power Some stakeholders argue federal regulation is necessary to prevent one state or region from protecting its customers at the expense of others Environmental groups desire for stronger antipollution restrictions on utilities that produce pollutants while generating electricity And labor groups wary that deregulation could trigger massive layoffs through corporate mergers and acquisitions want to make sure their union members are protected

Affairs group Thank you Congress continues to advance the Electricity Restructuring Legislative debate On Tuesday June th the Senate Energy Committee plans to markup and pass Senator Gortons Reliability bill including the consensus state savings clause language Attached below attachment jtstwpd is the page joint Senate staff draft which represents agreement in many areas but the differences remain significant No agreement was reachable at this time in Committee on the extent of FERC jurisdiction to prevent unreasonable differences between wholesale and retail service nor reached on the RPS Although the page draft includes language on PURPA Reciprocity Consumer Protection Interconnection etc currently only two Senators support the additional language included in the pages thus the only chance of moving through the Senate Energy Committee this year is to pass Reliabilityonly now With the makeup of the Senate Energy Committee our strategy is to do no harm in committee thus making the reliability languageonly option acceptable as a means to an end Enron does support the Reliability bill but we will insist on adding transmission access and functional separation language later in the process while EEI will insist on adding PUHCA while APPA will insist on adding Private Use thus we can see what the final consensus will look like plus we have been involved in drafting the consensus in all these provisionsbut timing and sequence are crucial It might be helpful to remind everyone that the bills leading up to the Energy Policy Act of as passed by the Committees were also amended in Conference since it was impossible to garner the necessary Committee votes or survive a Senate filibuster with any Committeeincluded wheeling language Transmission wheeling access language was successfully added in Conference Thus the sequence of adding our necessary provisions remains key to a successful strategy then as it does now Also attached is Chairman Blileys Reliability and Transmission discussion draft section by section summary and PDF This is the foundation from which he is willing to add additional consensus amendments From Enrons view this foundation draft is our exact wish list to clarify FERC jurisdiction over both bundled and unbundled transmission although we have suggested a few technical drafting points which have already been conveyed to staff It is important for all of us to convey our support for this draft as the essential foundation for the bill Markup will likely be scheduled to occur during the week of June th It is important to note that Subcommittee Chairman Barton is philosophically opposed to the BlileyEnron proFERC approach As such he has asked Texas PUC Chairman Pat Wood and Oklahoma Corporate Commission Chairwoman Denise Bode to draft a compromise to lighten the FERC authority in favor of a more Regional Approach I just got off the phone with Pat who walked me through the draft he was submitting this evening to Barton once it is officially transmitted I will be able to get a copy to you likely on Monday or Tuesday From Pats description we should be able to be supportive since he shares our views about wholesale markets needing federal authority He discussed a draft that mandates RTO participation a seven point mandatory RTO test filed at FERC in days after enactment Ratemaking established by the state but allowing FERC appeal allowing FERC appeal if rds disagree State authority but also ongoing FERC authority with an expedited dispute resolution process The seven point mandatory filing details are full wholesale competition under the same terms rates and conditions RTO sole functional control of transmission functional separation of generation from transmission curtailment on nondiscriminatory basis all transmission uses disclosed and transparent constant assessment of construction needs and remedy and emergency authority for dispute resolution He mentioned Denises insistence for interconnection on a nondiscriminatory basis which he feels is adequately addressed in their draft From Pats discussions with Reliant on his draft they again spoke in support of Enrons transmission open access goals TXU remains concerned that ERCOT will be pulled under FERC jurisdiction in the draft But it is Pats view that this already has happened under the state law Our goal next week is to lockin bipartisan House Committee support and House Leadership support for the markup plus tighten the markup process so it is transparent to all plus to pass the Senate Committee bill A bill to meet our established goals is still doable this year My strategy was always based upon the necessity to lead with the reliability language in order to create a legislative vehicle for us to include our nondiscriminatory transmission access provisions Please call should you need clarification or have questions Many thanks for your continued support sectionbysectionwpd summarydocwpd PDF

Navin PM To Cynthia NRON cc Subject CQ Weekly article on electricity restructuring Heres the electronic version of the electricity restructuring article that will appear in Mondays CQ Weekly in case you would like to forward there is a hard copy in your box CQ WEEKLY ENERGY Apr Page Pressure Surges to a New High To Legislate Electric Deregulation By James C Benton CQ Staff At the dawn of the year it seemed Congress would be content to let the current session end without moving legislation to encourage further deregulation of the nations billion electric market But developments in the past few weeks suggest that groups interested in seeing deregulation as well as the Clinton administration are building a consensus that will put pressure on Congress to move some kind of bill this year On April a group called the Electricity Restructuring Stakeholders representing consumers electric generating companies senior citizens and others released a set of goals they believe should be included in restructuring legislation The principles include repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of PUHCA and changes to a law PL that required state utility commissions and utilities to reform their electric rates and take other measures to even out daily electric consumption CQ Almanac p The group plans to meet with environmental groups and regulators to identify other areas where common ground can be reached said Joe Nipper chief lobbyist for the American Public Power Association A smaller trade group composed mainly of investorowned utilities is working on its own set of principles Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the stakeholder progress in an April speech to the National Energy Marketers Association and he urged Congress to pass an electric restructuring bill Our interstate electricity markets are in need of repair Richardson said adding that transmission access and generation capacity are decreasing as demand for electricity grows If Congress fails to act and act soon on restructuring legislation it will strangle the development of competitive electricity markets The two committee chairmen who will have to spearhead a restructuring plan have stated their intent to pass a bill by the end of the th Congress But they must navigate past obstacles that include the compressed calendar electionyear politics and a general lack of knowledge among their colleagues on how to rewrite or repeal PUHCA On April Senate Energy Chairman Frank H Murkowski RAlaska will hold the last of three hearings on eight electric deregulationrelated measures On the House side retiring Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J Bliley Jr RVa has vowed to work toward enacting a bill HR to encourage further state deregulation of the electric utility market That measure which would effectively allow consumers to buy their power from anyone not just the nearest utility was approved by the House Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Power on Oct CQ Weekly p CQ Weekly p The bill also would give states the authority to handle their transition to a competitive market but contains no deadline or date certain by which states would have to restructure Moving a Senate Bill Some are skeptical that the political and practical hurdles can be overcome this year For example while they have made progress on principles the key negotiators representing investorowned utilities electric cooperatives municipal electric utilities large electricity consumers labor unions and environmental groups still must reach consensus on details the legislation should address as well as the legislative language to implement any agreement I think the chances of getting a bill enacted this year are low not from the lack of trying Nipper said The best chance appears to lie in the Senate where Murkowskis committee is considering eight bills I am committed to getting something meaningful out of my committee Murkowski said in an April interview Murkowski acknowledged though that the congressional schedule and narrow consensus on each of the bills pose challenges to his goal developing a comprehensive deregulation bill not one that only addresses portions of electric restructuring The path in the House appears more difficult although one key supporter said there is behindthescenes movement Bliley has promised to hold a markup of HR before Memorial Day and he has named a task force of six members to help move the bill through committee Joe L Barton RTexas the sponsor of HR said meetings are taking place among Bliley Republican House staffers and some interested groups There is some action its just not visible Barton said late last month I think whats happening there is that stakeholders are jockeying for position Barton said he anticipated that a fairly good bill could be moved by the middle of May if stakeholders and members come together One complication Democrats in the midst of the battle to regain control of the House may not move toward a consensus with Republicans Staff aides for several Democratic members have already complained they have not heard from the committee staff in trying to work out differences raised in subcommittee But others point to a energy law PL that cleared Congress in the weeks before that years election It contained provisions allowing utilities and independent producers to compete in the wholesale power market that law has been credited with the current wave of deregulation in some markets So far states and the District of Columbia have either restructured their markets or enacted laws to begin retail competition in coming years Almanac p Mark Stultz a spokesman for the Electric Power Supply Association a group of competitive power suppliers and power marketers said the law was enacted after the electric industry quickly built up a consensus among members and educated them on what the bill would do The industry was able to access that in a very short time Stultz said As far as getting a restructuring bill through this year Stultz said it is not an impossible unrealizable goal to assume that we could get consensus since key stakeholders have reached agreement on several issues They include blocking market power the ability of a few companies to stunt competition by effectively using its assets to manipulate the deregulated market to its advantage While the House bill contains many issues stakeholders agree with Stultz said it also contains some fatal flaws He cited as an example its lack of federal agency jurisdiction over bundled services in a regulated market in which electric generation transmission and distribution rates are combined in an electric bill and unbundled services in a deregulated market in which the generation rates are broken apart from transmission and distribution rates and other temporary charges brought on by deregulation are included Best Bets in the Senate Of the eight bills pending in the Senate Nipper said the one with the best chance of passing is S sponsored by Slade Gorton RWash which is intended to encourage greater electric reliability Nipper said the Gorton bill would replace the North American Electric Reliability Council a group in which utility participation is voluntary with the Electric Reliability Organization a board that would require participation by utilities The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would have jurisdiction over the board as well as the power to enforce its policies on utilities The reliability issue is likely to intensify in coming months due to problems electric utilities faced each of the past two summers While some plants were undergoing needed maintenance some utilities were caught with their generation capacity down during periods of extremely high demand The resulting shortage triggered a spike in bulk electric prices driving the price of a megawatthour of electricity in a few places from to as high as Utilities enforced rotating blackouts on customers asked consumers to reduce electric use and passed on surcharges for the higher cost of electricity Hoping to avoid outages this summer the Department of Energy has scheduled four regional summits on electric reliability on April and Jim Owen a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute said a third consecutive summer of service interruptions and significant price increases could motivate Congress to move on the deregulation bill It might push this thing up further on the congressional radar screen although a law enacted immediately would not have a quick impact on generation and transmission reliability he said Other thorny issues include How to handle taxation issues between publicly owned utilities electric cooperatives and municipal utilities and whether utilities should voluntarily join or be forced to join regional transmission organizations designed to allow more efficient transfer of electricity across the national grid Whether the federal government should be involved in regulating the interstate transmission of electric power Some stakeholders argue federal regulation is necessary to prevent one state or region from protecting its customers at the expense of others Environmental groups desire for stronger antipollution restrictions on utilities that produce pollutants while generating electricity And labor groups wary that deregulation could trigger massive layoffs through corporate mergers and acquisitions want to make sure their union members are protected

Affairs group Thank you Congress continues to advance the Electricity Restructuring Legislative debate On Tuesday June th the Senate Energy Committee plans to markup and pass Senator Gortons Reliability bill including the consensus state savings clause language Attached below attachment jtstwpd is the page joint Senate staff draft which represents agreement in many areas but the differences remain significant No agreement was reachable at this time in Committee on the extent of FERC jurisdiction to prevent unreasonable differences between wholesale and retail service nor reached on the RPS Although the page draft includes language on PURPA Reciprocity Consumer Protection Interconnection etc currently only two Senators support the additional language included in the pages thus the only chance of moving through the Senate Energy Committee this year is to pass Reliabilityonly now With the makeup of the Senate Energy Committee our strategy is to do no harm in committee thus making the reliability languageonly option acceptable as a means to an end Enron does support the Reliability bill but we will insist on adding transmission access and functional separation language later in the process while EEI will insist on adding PUHCA while APPA will insist on adding Private Use thus we can see what the final consensus will look like plus we have been involved in drafting the consensus in all these provisionsbut timing and sequence are crucial It might be helpful to remind everyone that the bills leading up to the Energy Policy Act of as passed by the Committees were also amended in Conference since it was impossible to garner the necessary Committee votes or survive a Senate filibuster with any Committeeincluded wheeling language Transmission wheeling access language was successfully added in Conference Thus the sequence of adding our necessary provisions remains key to a successful strategy then as it does now Also attached is Chairman Blileys Reliability and Transmission discussion draft section by section summary and PDF This is the foundation from which he is willing to add additional consensus amendments From Enrons view this foundation draft is our exact wish list to clarify FERC jurisdiction over both bundled and unbundled transmission although we have suggested a few technical drafting points which have already been conveyed to staff It is important for all of us to convey our support for this draft as the essential foundation for the bill Markup will likely be scheduled to occur during the week of June th It is important to note that Subcommittee Chairman Barton is philosophically opposed to the BlileyEnron proFERC approach As such he has asked Texas PUC Chairman Pat Wood and Oklahoma Corporate Commission Chairwoman Denise Bode to draft a compromise to lighten the FERC authority in favor of a more Regional Approach I just got off the phone with Pat who walked me through the draft he was submitting this evening to Barton once it is officially transmitted I will be able to get a copy to you likely on Monday or Tuesday From Pats description we should be able to be supportive since he shares our views about wholesale markets needing federal authority He discussed a draft that mandates RTO participation a seven point mandatory RTO test filed at FERC in days after enactment Ratemaking established by the state but allowing FERC appeal allowing FERC appeal if rds disagree State authority but also ongoing FERC authority with an expedited dispute resolution process The seven point mandatory filing details are full wholesale competition under the same terms rates and conditions RTO sole functional control of transmission functional separation of generation from transmission curtailment on nondiscriminatory basis all transmission uses disclosed and transparent constant assessment of construction needs and remedy and emergency authority for dispute resolution He mentioned Denises insistence for interconnection on a nondiscriminatory basis which he feels is adequately addressed in their draft From Pats discussions with Reliant on his draft they again spoke in support of Enrons transmission open access goals TXU remains concerned that ERCOT will be pulled under FERC jurisdiction in the draft But it is Pats view that this already has happened under the state law Our goal next week is to lockin bipartisan House Committee support and House Leadership support for the markup plus tighten the markup process so it is transparent to all plus to pass the Senate Committee bill A bill to meet our established goals is still doable this year My strategy was always based upon the necessity to lead with the reliability language in order to create a legislative vehicle for us to include our nondiscriminatory transmission access provisions Please call should you need clarification or have questions Many thanks for your continued support sectionbysectionwpd summarydocwpd PDF

Affairs group Thank you Congress continues to advance the Electricity Restructuring Legislative debate On Tuesday June th the Senate Energy Committee plans to markup and pass Senator Gortons Reliability bill including the consensus state savings clause language Attached below attachment jtstwpd is the page joint Senate staff draft which represents agreement in many areas but the differences remain significant No agreement was reachable at this time in Committee on the extent of FERC jurisdiction to prevent unreasonable differences between wholesale and retail service nor reached on the RPS Although the page draft includes language on PURPA Reciprocity Consumer Protection Interconnection etc currently only two Senators support the additional language included in the pages thus the only chance of moving through the Senate Energy Committee this year is to pass Reliabilityonly now With the makeup of the Senate Energy Committee our strategy is to do no harm in committee thus making the reliability languageonly option acceptable as a means to an end Enron does support the Reliability bill but we will insist on adding transmission access and functional separation language later in the process while EEI will insist on adding PUHCA while APPA will insist on adding Private Use thus we can see what the final consensus will look like plus we have been involved in drafting the consensus in all these provisionsbut timing and sequence are crucial It might be helpful to remind everyone that the bills leading up to the Energy Policy Act of as passed by the Committees were also amended in Conference since it was impossible to garner the necessary Committee votes or survive a Senate filibuster with any Committeeincluded wheeling language Transmission wheeling access language was successfully added in Conference Thus the sequence of adding our necessary provisions remains key to a successful strategy then as it does now Also attached is Chairman Blileys Reliability and Transmission discussion draft section by section summary and PDF This is the foundation from which he is willing to add additional consensus amendments From Enrons view this foundation draft is our exact wish list to clarify FERC jurisdiction over both bundled and unbundled transmission although we have suggested a few technical drafting points which have already been conveyed to staff It is important for all of us to convey our support for this draft as the essential foundation for the bill Markup will likely be scheduled to occur during the week of June th It is important to note that Subcommittee Chairman Barton is philosophically opposed to the BlileyEnron proFERC approach As such he has asked Texas PUC Chairman Pat Wood and Oklahoma Corporate Commission Chairwoman Denise Bode to draft a compromise to lighten the FERC authority in favor of a more Regional Approach I just got off the phone with Pat who walked me through the draft he was submitting this evening to Barton once it is officially transmitted I will be able to get a copy to you likely on Monday or Tuesday From Pats description we should be able to be supportive since he shares our views about wholesale markets needing federal authority He discussed a draft that mandates RTO participation a seven point mandatory RTO test filed at FERC in days after enactment Ratemaking established by the state but allowing FERC appeal allowing FERC appeal if rds disagree State authority but also ongoing FERC authority with an expedited dispute resolution process The seven point mandatory filing details are full wholesale competition under the same terms rates and conditions RTO sole functional control of transmission functional separation of generation from transmission curtailment on nondiscriminatory basis all transmission uses disclosed and transparent constant assessment of construction needs and remedy and emergency authority for dispute resolution He mentioned Denises insistence for interconnection on a nondiscriminatory basis which he feels is adequately addressed in their draft From Pats discussions with Reliant on his draft they again spoke in support of Enrons transmission open access goals TXU remains concerned that ERCOT will be pulled under FERC jurisdiction in the draft But it is Pats view that this already has happened under the state law Our goal next week is to lockin bipartisan House Committee support and House Leadership support for the markup plus tighten the markup process so it is transparent to all plus to pass the Senate Committee bill A bill to meet our established goals is still doable this year My strategy was always based upon the necessity to lead with the reliability language in order to create a legislative vehicle for us to include our nondiscriminatory transmission access provisions Please call should you need clarification or have questions Many thanks for your continued support sectionbysectionwpd summarydocwpd PDF

Navin PM To Cynthia NRON cc Subject CQ Weekly article on electricity restructuring Heres the electronic version of the electricity restructuring article that will appear in Mondays CQ Weekly in case you would like to forward there is a hard copy in your box CQ WEEKLY ENERGY Apr Page Pressure Surges to a New High To Legislate Electric Deregulation By James C Benton CQ Staff At the dawn of the year it seemed Congress would be content to let the current session end without moving legislation to encourage further deregulation of the nations billion electric market But developments in the past few weeks suggest that groups interested in seeing deregulation as well as the Clinton administration are building a consensus that will put pressure on Congress to move some kind of bill this year On April a group called the Electricity Restructuring Stakeholders representing consumers electric generating companies senior citizens and others released a set of goals they believe should be included in restructuring legislation The principles include repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of PUHCA and changes to a law PL that required state utility commissions and utilities to reform their electric rates and take other measures to even out daily electric consumption CQ Almanac p The group plans to meet with environmental groups and regulators to identify other areas where common ground can be reached said Joe Nipper chief lobbyist for the American Public Power Association A smaller trade group composed mainly of investorowned utilities is working on its own set of principles Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the stakeholder progress in an April speech to the National Energy Marketers Association and he urged Congress to pass an electric restructuring bill Our interstate electricity markets are in need of repair Richardson said adding that transmission access and generation capacity are decreasing as demand for electricity grows If Congress fails to act and act soon on restructuring legislation it will strangle the development of competitive electricity markets The two committee chairmen who will have to spearhead a restructuring plan have stated their intent to pass a bill by the end of the th Congress But they must navigate past obstacles that include the compressed calendar electionyear politics and a general lack of knowledge among their colleagues on how to rewrite or repeal PUHCA On April Senate Energy Chairman Frank H Murkowski RAlaska will hold the last of three hearings on eight electric deregulationrelated measures On the House side retiring Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J Bliley Jr RVa has vowed to work toward enacting a bill HR to encourage further state deregulation of the electric utility market That measure which would effectively allow consumers to buy their power from anyone not just the nearest utility was approved by the House Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Power on Oct CQ Weekly p CQ Weekly p The bill also would give states the authority to handle their transition to a competitive market but contains no deadline or date certain by which states would have to restructure Moving a Senate Bill Some are skeptical that the political and practical hurdles can be overcome this year For example while they have made progress on principles the key negotiators representing investorowned utilities electric cooperatives municipal electric utilities large electricity consumers labor unions and environmental groups still must reach consensus on details the legislation should address as well as the legislative language to implement any agreement I think the chances of getting a bill enacted this year are low not from the lack of trying Nipper said The best chance appears to lie in the Senate where Murkowskis committee is considering eight bills I am committed to getting something meaningful out of my committee Murkowski said in an April interview Murkowski acknowledged though that the congressional schedule and narrow consensus on each of the bills pose challenges to his goal developing a comprehensive deregulation bill not one that only addresses portions of electric restructuring The path in the House appears more difficult although one key supporter said there is behindthescenes movement Bliley has promised to hold a markup of HR before Memorial Day and he has named a task force of six members to help move the bill through committee Joe L Barton RTexas the sponsor of HR said meetings are taking place among Bliley Republican House staffers and some interested groups There is some action its just not visible Barton said late last month I think whats happening there is that stakeholders are jockeying for position Barton said he anticipated that a fairly good bill could be moved by the middle of May if stakeholders and members come together One complication Democrats in the midst of the battle to regain control of the House may not move toward a consensus with Republicans Staff aides for several Democratic members have already complained they have not heard from the committee staff in trying to work out differences raised in subcommittee But others point to a energy law PL that cleared Congress in the weeks before that years election It contained provisions allowing utilities and independent producers to compete in the wholesale power market that law has been credited with the current wave of deregulation in some markets So far states and the District of Columbia have either restructured their markets or enacted laws to begin retail competition in coming years Almanac p Mark Stultz a spokesman for the Electric Power Supply Association a group of competitive power suppliers and power marketers said the law was enacted after the electric industry quickly built up a consensus among members and educated them on what the bill would do The industry was able to access that in a very short time Stultz said As far as getting a restructuring bill through this year Stultz said it is not an impossible unrealizable goal to assume that we could get consensus since key stakeholders have reached agreement on several issues They include blocking market power the ability of a few companies to stunt competition by effectively using its assets to manipulate the deregulated market to its advantage While the House bill contains many issues stakeholders agree with Stultz said it also contains some fatal flaws He cited as an example its lack of federal agency jurisdiction over bundled services in a regulated market in which electric generation transmission and distribution rates are combined in an electric bill and unbundled services in a deregulated market in which the generation rates are broken apart from transmission and distribution rates and other temporary charges brought on by deregulation are included Best Bets in the Senate Of the eight bills pending in the Senate Nipper said the one with the best chance of passing is S sponsored by Slade Gorton RWash which is intended to encourage greater electric reliability Nipper said the Gorton bill would replace the North American Electric Reliability Council a group in which utility participation is voluntary with the Electric Reliability Organization a board that would require participation by utilities The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would have jurisdiction over the board as well as the power to enforce its policies on utilities The reliability issue is likely to intensify in coming months due to problems electric utilities faced each of the past two summers While some plants were undergoing needed maintenance some utilities were caught with their generation capacity down during periods of extremely high demand The resulting shortage triggered a spike in bulk electric prices driving the price of a megawatthour of electricity in a few places from to as high as Utilities enforced rotating blackouts on customers asked consumers to reduce electric use and passed on surcharges for the higher cost of electricity Hoping to avoid outages this summer the Department of Energy has scheduled four regional summits on electric reliability on April and Jim Owen a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute said a third consecutive summer of service interruptions and significant price increases could motivate Congress to move on the deregulation bill It might push this thing up further on the congressional radar screen although a law enacted immediately would not have a quick impact on generation and transmission reliability he said Other thorny issues include How to handle taxation issues between publicly owned utilities electric cooperatives and municipal utilities and whether utilities should voluntarily join or be forced to join regional transmission organizations designed to allow more efficient transfer of electricity across the national grid Whether the federal government should be involved in regulating the interstate transmission of electric power Some stakeholders argue federal regulation is necessary to prevent one state or region from protecting its customers at the expense of others Environmental groups desire for stronger antipollution restrictions on utilities that produce pollutants while generating electricity And labor groups wary that deregulation could trigger massive layoffs through corporate mergers and acquisitions want to make sure their union members are protected

energy secretary ordering power generators to sell power to California With BCCAPower WoesGlance slasmt By STEVE LAWRENCE Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO AP US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday he would force power generators to sell electricity to California to prevent rolling blackouts The announcement came as California power regulators warned of the likelihood of a Stage Three power alert with rotating blackouts Wednesday afternoon due to trouble buying electricity from the Northwest About a dozen suppliers were demanding cash before selling power to California due to concerns about the utilities solvency said Kellan Fluckiger chief operating officer of the Independent System Operator keeper of the states electrical grid Californias two largest utilities Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison are near bankruptcy due to skyrocketing wholesale power costs Gov Gray Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said at a Washington DC news conference with Richardson Richardson said he was using emergency powers to force wholesalers to sell power to California at a price he deemed fair He said he would also request that two large Pacific Northwest power generating associations generate more power to send to California Davis and Feinstein also asked federal regulators to set a regional price cap on wholesale electricity to prevent the high prices that have plagued California On Friday the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission lifted price caps in California Record wholesale power prices followed and PGE warned it was in financial danger The credit limits of utilities and what markets are willing to sell us have been reached and surpassed in many cases Fluckiger said There are questions about utility solvency That has come to a head today He said officials may have to interrupt power to about a million customers Wednesday afternoon and then increase the blackouts to cover three million or four million in late afternoon and early evening when people come home from work and power demand hits a peak Steve Hansen a spokesman for Southern California Edison whose territory includes metropolitan Los Angeles but not the city said the utility had not ordered blackouts by early afternoon We have heard that it may not be as bad as we thought here he said Were waiting for some kind of official word from the ISO or somebody An unprecedented Stage Three emergency was issued last Thursday meaning reserves had fallen below percent In that case the state fended off the threat of rolling outages by turning off two powersucking water pumps on the Delta California is heavily importdependent and had been for years This is a Westwide problem Fluckiger said Blackouts if used would probably last about an hour to minutes and occur mostly in Northern California due to transmission limitations there Fluckiger said Its a fairly bleak picture he said adding that the chances of blackouts were better than This thing will not change unless something is done to alleviate the credit situation Contributing to the problem was a shortage of water to power hydroelectric generators in the Northwest and California Fluckiger said We have reservoirs so low that we have people standing by them watching the situation to make sure it does not go below safe limits he said Gasfired generators could be brought on line to ease the situation but natural gas prices are so high they would not cover the operating costs Fluckiger said Requests have been made to operate those facilities and then have the utilities pay for those excess gas costs Fluckiger said The utilities have not been able to do so They have requested permission from the PUC to be able to pass those costs through to customers Utilities would decide who would face blackouts he said They try to avoid areas with essential services such as hospitals Fluckiger said Californias power market has been hit for months by tight supplies and price spikes Electricity deregulation cold weather and rising power costs have been blamed for the states most recent problems California approved a phasedin deregulation of the electricity market in to try to lower prices for consumers through competition but so far it has led to higher energy prices The Northwest heavily dependent on hydroelectric power has faced low water tables and had to import electricity from California and other states And wholesale power costs have been soaring due in large part to skyrocketing prices for natural gas Wall Street is worried about utilities economic health and on Tuesday a consumer group urged the state to seize and run the strapped billion electricity system A Stage One alert was declared Wednesday morning meaning power reserves were below percent and all power users are asked to conserve Stage One and Stage Two emergencies in which power reserves fall below percent have become routine this month but last Thursdays Stage Three was the only time the threat of blackouts loomed EDITORS NOTE Associated Press writer Bart Jansen in Washington contributed to this report APWS EST
