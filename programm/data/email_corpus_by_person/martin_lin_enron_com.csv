<4062347.1075840751130.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,martin.lin@enron.com,2002-01-25 13:14:25,RE Reference request regarding Eric W Cope SRpst Vince Please find below some text for Erics letter I hope it is helpful for your development of the letter If you have questions or would like some other information please let me know Also on the question of Enron letterhead I suppose the desired form of submission is via the web site Unless you have electronic letterhead the issue may be moot Martin Eric Cope worked as a summer associate in the Research Group during the summer of During this time Eric worked on a variety of projects requiring a diverse set of skills In all cases he quickly grasped the scope and context of the problems at hand While some direction was given in each case Eric was often charged with developing the approach details independently and he executed the tasks very effectively One major project for the summer was to develop a webbrowserbased trading simulation platform TSP The TSP would create user accounts require user logons post simulated market information post simulated commidity prices accept and execute buy and sell transactions for users and track user account information such as positions order history and buying power The TSP would allow for the use of human users as well as software agent Simulated commidity prices could be histroical prices ficticious calculated prices or bidoffer prices based on some update algorithms The primary goal was to create a framework to test different udpate algorithms and trading strategies Eric immediately arranged for the appropriate reference materials to develop the database and associated software infrastructure In short order a simple site was up for users to create accounts and begin trading commodities The project ended before extensive algorithm evaluation could begin however the TSP goes a long way to making such evaluations possible Other projects included the development of forecast models for motion picture box office revenues advertising media placement prices and longdistance voice telephony prices In many of the cases data were scarce as were definitive instructions Eric analyzed the problem to develop a focused approach always in consultation and discussion with others but never with handholding or intense oversight His coworkers and immediate supervisor quickly developed confidence in Erics ability to take general direction and achieve productive results Such confidence and ability is crucial in an environment with limited structure such as we had Original

EST MessageId From ATT Web Resume Database To Subject Reference request regarding Eric W Cope SR XMailer Unknown No Version ContentType textplain charsetUSASCII Dear Colleague Eric W Cope has submitted an application to ATT Labs with a request that we seek a reference letter from you in support of this application We thank you in advance for providing this letter The reference letters are a very important part of our evaluation process but we also recognize that they call for a significant measure of time and attention on your part In this message we first describe below the three options for submittal of the letter and then in the final paragraphs you will find some comments about the nature of the job applied for We know your time is precious so we have tried to make the process as efficient as possible If you have access to a browser from your mailer then the easiest thing is to use the URL given below kblcgibinresumedocsSR Via this web page you can submit text html postscript or pdf files Please note that this URL should be used ONLY by you and ONLY for this particular student It is linked directly to the students resume and the processing occurs automatically and immediately If it is inconvenient to use the URL you may email your letter by replying to this email but please help us out if you use this option by sending the letter as plain text only not as a word processor file without indent and not as an attachment Also please make sure that your mailer includes the entire subject line in your reply message If you use this option please note that the processing of your letter will occur manually and therefore may entail a considerable delay Our system will format the emailed text appropriately for display unless you ask that it be treated as fixedformat As a third option if you prefer you may submit your letter as hard copy Please note that we discourage this approach since electronic letters can be distributed far more effectively to the hiring managers However if you wish please see academicAddresseshtml for information on the proper address to use for various purposes Finally a word about the position for which the student has applied This student has applied for a summer internship We hire summer interns roughly from the third year of undergraduate work through graduate school The summer projects vary in level depending on the student involved The students normally work in a oneonone fashion with a member of staff on some facet of the ongoing research work in the lab but they are expected to function somewhat independently after an initial period of familiarization with the work Accordingly we are interested in information you may have as to the students adaptability ability to learn new material and to work effectively with minimal supervision Thank you in advance for your cooperation Ken Lyons ATT Labs Web Resume Database
