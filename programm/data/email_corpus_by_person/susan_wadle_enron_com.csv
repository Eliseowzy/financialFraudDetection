Friday Original Message From Gadd Eric Sent Monday March PM To Matthews Ron Cc Hyatt Kevin Wadle Susan Asante Ben Subject FW Sun Devil Cost Sheet Ron Thanks for the note Several commentsquestions It is not necessary to plan facilities for MMcfd and MMcfd to meet the hour day load At the moment we can only identify MMcfd potential demand for hour day load Can we avoid a fully looped line and still serve the MMcfd demand for hour day load If so would there be additional capacity that we could sell to other markets based on hour loads in the Phoenix area Ill be out of town on Tues Wed returning on Thurs Lets get together and agree the base case for project scope Ill ask Susan Wadle to coordinate a meeting with you Kevin Ben and myself Eric Original Message From Matthews Ron Sent Monday March PM To Gadd Eric Cc Asante Ben Eisenstein Arnold L Gadd Eric Hyatt Kevin Smith Mike L Rosenberg David E Subject RE Sun Devil Cost Sheet No Because of the problems that occurred with the swing loads we had to go back to the fully looped line Running steady state wasnt a problem but trying to meet peaks was with the miles Since Planning has been guessing at what the customer wants in the way of swing capability TW needs to nail that part down so Planning can run a GOOD analysis We can barely meet the hour day load at MMcfd average day condition but can not at the hour day at MMcfd scenario even with fully looped pipe We Planning can run a multitude of cases that may or may not work and still may not hit the one the customer needs Lets get together to discuss again to make sure everyone is on the same page Bits and pieces from separate groups can cause problems with the true scope of work I would suggest you Kevin Ben and myself to establish a project scope to be carried out from this day
