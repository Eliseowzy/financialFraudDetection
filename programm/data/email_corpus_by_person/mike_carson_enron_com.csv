wave of panicembarrassment This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding If you release an escapee do not acknowledge it Pretend it did not happen If you are standing next to the farter at the urinal pretend that you did not hearit No one likes an escapee it is uncomfortable for all involved Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy JAILBREAK Used in conjunction with escapee Definition When forcing poop several farts slip out at a machine guns pace This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover If this should happen do not panic remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred COURTESY FLUSH Definition The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME WALK OF SHAME Definition Walking from the stall to the sink to the door after you have just stunkup the bathroom This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you As with all farts it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist Can be avoided with the use of a COURTESY FLUSH OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER Definition A colleague who poops at work

the whereabouts of OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS SAFE HAVEN Definition A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom TURD BURGLAR Definition A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work If this occurs remain in the stall until the TURD BURGLAR leaves This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact CAMOCOUGH Definition A phony cough which alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall This can be used to coverup a WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE ASTAIRE Definition A subtle toetap that is used to alert potential TURD BURGLARS that you are occupying a stall This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied If you hear an ASTAIRE leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace WATERMELON Definition A turd that creates a loud splash when
