TreoTM communicator During the next few weeks well bring you behindthescenes looks at its development stories from the Treo design team a sneak peak at some features and a whole lot more To learn more about Treo communicator go to adckcktreo The Road to Integration The concept isnt new If you carry around a mobile phone and an organizer youve probably wished someone would figure out how to combine them both into one small device Now imagine if you also had to carry around a pager or a messaging device Do this for a while and youll understand the benefit of putting all three into one package But successfully combining these devices involves much more than simply fitting them all into a single unit Sure you might get a good phone but probably at the expense of a decent organizer Thats because the individual needs of these devices are in constant conflict with each other A good mobile phone needs to be small but organizers and web browsers need to have reasonablysized screens to get the job done And a numeric keypad is great for dialing numbers but challenging for text entry No Room for Compromise These were some of the challenges the Treo design team faced when they started creating this product The team wanted a device that looked and felt comfortable as a phone but also worked perfectly as an organizer and wireless data device Other products that have existed in the past have been compromises explains Jeff Hawkins cofounder of Handspring and inventor of the PalmPilotR Youve had to trade off some of the main features to get the combined device Our goal with Treo was to find a nocompromise solution Powerful Possibilities The team began to consider everything that was possible in a combined phone and organizer that could not be achieved with standalone devices And what they found was often times surprisingly powerful The result is a device that actually improves upon each of its individual components through a variety of unique features The thing about Treo Hawkins says is that its small enough to be a phone and yet its improved upon the phone and its improved upon the organizer and its added wireless data capabilities that no phone or organizer has ever had And by combining them all together you basically have a smaller product that does more than either one does separately In the weeks to come well show you some of the unique features that resulted from this successful integration along with the thinking that went into them Youll get an indepth look at what happens when you take a phone an organizer and a messengeradd wireless Internet capabilitiesand successfully combine them into one powerful device that does it all Coming next week Why youll never have to dial a phone number again Tips Tricks You already know that To Do lets you
