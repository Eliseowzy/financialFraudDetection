bottom So suggest you read my note to Blaine first Regards Les Forwarded by Les WebberENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Yamagata Blaine KINGUMPCOM on AM To cc Subject RE AKIN GUMP Draft Enron Stripping MemoDOC Les With regard to the conclusions you have drawn from my memo I have the following initial thoughts While SLNG might have a difficult time demonstrating that the Btucf standard is necessary for the safe and efficient operation of the system the allocation of the burden of proof would not require that SLNG prove its position The level currently is in SLNGs tariff and I believe would be presumed by the FERC to be the level that is necessary for the safe and efficient operation of its system If Enron wished to challenge the number now it most likely would have to do so pursuant to a Section complaint proceeding initiated by Enron Assuming that the Commission agreed that the matter should be docketed and subject to further proceedings Enron would bear the burden of proof for demonstrating that the level is not just and reasonable Further while Gene would need to be consulted challenging the Btu level arguably might be construed as a breach of the October agreements While I obviously agree that there is no specific ceiling on the Btu content for gas in the tariff of Southern Natural Gas it is likely that both the pipeline and its downstream customers both direct and indirect would raise the merchantability issue I agree that the gas treating and conditioning examples do not include removal of liquids and that the examples support the extraction of liquids as a processing function rather than treatment or conditioning Relying on those specific examples however is not without risk Specifically the status of facilities will be decided on the basis of a primary function test which looks at all of the facts and circumstances It is because of that uncertainty that I am unable to provide Enron with a definitive statement that facilities used to strip liquids would be treated as nonjurisdictional I do think however we would have the better side of the argument if we can show that there is an real economic benefit to be gained from removing the liquids and separately selling them The Commission recognizes that a single facility may be providing multiple services and if we can demonstrate that the primary purpose is to sell the liquids for a profit I believe we can qualify the plant as a processing facility Moreover I think that SLNG and its downstream customers would be hardpressed to object to the facility being treated as a nonjurisdictional facility First if built by Enron andor others none of the costs would be included in SLNGs cost of service Second downstream customers will get the benefit of additional gas supplies and would not lose any gas since the plant operator as a matter of contract will likely be required to return thermally equivalent volumes which are discussed in the memo Third SLNG gets what it wants because it keeps downstream customers happy while also enabling the terminal to accept LNG from sources other than Trinidad Finally if SLNG were to build the liquids extraction plant as a conditioning or treating plant and include the costs in its cost of service it may also be required to credit back to those customers the profits from the sale of liquids Conversely if SLNG builds the plant as a processing plant shippers could by contract retain title to the higher Btus and pay SLNG a processing fee Depending on the level of the processing fee and the liquids market that might not be economically attractive to SLNG or a processing affiliate On the matter of a seat at the table I now better understand what you desire That concept however needs further thought by me since I have no ready recommendation about how to achieve that goal through the regulatory process Original Message From mailto Sent Sunday February PM To KINGUMPCOM Cc Subject Re AKIN GUMP Draft Enron Stripping MemoDOC BLAINE I have read your draft memo and I have the following comments off the top of my head First after you read my email from earlier today you will see that the seat at the table concept is focused on El Paso Merchant Energy providing us with Customer status in dealing with Southern LNG in whatever manner and to whatever extent would be reasonably consistent therewith This would be intended to give us the best possible standing with the FERC It would not limit our rights to those set forth in the Quality Letter Agreement It would allow us to address a number of solutions to the quality issue at Elba and give us rights to involve the FERC if Southern LNG attempted to behave in an unduly discriminatory manner etc In summary this a general concept as opposed to one looking specifically at the stripping alternative Second I think your draft memo does actually address the issue of jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional facilities although I would like to see a conclusion or two Let me tell you mine Southern LNG would have a difficult time ever proving that LNG receipts above the Btu per cf spec at the Elba Island LNG Terminal represents a safety operational or efficiency concern within the Terminal even though admittedly it is outside their specs The other US LNG Terminals are proof of the opposite Southern LNG would have a difficult time proving the same for the downstream Southern Natural Gas pipeline system particularly since the vaporized LNG is not outside the specs of that system The gas conditioning and treating examples never seem to include gas liquids removal per se Treating talks about removal of acid gases and water not gas liquids Conditioning would appear to encompass the removal of gas liquids to the extent required in achieving hydrocarbon dew point control Any LNG we would import would pass that standard It could be argued that the addition of air or nitrogen would be open to arguments on both sides of the jurisdiction issue although it involves an addition not a removal Since it does not impact safety operations or efficiency the facilities could be nonjurisdictional However you would have to have all the downstream customers on board or the customers along with Southern LNG would force the FERC to take jurisdiction by some mechanism On the other hand the gas liquids stripping alternative would most likely achieve nonjurisdictional treatment There are economics involved with the gas liquids the downstream customers would be supportive and one could argue that it is discretionary in terms of the LNG ie it would not be intended to strip all LNG The next step would appear to be to conference with Nancy and agree upon the path forward in your analysis Regards Les The information contained in

the following actions in regard to this information I would like to schedule a meeting with you and one or both of Todd Peterson and Tony Galt as soon as conveniently possible Monday February to discuss these and related issues I will ask Kathleen to schedule the meeting I would like you to take the lead in following up on a number of matters with Southern LNG SLNG and El Paso Merchant Energy EPME I think you should do this verbally with followup written confirmation Please ensure that we direct all correspondence to the proper corporate entities For example FERC compliance matters should be addressed to El Paso Merchant Energy with a copy to Southern LNG Correspondence directed to Southern LNG would have to deal with matters related to the Quality Letter Agreement or be in answering requests they direct to us I would like you to keep both Eric Groves and Rod Hayslett up to date on all cost related matters so that the cost of service model being developed by Rod Hayslett and being incorporated into Eric Groves economics model is as accurate as possible When Rod transfers his COS model to Eric we should be able to reduce our communications with Rod to an asrequired basis You have made some excellent points in your note and I believe we need to follow up on several of them ie spare parts we have used the information supplied by Southern LNG with the exception of the stripping facilities I think you are right I think we should include your estimates in the COS model However I would not raise this with EPMESLNG we can discuss it at the time of the TrueUp filing by SLNG O M costs in April SLNG did add to their fixed OM costs but not their variable ones I think the information supplied by SLNG in late does pick up increased OM costs in the fixed portion of the COS and increased power costs I believe they have deliberately held the variable OM costs at the same level as in April by putting the increase in fixed OM I think you should formalize a request to EPME copy to SLNG around dredging maintenance costs broken out by category ie berth channel proposed new turning basin old turning basin etc I cannot find the figure in your fifth point I have never tried to estimate maintenance dredging costs Your sixth point is one I had not even thought about and you are right I forgot about the tug pilots I would like you to raise this issue with EPME copy to SLNG If the pilots are on board hours per day days per year to escort to vessels past the dock each day then I believe your cost estimate is too low We definitely need to include the EPME liquids stripping model economics in the COS model as one key alternative to handle high Btu content LNG Therefore we need to ensure we obtain an asaccurateaspossible assessment of all the costs The model will have the capability to handle several alternatives in this regard I would also like to discuss the following matters at the Monday meeting status of the British Gas marine study in general status of our initial views on Phase I of the British Gas marine study plans to deal with early release of study results to SLNG understanding of the marine consultants conclusions around the twotugescort possibility eg where would the tugs be located Would they tie onto the vessels other ramifications of the escort proposal liability risk insurance owners reaction FERCimposedrequirement versus USCG USCG preliminary report Enron initiatives with the USCG tug owners pilots etc everywhere on the ship side of the unloading flange and other as may be brought forward Until Monday Les James McMillan AM To Les WebberENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Re ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL Cost of Service Les I have the following comments on your attached Cost of Service Model Assume that AFUDC is essentially Interest during Construction at a rate of Suspect that Stabilization Air or N Cost provided by Southern LNG on April does not include spare parts which would increase parts by about ie This system would also increase OM Costs Fixed Cost assume no increase in staff Variable OM Swag for Maintenance Cost Electric Power by per year hp operating of time Question to SLNG does their hr Variable OM include maintenance dredging of the Dock Turning Basin August same comment on spare parts as item above increase Spares by times incremental capital cost yr for Air and for N injection FERC Environmental SWAGs for Capital Cost look OK Assume your Fixed OM Cost is for Maintenance Dredging camera maintenance will be negligible Spare parts would only apply to camera surveillance which is negligible Stand by Tugs cost does not include standby tug pilots Add another SWAG per year for them Stripping Alternative shouldnt we be using El Paso Energys latest proposal here ie the MM proposal Scaled up to MM for contingency owners cost and interest during construction plus another to for export facilities with another MMhr for OM Regards James Les Webber PM To Rod NRON Eric CT Lisa nron James McMillanENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL Cost of Service Greetings I am attaching my Excel spreadsheet that takes you through the various iterations of the capital expenses and costofservice calculations for the Elba Island LNG Terminal I have included certain estimate information that reflects my attempt to derive costofservice information to augment what Southern LNG has provided Rod Hayslett has kindly agreed to develop the proper algorithm to more accurately calculate this information and to work with Eric Groves on integrating this as a module in Erics LNG economic evaluation model for the Atlantic Basin I believe we will need this in order to analyze the proposals that we expect to receive from El Paso Merchant Energy this week I would also like James McMillan to take a look at the commodity charges and electric power rates for the nitrogen injection air injection and gas liquids stripping cases as well as at the fixed OM costs Some updating of the estimate information is likely needed I will send copies of the relevant background information received from Southern LNG to each of you In addition I will be sending out a general
