One beneficia ry of the anthrax scare has been Bayer AG BAYZY OTC BB ADR news com mentary research analysis the German chemical maker which has seen its share price gain since the terrorist attacks But investors bidding up the stock might be getting ahead of themselves Bayer makes Cipro a leading treatment for anthrax But while the demand for Cipro is high sales from the drug are only a small portion of the companys overal l revenue which totaled billion euros last year and according to a nalysts will increase even more this year due to its acquisition of Aven tis CropScience a crop protection and production company To put the dema nd for Cipro in context JP Morgan expects US sales of the drug to be approximately billion euros for IMAGE IMAGEborderD hei ghtD widthD IMAGE Even emergency purchases of Cipro pr obably wont add that much to Bayers overall revenues The president has asked for million for antibiotics to combat bioterrorist attacks Whi le its possible that sum will be increased not all the money would be sp ent on Cipro Besides its not even clear that Bayer will remain the on ly producer of Cipro Though the company holds the patent for the drug th eres some pressure in Congress for the government to purchase a generic v ersion from other manufacturers On another front Bayer is currently b attling a classaction lawsuit related to an anticholesterol drug implica ted in a number of deaths It was forced to withdraw the drug from the mar ket Bayer may offer protection against anthrax but that doesnt mean i ts a refuge for investors Losses at Twice the

the purchase of Aspect Development in M arch To be fair investors in companies that have made big acquisi tions like i typically focus on pro forma earnings which exclude charges and extraordinary

Microsoft MSFT Nasdaq news commentary research a nalysis is in the hot seat for its sharklike behavior toward a competito r It stands accused of sending fake cereal boxes emblazoned with the words Microsoft Server Crunch to customers of rival server software maker Novell The boxes according to Novell contained a number of false and misleading statements intended as putdowns of Novell products Amo ng the attempted insults were some notsoclever plays on packaged food F or example in a reference to Novells flagship software product a line o n the Microsoft boxes read Whats the expiration date on that NetWare pla tform A round of applause please for those gutsplittingly funny engi neers The boxes also said Novell is shifting its focus from software t o consulting services which Novell says isnt true Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the cereal boxes were primarily intended to advertise Mic rosoft services not to slight Novell It was all in the theme of a mock cereal box he said It was a modest campaign In response to Novell s complaints he says Microsoft sent out a letter in September to recipie nts of the boxes to clarify some of its statements and its just agreed t o send another letter to appease the company For the record Novell said its not calling off its lawsuit for unspecified money damages AMD s Feisty Pledge CEOs dont get their jobs by being eloquent and it probab ly
