developing a briefing paper for the ASEAN Trade Ministers who will be attending the World Trade Organization Ministerials in Seattle WA later this year Trade representatives from Brunei Malaysia Indonesia Singapore the Philippines and Thailand are expected to attend To ensure that member concerns are addressed in the paper please send commentssuggestions regarding the below draft to me at by cob Friday November I will circulate a final draft the week of November Thank you USASEAN Business Council Briefing Paper PRIORITY BUSINESS ISSUES prepared in advance of the WTO Ministerials November A group of of Americas leading companies the USASEAN Business Council prides itself as being dedicated to effectively strengthen bilateral and USASEAN relations through strong economic and commercial ties The Council is committed to promoting open and free trade globally with the belief that such an environment is of benefit to all Open and transparent markets translate into economic growth and the opportunity to raise the standards of living of the worlds people In addition to providing a larger range of goods and services rulesbased open markets allow countries to be more competitive in the international arena In this spirit the Councils members offer this briefing paper as a compilation of the commercial issues we consider of highest priority at the onset of the new round of the WTO negotiations This is not a comprehensive roster rather attention has been given to issues which Hold priority status for American businesses seeking to expand their trade and investment ties in ASEAN and Have been advanced significantly through the APEC process and have a realistic prospect of being concluded within the three year timeframe PRIORITY ISSUES Accelerated Tariff Liberalization The agreement reached at the recent APEC Leaders Meeting in Auckland has provided the critical mass necessary for action on accelerated tariff liberalization in eight priority sectors within the framework of the WTO Continued tariff reduction will have wealth creating and efficiency enhancing effects on global trade The end result would be a larger international market that will encourage the continued foreign investment and global capital flows Agriculture A robust global food system that efficiently links food production food processing and consumption is vital to continuing development worldwide Council members support initiatives to remove all export subsidies and to reduce tariffs on agricultural products The Council also supports activities to ensure marketaccess for agricultural products enhanced with the use of biotechnology Use of this technology provides a safe and sufficient food supply while ensuring the safety of food sources and environment through strong and transparent sciencebased domestic regulatory systems Customs issues The Council is encouraged by the positive progress being made in the area of Customs reform and liberalization In the context of this ongoing cooperation members hope to see the adoption of the International Express Carriers Conference IECC Guidelines for Customs and encourage governments to continue to address electronic preclearance in a paperless environment twentyfour hour customs operation elimination of export clearance procedures higher deminimus levels transshipment without processing and payment of duties and taxes for imports at defined periods rather than upon arrival Each of these actions would improve the speed or lower the expense of shipment Countries that have adopted measures along the lines of the above have reduced the bottleneck effect that Customs can create and have improved the competitive environment for companies within their borders This attracts investment which creates jobs and wealth Ecommerce In the past few years electric or ECommerce has expanded the depth and breadth of global commerce Although the physical infrastructure is quickly spreading to support such transactions the legal and regulatory framework is still being developed Both suppliers and consumers of Ecommerce will benefit from an improved legal environment and measures to benchmark policies and best practices in member economies To ensure that the industry continues to develop the WTO should give special priority to adopting a permanent moratorium on the imposition of duties on electronic commerce Energy With growing demand for energy and calls for clean and efficient use of resources the WTO should look to promote the diversification of energy supply and a marketdriven energy infrastructure development Wellfunctioning markets greater energy efficiency and information flows among market participants will aid in sustainable and equitable growth globally The WTO should support initiatives like the APEC Natural Gas Initiative signed by the Energy Ministers at Okinawa last year and the ongoing policy dialogues to address energy serviceoriented issues related to the development extraction production distribution marketing consumption of all energy products ITA The US private sector applauds the advances made under the International Technology Agreement ITA and looks forward to the beginning of negotiations for the second phase of the agreement While the November ITA II package does not meet all of our expectations the Councils members are confident agreements resulting from the successful passage of ITA II will increase product coverage encourage progress on the elimination of nontariff measures and lead to the harmonization of tariff classification of products already covered in previous negotiation rounds The continued review and revision of the ITAs product coverage will further expand and distribute the benefits of information technology globally and is a fundamental necessity for such a fastpaced dynamic industry Although the Council would encourage discussion of ITAII during the upcoming round of WTO negotiations we believe that the ITAII negotiations should remain independent and should be concluded as soon as possible

demonstrators are out in force this morning and we plan to stay as far away from them as possible Joe Hillings Forwarded by Lora SullivanCorpEnron on AM From Chris Long PM To Lora NRON cc Subject WTO Notes INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE WTO The World Trade Organization WTO Ministerial meeting began yesterday in Seattle well almost An event scheduled for Monday was delayed for f our hours because of a breach of security The official opening will not occur until today but the behind the scenes meetings and negotiations beg an Monday November th and will continue until December rd In reality the re are two events going on One is a circus media event taking place in the streets of Seattle and the second is the serious trade negotiations going o n between the trade ministers of countries There are many important people appearing this week to include President Clinton Even Fiedel Castr o has been invited to speak at the University of Washington which is located less than a mile from the WTO activities The circus events in the street are designed to sever the communications between world trade officials and the rest of the world While it has its comic side its basic aim is anything but funny If the true story of trad e cannot be told the only view that the world gets of the WTO is that it is an event not to be taken seriously The street events are sort of like the shell on an egg They prevent you from seeing the egg itself but the shell is not the substance of the egg In an attempt to make certain the media events in the street do not succee d as far as Halliburton is concerned I will attempt to give you a fair and balanced account of what is really going on for the next four days This i s truly an interesting ministerial round of negotiations in that even Seattle cant seem to get a grip on what they stand for They bid on and won th e right to host the WTO this year and it will mean millions in income for the city There are signs along the streets welcoming the WTO At the same time the city of Seattle and the country it is located in are heavily pro union and they are sponsoring a huge antiWTO rally They have gra nted permits for antiWTO parades on busy streets during rush hours which makes many downtown workers less than happy These workers then vent their frustration against the WTO for causing the streets to be blocked Life in Seattle can best be described as schizophrenic INSIDE THE WTO Here is the inside Story From November th to December rd mos t of the worlds trade representatives are meeting in Seattle in private Meetin gs will not be in the open for fear of disruption Demonstrators then use thi s fact to say the talks are secrete because they are really all about world dominance The truth is that the trade ministers will be reviewing the global trading system and attempting to insure its dynamism and responsiveness in the years to come Talks actually began in Geneva earlie r this year but the formal meetings to reach agreement will be this week For years the WTO formally known as the GATT for General Agre ement on Tariffs and Trade has attempted to open world trade markets and set predictable and stable rules for trade During this year period there has been an fold growth in international trade This was a reversal of what is now widely recognized as disastrous policies of the s when increased trade barriers discrimination among trading partners and an absence of agreed rules helped fuel the Great Depression The beginning of this ministerial round finds some important issues to be resolved in order to eliminate barriers that currently inhibit trade The largest barrier is agriculture because European and Japanese farmers are heavily subsidized so that they can compete with the United States The United States Trade Representative USTR office listed seven other issues of concern to be discussed and agree upon during the negotiations Most important to Halliburton is the issue of services Our company performs energy services all over the world but the WTO has never looked at trade barriers in the energy services area The USTR representative present at t he kickoff meeting on Monday morning was asked if energy services were being discussed in this round and she assured us that it would be a significant part of the new negotiations The USTR is hopeful that this week will end with agreements between all parties as to the issues to be resolved over th e next three years and they are confident of success OUTSIDE THE WTO A small band of demonstrators most dressed like skeletons animals and turtles took to the streets on Sunday November th for a preview of thing s to come They demonstrated in front of the GAP clothing store downtown A number of the demonstrators were seen to be wearing GAP jeans and jackets under their skeleton suits They were demonstrating against GAPs use of slave labor Street interviews indicated that no one was to articu late about where these slaves were The crowd of about was well organized if uninformed and moved to an abandon warehouse where they broke into the building in order to occupy it Police did not attempt to eject them they simply cut of the power and water to this old concrete damp and cold building In addition homeless people through out Seattle were moved duri ng the weekend for the duration of the WTO in order to allow demonstrators the opportunity to occupy their places on the streets It seems many of the demonstrators had neglected to make reservations elsewhere Rain is expect ed Tuesday and Wednesday which should add to the demonstrators woes Seattle morning news carried a very level broadcast listing the environmental and labor demands of the demonstrators and also relating the fact that billion in trade is done by Washington each year milli on in grain alone was sold to Japan during Somewhere in excess of o f Washingtons economy is based on foreign trade and they are now the thir d largest trading state behind California and Texas This all adds to the schizophrenia that is beginning to be known as Seattle 
<8888006.1075846144480.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lora.sullivan@enron.com,1999-12-03 01:57:00,Report from WTO Part IV Cc Halliburton Subject Report from WTO Part IV INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE WTO INSIDE Renato Ruggiero former Director General of the World Trade Organization WTO spoke at a dinner for members of the Coalition for Service Industries on Wednesday evening His remarks were some of the best made during the WTO Seattle Round but were off the record and will probably not appear in print Among his observations were billion people residing in countries are trying to get into the WTO at this time The WTO is regarded by many as the organization needed to deal with the globalization in which all nations now find themselves Labor and environmental issues already have forums in which to have their issues heard Their problem is that nothing works as well as the WTO That they want to move their issues into the WTO area is not only understandable it is flattering Concerning the demonstrations As long as reason rules over emotions in this world the WTO will prevail The demonstrators goals may be right I dont know But their aim is wrong The WTO should not be their target The demonstrators have had the effect of making ministers even more determined to finish their work The Seattle Round has had an interesting ancillary result Environmental groups previously in disagreement or acting independently have taken the occasion of the WTO meeting to unify Greenpeace The Sierra Club Friends of the Earth The National Wildlife Federation and The World Wildlife Fund have been meeting before and during the Seattle Round Their goal is to put a sharp focus on what they want from the WTO As of this writing it is not clear if they wish to put the WTO out of business or get their issues made part of the negotiations but the latter is more likely What ever they decide the coalition of these environmentalists will be much more likely to be heard in the future Prior to the Presidents arrival agriculture and other difficult issues were making significant headway towards resolving differences The President arrived in Seattle on Wednesday amongst hopes that his visit would have a positive effect on negotiations but the opposite occurred His ability to communicate was put to good use as he spoke to all facets of the WTO to include the demonstrators and until he granted an interview with the Financial Times the best possible face was being put on WTO negotiations The Times article was published on Thursday however and it upset everyone In the interview President Clinton stated that core standards on labor should be adopted by the WTO and included in all trade agreements If they were not followed they should be enforced with sanctions Until these remarks the administration had maintained that only a working group on labor should be established with the mission of analyzing links between trade and labor The idea of a working group was gaining steam until the interview was published The United States Trade Representative was rumored to be very upset and the Presidents remarks met with almost universal condemnation Delegates from Japan and the European Union made strong statements of disagreement as did most of the developing nations Many see the use of sanctions as the antithesis of the WTOs mission There was speculation that the remarks were made to assist Vice President Gore with labor in his bid for the White House and that the President did not really believe they would have any effect within the WTO They did and the effect was all negative President Clinton made the rounds of a number of parties that evening to include one hosted for the members of congress who had worked on the African Trade bill At one time prior to the Presidents arrival there were members of Congress on the stage with Representative Charles Rangel DNY and it was the broadest possible array of political beliefs Individuals representing the most liberal side of the Democrat party stood side by side with individuals from the most conservative side of the Republican party all waiting for the President When he didnt appear the congressional representatives left the stage and mingled with about guests It was a lobbyists dream For minutes they talked joked and lobbied while they waited for the President He arrived made a predictable speech and left the stage only to find that for security reasons he would have to remain in the room awhile longer It turned out to be one of the most festive events of the week OUTSIDE people were arrested as of Thursday morning Delegates from many countries were surprised that the arrests were so long in coming and expressed significant displeasure with the turmoil in the streets Third world countries have been the most critical Their concerns focus on improving their economies They need infrastructure and financing before they can worry about the plight of sea turtles in oceans that dont even boarder their countries Many of them do not disagree with Americas basic goals but they believe that rich countries ideals are standing in the way of third world countries progress As days of disturbance continue the humor of the demonstrations is diminishing What is left are hard core anarchists bent simply on destruction The positive side of all this is that the goodness of people in Seattle is now beginning to show itself King Country Councilman Brian Derdowski took to the streets Tuesday evening surveying the damage and trying to mollify the crowds He saw a man grab a sack of coffee at a vandalized Starbucks and he approached him Derdowski told the wouldbe looter he really shouldnt take the bag of beans and the man dropped the bag hugged the Councilman and then walked away from the riots Nancy Woodland and her husband both Seattle attorneys saw the violence on television on Tuesday By Wednesday afternoon they were in the heart of town with Windex Comet SOS and elbow grease They spent most of the day cleaning the storefronts of other peoples businesses Terry Webb who owns a greeting card store has seen his business drop by When interviewed by a local newspaper he simply smiled and reached for one of his cards He handed the reporter a card that read Tough times are like speed bumps They only slow you down for a little This will be my last report from Seattle Don DAVE GRIBBIN Vice President

Hillings The notes look great I have made a couple of technical corrections to the document which I am attaching as a separate file To all everyone here at Hills company hopes you have a wonderful holiday Bob Fisher Hills Company Dear Friends Please review correct make additions and return Joe The Energy Services Coalition please note that we are no longer using US WTO ESC met at the request of Carol Balassa of USTR to get her perspective on energy services negotiations of the WTO and what our coalition needs to accomplish as well as a time perspective Present from the USG were Carol Balassa USTR Josephine Ludolph and Richard Boll DOC Russ Profozich DOE Patricia Norman DOS and a regular from the ITC Joe Hillings Christina Bolton Bob Fisher Steve Burns Brian Petty and Chris Long represented the ESC Carol conducted an extensive and excellent briefing listing several phases of activity She started the session by telling those present that the lack of action at Seattle was not a negative on what we need to accomplish this coming year We are on track and need to produce various position papers as early as the end of January Articles of the GATT requires that the WTO make progress on agriculture and services issues although it does not identify a date certain to achieve agreement Ambassador Barshefsky is committed to beginning services negotiations beginning in January A Committee on Specific Committments is charged with the responsibility to draft issues The USTR wants to have a definition of issues from the ESC by the end of January to be submitted to the USG representatives on the Committee A second significant group in the process is the Working Group On Domestic RightsThis group is chaired by Peter Collins Peter needs to know what are the domestic regulatory issues that could be raised by other WTO members as reasons not to liberalize various sectors This information is to be supplied in the first half of In late spring after group one and two have done a significant part of their work the USTR will be deciding what additional principles are needed to be tabled in the negotiation They expect these working groups will begin to meet at the WTO by the end of next summer Three basic columns headed by Market Access National Treatment Additional Committments Could be proposed annex such as the process Tim Richards has proposed in our Electricity Working Group listing examples is the format to be developed for the two groups Carol advised us that whatever we develop should be with the intention of getting Less Developed Countries LDCs supporting our basic principles in case a multilateral negotiation is not launched We should work the current liberalization process being prosecuted in the APEC and FTAA negotiations The next phase of Carols presentation addressed the recent response USTR received to the questions they submitted to DG it no longer exisits under the new commission asking the EU to address their feelings about the liberalization of energy services We have not been given a copy of the EU response and Carol has asked Ms Klinkers of the EU if the response can be shared with the ESC to secure industry responce Carol and others from the USG attending the meeting are trying to ascertain just who drafted the responses which they characterized as confusing and not indicating a real understanding of the current practices and developments in the energy services sector We do know that the USG has called this office to ask how they need to respond to the EU response that electricity is a good and not a service Our immediate response is that this is a matter of some disagreement among EU members and the EU staff The movement of electricity across national boundries may be a good but the sale and trading of electricity is definately a service The EU response we were told makes the agrument that in their view that many of the items raised in the October paper of the USTR were GAT covered such as construction engineering etc and therefore may not need to be raised in the services negotiations although these items will at least need some sort of annex to make sure they are included The EU believes that if you own or operate electricity producting then its a good but if you operate an IPP to sell electricity to various parties its a service We were told that the EU response does not seem to understand or cover renewables such as wind and solar both of which are important in Europes plan to diversify and develop green energy They also believe that pricerisk management should be considered under finance services not energy services The session was then open to general discussion Bob Fisher commented that the EU does not seem to understand the scope of todays energy services industry That we now have a seemless web of energy services that has been developed What about environmental services Again the EU response is confusted and incomplete Apparently they feel that environmental services can be considered elsewhere in the negotiation Who from the EU drafted this paper The staff has changed and we dont know how high in their heirarchy this was considered Carol Balassa responded that she is trying to determine who drafted the response Brian Petty advised that his intelligence is that energy services is being discussed and considered at the highest levels of the Commission Carol told us that she is trying to get everything together before talking to the EU in January when she hopes to specifically respond and discuss their current returned response Therefore she is asking the Energy Services Coalition to complete the work of our four Working Groups which will allow the Hills people to develop the definition and basic negotiating position papers The DOS representative then suggested that we engage in somecapacity building This was defined as an outreach program to brief WTO member delegations on the meaning of energy services Carol suggested that after her January meeting the EU could be agreeable to having our industry group meet with their representatives to explain how energy services has evolved and what is included in energy services We moved to a discussion of the definitions paper itself Bob Fisher reminded those present that the current matrix developed for the APEC process was still an excellent guide to definitions although items such as renewables heating and certain trading and financial services would need to be added To meet some EU concerns that they are not a party to APEC and therefore suspicious of any such document we should remove the reference to APEC Our group pointed to the Tim Richards paper developed for our Electricity Working Group which gives a broad definition but then contains a footnote known as the illustrative list which lists the various items that we believe constitute energy services under that heading Bob Fisher said that this was the likely format we would ultimately adopt in the material prepared for USTR and others in the WTO process Bob said that once negotiators agree on the need for liberalized energy services they can fit whatever they want under the broad definition The last question raised was what happens to the ATL accelerated tariff liberalization which also covers some energy matters which WTO countries had contemplated being approved in Seattle Carol said that she did not know The meeting then adjourned The ESC needs to complete the Working Group process and complete the questionaire at the earliest possible time to allow the Hills people to prepare the basic document Working Group chairs are to be asked to complete this process by mid January Dear Reviewers Please review at your earliest opportunity make corrections additions and whatever and return to me for distribution Distribution will be to our ESC Executive Committee first and then to our entire membership of not to those who have not signed on as members and to USG participants

Hillings The notes look great I have made a couple of technical corrections to the document which I am attaching as a separate file To all everyone here at Hills company hopes you have a wonderful holiday Bob Fisher Hills Company Dear Friends Please review correct make additions and return Joe The Energy Services Coalition please note that we are no longer using US WTO ESC met at the request of Carol Balassa of USTR to get her perspective on energy services negotiations of the WTO and what our coalition needs to accomplish as well as a time perspective Present from the USG were Carol Balassa USTR Josephine Ludolph and Richard Boll DOC Russ Profozich DOE Patricia Norman DOS and a regular from the ITC Joe Hillings Christina Bolton Bob Fisher Steve Burns Brian Petty and Chris Long represented the ESC Carol conducted an extensive and excellent briefing listing several phases of activity She started the session by telling those present that the lack of action at Seattle was not a negative on what we need to accomplish this coming year We are on track and need to produce various position papers as early as the end of January Articles of the GATT requires that the WTO make progress on agriculture and services issues although it does not identify a date certain to achieve agreement Ambassador Barshefsky is committed to beginning services negotiations beginning in January A Committee on Specific Committments is charged with the responsibility to draft issues The USTR wants to have a definition of issues from the ESC by the end of January to be submitted to the USG representatives on the Committee A second significant group in the process is the Working Group On Domestic RightsThis group is chaired by Peter Collins Peter needs to know what are the domestic regulatory issues that could be raised by other WTO members as reasons not to liberalize various sectors This information is to be supplied in the first half of In late spring after group one and two have done a significant part of their work the USTR will be deciding what additional principles are needed to be tabled in the negotiation They expect these working groups will begin to meet at the WTO by the end of next summer Three basic columns headed by Market Access National Treatment Additional Committments Could be proposed annex such as the process Tim Richards has proposed in our Electricity Working Group listing examples is the format to be developed for the two groups Carol advised us that whatever we develop should be with the intention of getting Less Developed Countries LDCs supporting our basic principles in case a multilateral negotiation is not launched We should work the current liberalization process being prosecuted in the APEC and FTAA negotiations The next phase of Carols presentation addressed the recent response USTR received to the questions they submitted to DG it no longer exisits under the new commission asking the EU to address their feelings about the liberalization of energy services We have not been given a copy of the EU response and Carol has asked Ms Klinkers of the EU if the response can be shared with the ESC to secure industry responce Carol and others from the USG attending the meeting are trying to ascertain just who drafted the responses which they characterized as confusing and not indicating a real understanding of the current practices and developments in the energy services sector We do know that the USG has called this office to ask how they need to respond to the EU response that electricity is a good and not a service Our immediate response is that this is a matter of some disagreement among EU members and the EU staff The movement of electricity across national boundries may be a good but the sale and trading of electricity is definately a service The EU response we were told makes the agrument that in their view that many of the items raised in the October paper of the USTR were GAT covered such as construction engineering etc and therefore may not need to be raised in the services negotiations although these items will at least need some sort of annex to make sure they are included The EU believes that if you own or operate electricity producting then its a good but if you operate an IPP to sell electricity to various parties its a service We were told that the EU response does not seem to understand or cover renewables such as wind and solar both of which are important in Europes plan to diversify and develop green energy They also believe that pricerisk management should be considered under finance services not energy services The session was then open to general discussion Bob Fisher commented that the EU does not seem to understand the scope of todays energy services industry That we now have a seemless web of energy services that has been developed What about environmental services Again the EU response is confusted and incomplete Apparently they feel that environmental services can be considered elsewhere in the negotiation Who from the EU drafted this paper The staff has changed and we dont know how high in their heirarchy this was considered Carol Balassa responded that she is trying to determine who drafted the response Brian Petty advised that his intelligence is that energy services is being discussed and considered at the highest levels of the Commission Carol told us that she is trying to get everything together before talking to the EU in January when she hopes to specifically respond and discuss their current returned response Therefore she is asking the Energy Services Coalition to complete the work of our four Working Groups which will allow the Hills people to develop the definition and basic negotiating position papers The DOS representative then suggested that we engage in somecapacity building This was defined as an outreach program to brief WTO member delegations on the meaning of energy services Carol suggested that after her January meeting the EU could be agreeable to having our industry group meet with their representatives to explain how energy services has evolved and what is included in energy services We moved to a discussion of the definitions paper itself Bob Fisher reminded those present that the current matrix developed for the APEC process was still an excellent guide to definitions although items such as renewables heating and certain trading and financial services would need to be added To meet some EU concerns that they are not a party to APEC and therefore suspicious of any such document we should remove the reference to APEC Our group pointed to the Tim Richards paper developed for our Electricity Working Group which gives a broad definition but then contains a footnote known as the illustrative list which lists the various items that we believe constitute energy services under that heading Bob Fisher said that this was the likely format we would ultimately adopt in the material prepared for USTR and others in the WTO process Bob said that once negotiators agree on the need for liberalized energy services they can fit whatever they want under the broad definition The last question raised was what happens to the ATL accelerated tariff liberalization which also covers some energy matters which WTO countries had contemplated being approved in Seattle Carol said that she did not know The meeting then adjourned The ESC needs to complete the Working Group process and complete the questionaire at the earliest possible time to allow the Hills people to prepare the basic document Working Group chairs are to be asked to complete this process by mid January Dear Reviewers Please review at your earliest opportunity make corrections additions and whatever and return to me for distribution Distribution will be to our ESC Executive Committee first and then to our entire membership of not to those who have not signed on as members and to USG participants

Ruggiero former Director General of the World Trade Organization WTO spoke at a dinner for members of the Coalition for Service Industries on Wednesday evening His remarks were some of the best made during the WTO Seattle Round but were off the record and will probably not appear in print Among his observations were billion people residing in countries are trying to get into the WTO at this time The WTO is regarded by many as the organization needed to deal with the globalization in which all nations now find themselves Labor and environmental issues already have forums in which to have their issues heard Their problem is that nothing works as well as the WTO That they want to move their issues into the WTO area is not only understandable it is flattering Concerning the demonstrations As long as reason rules over emotions in this world the WTO will prevail The demonstrators goals may be right I dont know But their aim is wrong The WTO should not be their target The demonstrators have had the effect of making ministers even more determined to finish their work The Seattle Round has had an interesting ancillary result Environmental groups previously in disagreement or acting independently have taken the occasion of the WTO meeting to unify Greenpeace The Sierra Club Friends of the Earth The National Wildlife Federation and The World Wildlife Fund have been meeting before and during the Seattle Round Their goal is to put a sharp focus on what they want from the WTO As of this writing it is not clear if they wish to put the WTO out of business or get their issues made part of the negotiations but the latter is more likely What ever they decide the coalition of these environmentalists will be much more likely to be heard in the future Prior to the Presidents arrival agriculture and other difficult issues were making significant headway towards resolving differences The President arrived in Seattle on Wednesday amongst hopes that his visit would have a positive effect on negotiations but the opposite occurred His ability to communicate was put to good use as he spoke to all facets of the WTO to include the demonstrators and until he granted an interview with the Financial Times the best possible face was being put on WTO negotiations The Times article was published on Thursday however and it upset everyone In the interview President Clinton stated that core standards on labor should be adopted by the WTO and included in all trade agreements If they were not followed they should be enforced with sanctions Until these remarks the administration had maintained that only a working group on labor should be established with the mission of analyzing links between trade and labor The idea of a working group was gaining steam until the interview was published The United States Trade Representative was rumored to be very upset and the Presidents remarks met with almost universal condemnation Delegates from Japan and the European Union made strong statements of disagreement as did most of the developing nations Many see the use of sanctions as the antithesis of the WTOs mission There was speculation that the remarks were made to assist Vice President Gore with labor in his bid for the White House and that the President did not really believe they would have any effect within the WTO They did and the effect was all negative President Clinton made the rounds of a number of parties that evening to include one hosted for the members of congress who had worked on the African Trade bill At one time prior to the Presidents arrival there were members of Congress on the stage with Representative Charles Rangel DNY and it was the broadest possible array of political beliefs Individuals representing the most liberal side of the Democrat party stood side by side with individuals from the most conservative side of the Republican party all waiting for the President When he didnt appear the congressional representatives left the stage and mingled with about guests It was a lobbyists dream For minutes they talked joked and lobbied while they waited for the President He arrived made a predictable speech and left the stage only to find that for security reasons he would have to remain in the room awhile longer It turned out to be one of the most festive events of the week OUTSIDE people were arrested as of Thursday morning Delegates from many countries were surprised that the arrests were so long in coming and expressed significant displeasure with the turmoil in the streets Third world countries have been the most critical Their concerns focus on improving their economies They need infrastructure and financing before they can worry about the plight of sea turtles in oceans that dont even boarder their countries Many of them do not disagree with Americas basic goals but they believe that rich countries ideals are standing in the way of third world countries progress As days of disturbance continue the humor of the demonstrations is diminishing What is left are hard core anarchists bent simply on destruction The positive side of all this is that the goodness of people in Seattle is now beginning to show itself King Country Councilman Brian Derdowski took to the streets Tuesday evening surveying the damage and trying to mollify the crowds He saw a man grab a sack of coffee at a vandalized Starbucks and he approached him Derdowski told the wouldbe looter he really shouldnt take the bag of beans and the man dropped the bag hugged the Councilman and then walked away from the riots Nancy Woodland and her husband both Seattle attorneys saw the violence on television on Tuesday By Wednesday afternoon they were in the heart of town with Windex Comet SOS and elbow grease They spent most of the day cleaning the storefronts of other peoples businesses Terry Webb who owns a greeting card store has seen his business drop by When interviewed by a local newspaper he simply smiled and reached for one of his cards He handed the reporter a card that read Tough times are like speed bumps They only slow you down for a little This will be my last report from Seattle Don DAVE GRIBBIN Vice President

demonstrators are out in force this morning and we plan to stay as far away from them as possible Joe Hillings Forwarded by Lora SullivanCorpEnron on AM From Chris Long PM To Lora NRON cc Subject WTO Notes INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE WTO The World Trade Organization WTO Ministerial meeting began yesterday in Seattle well almost An event scheduled for Monday was delayed for f our hours because of a breach of security The official opening will not occur until today but the behind the scenes meetings and negotiations beg an Monday November th and will continue until December rd In reality the re are two events going on One is a circus media event taking place in the streets of Seattle and the second is the serious trade negotiations going o n between the trade ministers of countries There are many important people appearing this week to include President Clinton Even Fiedel Castr o has been invited to speak at the University of Washington which is located less than a mile from the WTO activities The circus events in the street are designed to sever the communications between world trade officials and the rest of the world While it has its comic side its basic aim is anything but funny If the true story of trad e cannot be told the only view that the world gets of the WTO is that it is an event not to be taken seriously The street events are sort of like the shell on an egg They prevent you from seeing the egg itself but the shell is not the substance of the egg In an attempt to make certain the media events in the street do not succee d as far as Halliburton is concerned I will attempt to give you a fair and balanced account of what is really going on for the next four days This i s truly an interesting ministerial round of negotiations in that even Seattle cant seem to get a grip on what they stand for They bid on and won th e right to host the WTO this year and it will mean millions in income for the city There are signs along the streets welcoming the WTO At the same time the city of Seattle and the country it is located in are heavily pro union and they are sponsoring a huge antiWTO rally They have gra nted permits for antiWTO parades on busy streets during rush hours which makes many downtown workers less than happy These workers then vent their frustration against the WTO for causing the streets to be blocked Life in Seattle can best be described as schizophrenic INSIDE THE WTO Here is the inside Story From November th to December rd mos t of the worlds trade representatives are meeting in Seattle in private Meetin gs will not be in the open for fear of disruption Demonstrators then use thi s fact to say the talks are secrete because they are really all about world dominance The truth is that the trade ministers will be reviewing the global trading system and attempting to insure its dynamism and responsiveness in the years to come Talks actually began in Geneva earlie r this year but the formal meetings to reach agreement will be this week For years the WTO formally known as the GATT for General Agre ement on Tariffs and Trade has attempted to open world trade markets and set predictable and stable rules for trade During this year period there has been an fold growth in international trade This was a reversal of what is now widely recognized as disastrous policies of the s when increased trade barriers discrimination among trading partners and an absence of agreed rules helped fuel the Great Depression The beginning of this ministerial round finds some important issues to be resolved in order to eliminate barriers that currently inhibit trade The largest barrier is agriculture because European and Japanese farmers are heavily subsidized so that they can compete with the United States The United States Trade Representative USTR office listed seven other issues of concern to be discussed and agree upon during the negotiations Most important to Halliburton is the issue of services Our company performs energy services all over the world but the WTO has never looked at trade barriers in the energy services area The USTR representative present at t he kickoff meeting on Monday morning was asked if energy services were being discussed in this round and she assured us that it would be a significant part of the new negotiations The USTR is hopeful that this week will end with agreements between all parties as to the issues to be resolved over th e next three years and they are confident of success OUTSIDE THE WTO A small band of demonstrators most dressed like skeletons animals and turtles took to the streets on Sunday November th for a preview of thing s to come They demonstrated in front of the GAP clothing store downtown A number of the demonstrators were seen to be wearing GAP jeans and jackets under their skeleton suits They were demonstrating against GAPs use of slave labor Street interviews indicated that no one was to articu late about where these slaves were The crowd of about was well organized if uninformed and moved to an abandon warehouse where they broke into the building in order to occupy it Police did not attempt to eject them they simply cut of the power and water to this old concrete damp and cold building In addition homeless people through out Seattle were moved duri ng the weekend for the duration of the WTO in order to allow demonstrators the opportunity to occupy their places on the streets It seems many of the demonstrators had neglected to make reservations elsewhere Rain is expect ed Tuesday and Wednesday which should add to the demonstrators woes Seattle morning news carried a very level broadcast listing the environmental and labor demands of the demonstrators and also relating the fact that billion in trade is done by Washington each year milli on in grain alone was sold to Japan during Somewhere in excess of o f Washingtons economy is based on foreign trade and they are now the thir d largest trading state behind California and Texas This all adds to the schizophrenia that is beginning to be known as Seattle

Indonesia Singapore the Philippines and Thailand are expected to attend To ensure that member concerns are addressed in the paper please send commentssuggestions regarding the below draft to me at by cob Friday November I will circulate a final draft the week of November Thank you USASEAN Business Council Briefing Paper PRIORITY BUSINESS ISSUES prepared in advance of the WTO Ministerials November A group of of Americas leading companies the USASEAN Business Council prides itself as being dedicated to effectively strengthen bilateral and USASEAN relations through strong economic and commercial ties The Council is committed to promoting open and free trade globally with the belief that such an environment is of benefit to all Open and transparent markets translate into economic growth and the opportunity to raise the standards of living of the worlds people In addition to providing a larger range of goods and services rulesbased open markets allow countries to be more competitive in the international arena In this spirit the Councils members offer this briefing paper as a compilation of the commercial issues we consider of highest priority at the onset of the new round of the WTO negotiations This is not a comprehensive roster rather attention has been given to issues which Hold priority status for American businesses seeking to expand their trade and investment ties in ASEAN and Have been advanced significantly through the APEC process and have a realistic prospect of being concluded within the three year timeframe PRIORITY ISSUES Accelerated Tariff Liberalization The agreement reached at the recent APEC Leaders Meeting in Auckland has provided the critical mass necessary for action on accelerated tariff liberalization in eight priority sectors within the framework of the WTO Continued tariff reduction will have wealth creating and efficiency enhancing effects on global trade The end result would be a larger international market that will encourage the continued foreign investment and global capital flows Agriculture A robust global food system that efficiently links food production food processing and consumption is vital to continuing development worldwide Council members support initiatives to remove all export subsidies and to reduce tariffs on agricultural products The Council also supports activities to ensure marketaccess for agricultural products enhanced with the use of biotechnology Use of this technology provides a safe and sufficient food supply while ensuring the safety of food sources and environment through strong and transparent sciencebased domestic regulatory systems Customs issues The Council is encouraged by the positive progress being made in the area of Customs reform and liberalization In the context of this ongoing cooperation members hope to see the adoption of the International Express Carriers Conference IECC Guidelines for Customs and encourage governments to continue to address electronic preclearance in a paperless environment twentyfour hour customs operation elimination of export clearance procedures higher deminimus levels transshipment without processing and payment of duties and taxes for imports at defined periods rather than upon arrival Each of these actions would improve the speed or lower the expense of shipment Countries that have adopted measures along the lines of the above have reduced the bottleneck effect that Customs can create and have improved the competitive environment for companies within their borders This attracts investment which creates jobs and wealth Ecommerce In the past few years electric or ECommerce has expanded the depth and breadth of global commerce Although the physical infrastructure is quickly spreading to support such transactions the legal and regulatory framework is still being developed Both suppliers and consumers of Ecommerce will benefit from an improved legal environment and measures to benchmark policies and best practices in member economies To ensure that the industry continues to develop the WTO should give special priority to adopting a permanent moratorium on the imposition of duties on electronic commerce Energy With growing demand for energy and calls for clean and efficient use of resources the WTO should look to promote the diversification of energy supply and a marketdriven energy infrastructure development Wellfunctioning markets greater energy efficiency and information flows among market participants will aid in sustainable and equitable growth globally The WTO should support initiatives like the APEC Natural Gas Initiative signed by the Energy Ministers at Okinawa last year and the ongoing policy dialogues to address energy serviceoriented issues related to the development extraction production distribution marketing consumption of all energy products ITA The US private sector applauds the advances made under the International Technology Agreement ITA and looks forward to the beginning of negotiations for the second phase of the agreement While the November ITA II package does not meet all of our expectations the Councils members are confident agreements resulting from the successful passage of ITA II will increase product coverage encourage progress on the elimination of nontariff measures and lead to the harmonization of tariff classification of products already covered in previous negotiation rounds The continued review and revision of the ITAs product coverage will further expand and distribute the benefits of information technology globally and is a fundamental necessity for such a fastpaced dynamic industry Although the Council would encourage discussion of ITAII during the upcoming round of WTO negotiations we believe that the ITAII negotiations should remain independent and should be concluded as soon as possible

developing a briefing paper for the ASEAN Trade Ministers who will be attending the World Trade Organization Ministerials in Seattle WA later this year Trade representatives from Brunei Malaysia Indonesia Singapore the Philippines and Thailand are expected to attend To ensure that member concerns are addressed in the paper please send commentssuggestions regarding the below draft to me at by cob Friday November I will circulate a final draft the week of November Thank you USASEAN Business Council Briefing Paper PRIORITY BUSINESS ISSUES prepared in advance of the WTO Ministerials November A group of of Americas leading companies the USASEAN Business Council prides itself as being dedicated to effectively strengthen bilateral and USASEAN relations through strong economic and commercial ties The Council is committed to promoting open and free trade globally with the belief that such an environment is of benefit to all Open and transparent markets translate into economic growth and the opportunity to raise the standards of living of the worlds people In addition to providing a larger range of goods and services rulesbased open markets allow countries to be more competitive in the international arena In this spirit the Councils members offer this briefing paper as a compilation of the commercial issues we consider of highest priority at the onset of the new round of the WTO negotiations This is not a comprehensive roster rather attention has been given to issues which Hold priority status for American businesses seeking to expand their trade and investment ties in ASEAN and Have been advanced significantly through the APEC process and have a realistic prospect of being concluded within the three year timeframe PRIORITY ISSUES Accelerated Tariff Liberalization The agreement reached at the recent APEC Leaders Meeting in Auckland has provided the critical mass necessary for action on accelerated tariff liberalization in eight priority sectors within the framework of the WTO Continued tariff reduction will have wealth creating and efficiency enhancing effects on global trade The end result would be a larger international market that will encourage the continued foreign investment and global capital flows Agriculture A robust global food system that efficiently links food production food processing and consumption is vital to continuing development worldwide Council members support initiatives to remove all export subsidies and to reduce tariffs on agricultural products The Council also supports activities to ensure marketaccess for agricultural products enhanced with the use of biotechnology Use of this technology provides a safe and sufficient food supply while ensuring the safety of food sources and environment through strong and transparent sciencebased domestic regulatory systems Customs issues The Council is encouraged by the positive progress being made in the area of Customs reform and liberalization In the context of this ongoing cooperation members hope to see the adoption of the International Express Carriers Conference IECC Guidelines for Customs and encourage governments to continue to address electronic preclearance in a paperless environment twentyfour hour customs operation elimination of export clearance procedures higher deminimus levels transshipment without processing and payment of duties and taxes for imports at defined periods rather than upon arrival Each of these actions would improve the speed or lower the expense of shipment Countries that have adopted measures along the lines of the above have reduced the bottleneck effect that Customs can create and have improved the competitive environment for companies within their borders This attracts investment which creates jobs and wealth Ecommerce In the past few years electric or ECommerce has expanded the depth and breadth of global commerce Although the physical infrastructure is quickly spreading to support such transactions the legal and regulatory framework is still being developed Both suppliers and consumers of Ecommerce will benefit from an improved legal environment and measures to benchmark policies and best practices in member economies To ensure that the industry continues to develop the WTO should give special priority to adopting a permanent moratorium on the imposition of duties on electronic commerce Energy With growing demand for energy and calls for clean and efficient use of resources the WTO should look to promote the diversification of energy supply and a marketdriven energy infrastructure development Wellfunctioning markets greater energy efficiency and information flows among market participants will aid in sustainable and equitable growth globally The WTO should support initiatives like the APEC Natural Gas Initiative signed by the Energy Ministers at Okinawa last year and the ongoing policy dialogues to address energy serviceoriented issues related to the development extraction production distribution marketing consumption of all energy products ITA The US private sector applauds the advances made under the International Technology Agreement ITA and looks forward to the beginning of negotiations for the second phase of the agreement While the November ITA II package does not meet all of our expectations the Councils members are confident agreements resulting from the successful passage of ITA II will increase product coverage encourage progress on the elimination of nontariff measures and lead to the harmonization of tariff classification of products already covered in previous negotiation rounds The continued review and revision of the ITAs product coverage will further expand and distribute the benefits of information technology globally and is a fundamental necessity for such a fastpaced dynamic industry Although the Council would encourage discussion of ITAII during the upcoming round of WTO negotiations we believe that the ITAII negotiations should remain independent and should be concluded as soon as possible

Hillings The notes look great I have made a couple of technical corrections to the document which I am attaching as a separate file To all everyone here at Hills company hopes you have a wonderful holiday Bob Fisher Hills Company Dear Friends Please review correct make additions and return Joe The Energy Services Coalition please note that we are no longer using US WTO ESC met at the request of Carol Balassa of USTR to get her perspective on energy services negotiations of the WTO and what our coalition needs to accomplish as well as a time perspective Present from the USG were Carol Balassa USTR Josephine Ludolph and Richard Boll DOC Russ Profozich DOE Patricia Norman DOS and a regular from the ITC Joe Hillings Christina Bolton Bob Fisher Steve Burns Brian Petty and Chris Long represented the ESC Carol conducted an extensive and excellent briefing listing several phases of activity She started the session by telling those present that the lack of action at Seattle was not a negative on what we need to accomplish this coming year We are on track and need to produce various position papers as early as the end of January Articles of the GATT requires that the WTO make progress on agriculture and services issues although it does not identify a date certain to achieve agreement Ambassador Barshefsky is committed to beginning services negotiations beginning in January A Committee on Specific Committments is charged with the responsibility to draft issues The USTR wants to have a definition of issues from the ESC by the end of January to be submitted to the USG representatives on the Committee A second significant group in the process is the Working Group On Domestic RightsThis group is chaired by Peter Collins Peter needs to know what are the domestic regulatory issues that could be raised by other WTO members as reasons not to liberalize various sectors This information is to be supplied in the first half of In late spring after group one and two have done a significant part of their work the USTR will be deciding what additional principles are needed to be tabled in the negotiation They expect these working groups will begin to meet at the WTO by the end of next summer Three basic columns headed by Market Access National Treatment Additional Committments Could be proposed annex such as the process Tim Richards has proposed in our Electricity Working Group listing examples is the format to be developed for the two groups Carol advised us that whatever we develop should be with the intention of getting Less Developed Countries LDCs supporting our basic principles in case a multilateral negotiation is not launched We should work the current liberalization process being prosecuted in the APEC and FTAA negotiations The next phase of Carols presentation addressed the recent response USTR received to the questions they submitted to DG it no longer exisits under the new commission asking the EU to address their feelings about the liberalization of energy services We have not been given a copy of the EU response and Carol has asked Ms Klinkers of the EU if the response can be shared with the ESC to secure industry responce Carol and others from the USG attending the meeting are trying to ascertain just who drafted the responses which they characterized as confusing and not indicating a real understanding of the current practices and developments in the energy services sector We do know that the USG has called this office to ask how they need to respond to the EU response that electricity is a good and not a service Our immediate response is that this is a matter of some disagreement among EU members and the EU staff The movement of electricity across national boundries may be a good but the sale and trading of electricity is definately a service The EU response we were told makes the agrument that in their view that many of the items raised in the October paper of the USTR were GAT covered such as construction engineering etc and therefore may not need to be raised in the services negotiations although these items will at least need some sort of annex to make sure they are included The EU believes that if you own or operate electricity producting then its a good but if you operate an IPP to sell electricity to various parties its a service We were told that the EU response does not seem to understand or cover renewables such as wind and solar both of which are important in Europes plan to diversify and develop green energy They also believe that pricerisk management should be considered under finance services not energy services The session was then open to general discussion Bob Fisher commented that the EU does not seem to understand the scope of todays energy services industry That we now have a seemless web of energy services that has been developed What about environmental services Again the EU response is confusted and incomplete Apparently they feel that environmental services can be considered elsewhere in the negotiation Who from the EU drafted this paper The staff has changed and we dont know how high in their heirarchy this was considered Carol Balassa responded that she is trying to determine who drafted the response Brian Petty advised that his intelligence is that energy services is being discussed and considered at the highest levels of the Commission Carol told us that she is trying to get everything together before talking to the EU in January when she hopes to specifically respond and discuss their current returned response Therefore she is asking the Energy Services Coalition to complete the work of our four Working Groups which will allow the Hills people to develop the definition and basic negotiating position papers The DOS representative then suggested that we engage in somecapacity building This was defined as an outreach program to brief WTO member delegations on the meaning of energy services Carol suggested that after her January meeting the EU could be agreeable to having our industry group meet with their representatives to explain how energy services has evolved and what is included in energy services We moved to a discussion of the definitions paper itself Bob Fisher reminded those present that the current matrix developed for the APEC process was still an excellent guide to definitions although items such as renewables heating and certain trading and financial services would need to be added To meet some EU concerns that they are not a party to APEC and therefore suspicious of any such document we should remove the reference to APEC Our group pointed to the Tim Richards paper developed for our Electricity Working Group which gives a broad definition but then contains a footnote known as the illustrative list which lists the various items that we believe constitute energy services under that heading Bob Fisher said that this was the likely format we would ultimately adopt in the material prepared for USTR and others in the WTO process Bob said that once negotiators agree on the need for liberalized energy services they can fit whatever they want under the broad definition The last question raised was what happens to the ATL accelerated tariff liberalization which also covers some energy matters which WTO countries had contemplated being approved in Seattle Carol said that she did not know The meeting then adjourned The ESC needs to complete the Working Group process and complete the questionaire at the earliest possible time to allow the Hills people to prepare the basic document Working Group chairs are to be asked to complete this process by mid January Dear Reviewers Please review at your earliest opportunity make corrections additions and whatever and return to me for distribution Distribution will be to our ESC Executive Committee first and then to our entire membership of not to those who have not signed on as members and to USG participants

developing a briefing paper for the ASEAN Trade Ministers who will be attending the World Trade Organization Ministerials in Seattle WA later this year Trade representatives from Brunei Malaysia Indonesia Singapore the Philippines and Thailand are expected to attend To ensure that member concerns are addressed in the paper please send commentssuggestions regarding the below draft to me at by cob Friday November I will circulate a final draft the week of November Thank you USASEAN Business Council Briefing Paper PRIORITY BUSINESS ISSUES prepared in advance of the WTO Ministerials November A group of of Americas leading companies the USASEAN Business Council prides itself as being dedicated to effectively strengthen bilateral and USASEAN relations through strong economic and commercial ties The Council is committed to promoting open and free trade globally with the belief that such an environment is of benefit to all Open and transparent markets translate into economic growth and the opportunity to raise the standards of living of the worlds people In addition to providing a larger range of goods and services rulesbased open markets allow countries to be more competitive in the international arena In this spirit the Councils members offer this briefing paper as a compilation of the commercial issues we consider of highest priority at the onset of the new round of the WTO negotiations This is not a comprehensive roster rather attention has been given to issues which Hold priority status for American businesses seeking to expand their trade and investment ties in ASEAN and Have been advanced significantly through the APEC process and have a realistic prospect of being concluded within the three year timeframe PRIORITY ISSUES Accelerated Tariff Liberalization The agreement reached at the recent APEC Leaders Meeting in Auckland has provided the critical mass necessary for action on accelerated tariff liberalization in eight priority sectors within the framework of the WTO Continued tariff reduction will have wealth creating and efficiency enhancing effects on global trade The end result would be a larger international market that will encourage the continued foreign investment and global capital flows Agriculture A robust global food system that efficiently links food production food processing and consumption is vital to continuing development worldwide Council members support initiatives to remove all export subsidies and to reduce tariffs on agricultural products The Council also supports activities to ensure marketaccess for agricultural products enhanced with the use of biotechnology Use of this technology provides a safe and sufficient food supply while ensuring the safety of food sources and environment through strong and transparent sciencebased domestic regulatory systems Customs issues The Council is encouraged by the positive progress being made in the area of Customs reform and liberalization In the context of this ongoing cooperation members hope to see the adoption of the International Express Carriers Conference IECC Guidelines for Customs and encourage governments to continue to address electronic preclearance in a paperless environment twentyfour hour customs operation elimination of export clearance procedures higher deminimus levels transshipment without processing and payment of duties and taxes for imports at defined periods rather than upon arrival Each of these actions would improve the speed or lower the expense of shipment Countries that have adopted measures along the lines of the above have reduced the bottleneck effect that Customs can create and have improved the competitive environment for companies within their borders This attracts investment which creates jobs and wealth Ecommerce In the past few years electric or ECommerce has expanded the depth and breadth of global commerce Although the physical infrastructure is quickly spreading to support such transactions the legal and regulatory framework is still being developed Both suppliers and consumers of Ecommerce will benefit from an improved legal environment and measures to benchmark policies and best practices in member economies To ensure that the industry continues to develop the WTO should give special priority to adopting a permanent moratorium on the imposition of duties on electronic commerce Energy With growing demand for energy and calls for clean and efficient use of resources the WTO should look to promote the diversification of energy supply and a marketdriven energy infrastructure development Wellfunctioning markets greater energy efficiency and information flows among market participants will aid in sustainable and equitable growth globally The WTO should support initiatives like the APEC Natural Gas Initiative signed by the Energy Ministers at Okinawa last year and the ongoing policy dialogues to address energy serviceoriented issues related to the development extraction production distribution marketing consumption of all energy products ITA The US private sector applauds the advances made under the International Technology Agreement ITA and looks forward to the beginning of negotiations for the second phase of the agreement While the November ITA II package does not meet all of our expectations the Councils members are confident agreements resulting from the successful passage of ITA II will increase product coverage encourage progress on the elimination of nontariff measures and lead to the harmonization of tariff classification of products already covered in previous negotiation rounds The continued review and revision of the ITAs product coverage will further expand and distribute the benefits of information technology globally and is a fundamental necessity for such a fastpaced dynamic industry Although the Council would encourage discussion of ITAII during the upcoming round of WTO negotiations we believe that the ITAII negotiations should remain independent and should be concluded as soon as possible

demonstrators are out in force this morning and we plan to stay as far away from them as possible Joe Hillings Forwarded by Lora SullivanCorpEnron on AM From Chris Long PM To Lora NRON cc Subject WTO Notes INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE WTO The World Trade Organization WTO Ministerial meeting began yesterday in Seattle well almost An event scheduled for Monday was delayed for f our hours because of a breach of security The official opening will not occur until today but the behind the scenes meetings and negotiations beg an Monday November th and will continue until December rd In reality the re are two events going on One is a circus media event taking place in the streets of Seattle and the second is the serious trade negotiations going o n between the trade ministers of countries There are many important people appearing this week to include President Clinton Even Fiedel Castr o has been invited to speak at the University of Washington which is located less than a mile from the WTO activities The circus events in the street are designed to sever the communications between world trade officials and the rest of the world While it has its comic side its basic aim is anything but funny If the true story of trad e cannot be told the only view that the world gets of the WTO is that it is an event not to be taken seriously The street events are sort of like the shell on an egg They prevent you from seeing the egg itself but the shell is not the substance of the egg In an attempt to make certain the media events in the street do not succee d as far as Halliburton is concerned I will attempt to give you a fair and balanced account of what is really going on for the next four days This i s truly an interesting ministerial round of negotiations in that even Seattle cant seem to get a grip on what they stand for They bid on and won th e right to host the WTO this year and it will mean millions in income for the city There are signs along the streets welcoming the WTO At the same time the city of Seattle and the country it is located in are heavily pro union and they are sponsoring a huge antiWTO rally They have gra nted permits for antiWTO parades on busy streets during rush hours which makes many downtown workers less than happy These workers then vent their frustration against the WTO for causing the streets to be blocked Life in Seattle can best be described as schizophrenic INSIDE THE WTO Here is the inside Story From November th to December rd mos t of the worlds trade representatives are meeting in Seattle in private Meetin gs will not be in the open for fear of disruption Demonstrators then use thi s fact to say the talks are secrete because they are really all about world dominance The truth is that the trade ministers will be reviewing the global trading system and attempting to insure its dynamism and responsiveness in the years to come Talks actually began in Geneva earlie r this year but the formal meetings to reach agreement will be this week For years the WTO formally known as the GATT for General Agre ement on Tariffs and Trade has attempted to open world trade markets and set predictable and stable rules for trade During this year period there has been an fold growth in international trade This was a reversal of what is now widely recognized as disastrous policies of the s when increased trade barriers discrimination among trading partners and an absence of agreed rules helped fuel the Great Depression The beginning of this ministerial round finds some important issues to be resolved in order to eliminate barriers that currently inhibit trade The largest barrier is agriculture because European and Japanese farmers are heavily subsidized so that they can compete with the United States The United States Trade Representative USTR office listed seven other issues of concern to be discussed and agree upon during the negotiations Most important to Halliburton is the issue of services Our company performs energy services all over the world but the WTO has never looked at trade barriers in the energy services area The USTR representative present at t he kickoff meeting on Monday morning was asked if energy services were being discussed in this round and she assured us that it would be a significant part of the new negotiations The USTR is hopeful that this week will end with agreements between all parties as to the issues to be resolved over th e next three years and they are confident of success OUTSIDE THE WTO A small band of demonstrators most dressed like skeletons animals and turtles took to the streets on Sunday November th for a preview of thing s to come They demonstrated in front of the GAP clothing store downtown A number of the demonstrators were seen to be wearing GAP jeans and jackets under their skeleton suits They were demonstrating against GAPs use of slave labor Street interviews indicated that no one was to articu late about where these slaves were The crowd of about was well organized if uninformed and moved to an abandon warehouse where they broke into the building in order to occupy it Police did not attempt to eject them they simply cut of the power and water to this old concrete damp and cold building In addition homeless people through out Seattle were moved duri ng the weekend for the duration of the WTO in order to allow demonstrators the opportunity to occupy their places on the streets It seems many of the demonstrators had neglected to make reservations elsewhere Rain is expect ed Tuesday and Wednesday which should add to the demonstrators woes Seattle morning news carried a very level broadcast listing the environmental and labor demands of the demonstrators and also relating the fact that billion in trade is done by Washington each year milli on in grain alone was sold to Japan during Somewhere in excess of o f Washingtons economy is based on foreign trade and they are now the thir d largest trading state behind California and Texas This all adds to the schizophrenia that is beginning to be known as Seattle

Ruggiero former Director General of the World Trade Organization WTO spoke at a dinner for members of the Coalition for Service Industries on Wednesday evening His remarks were some of the best made during the WTO Seattle Round but were off the record and will probably not appear in print Among his observations were billion people residing in countries are trying to get into the WTO at this time The WTO is regarded by many as the organization needed to deal with the globalization in which all nations now find themselves Labor and environmental issues already have forums in which to have their issues heard Their problem is that nothing works as well as the WTO That they want to move their issues into the WTO area is not only understandable it is flattering Concerning the demonstrations As long as reason rules over emotions in this world the WTO will prevail The demonstrators goals may be right I dont know But their aim is wrong The WTO should not be their target The demonstrators have had the effect of making ministers even more determined to finish their work The Seattle Round has had an interesting ancillary result Environmental groups previously in disagreement or acting independently have taken the occasion of the WTO meeting to unify Greenpeace The Sierra Club Friends of the Earth The National Wildlife Federation and The World Wildlife Fund have been meeting before and during the Seattle Round Their goal is to put a sharp focus on what they want from the WTO As of this writing it is not clear if they wish to put the WTO out of business or get their issues made part of the negotiations but the latter is more likely What ever they decide the coalition of these environmentalists will be much more likely to be heard in the future Prior to the Presidents arrival agriculture and other difficult issues were making significant headway towards resolving differences The President arrived in Seattle on Wednesday amongst hopes that his visit would have a positive effect on negotiations but the opposite occurred His ability to communicate was put to good use as he spoke to all facets of the WTO to include the demonstrators and until he granted an interview with the Financial Times the best possible face was being put on WTO negotiations The Times article was published on Thursday however and it upset everyone In the interview President Clinton stated that core standards on labor should be adopted by the WTO and included in all trade agreements If they were not followed they should be enforced with sanctions Until these remarks the administration had maintained that only a working group on labor should be established with the mission of analyzing links between trade and labor The idea of a working group was gaining steam until the interview was published The United States Trade Representative was rumored to be very upset and the Presidents remarks met with almost universal condemnation Delegates from Japan and the European Union made strong statements of disagreement as did most of the developing nations Many see the use of sanctions as the antithesis of the WTOs mission There was speculation that the remarks were made to assist Vice President Gore with labor in his bid for the White House and that the President did not really believe they would have any effect within the WTO They did and the effect was all negative President Clinton made the rounds of a number of parties that evening to include one hosted for the members of congress who had worked on the African Trade bill At one time prior to the Presidents arrival there were members of Congress on the stage with Representative Charles Rangel DNY and it was the broadest possible array of political beliefs Individuals representing the most liberal side of the Democrat party stood side by side with individuals from the most conservative side of the Republican party all waiting for the President When he didnt appear the congressional representatives left the stage and mingled with about guests It was a lobbyists dream For minutes they talked joked and lobbied while they waited for the President He arrived made a predictable speech and left the stage only to find that for security reasons he would have to remain in the room awhile longer It turned out to be one of the most festive events of the week OUTSIDE people were arrested as of Thursday morning Delegates from many countries were surprised that the arrests were so long in coming and expressed significant displeasure with the turmoil in the streets Third world countries have been the most critical Their concerns focus on improving their economies They need infrastructure and financing before they can worry about the plight of sea turtles in oceans that dont even boarder their countries Many of them do not disagree with Americas basic goals but they believe that rich countries ideals are standing in the way of third world countries progress As days of disturbance continue the humor of the demonstrations is diminishing What is left are hard core anarchists bent simply on destruction The positive side of all this is that the goodness of people in Seattle is now beginning to show itself King Country Councilman Brian Derdowski took to the streets Tuesday evening surveying the damage and trying to mollify the crowds He saw a man grab a sack of coffee at a vandalized Starbucks and he approached him Derdowski told the wouldbe looter he really shouldnt take the bag of beans and the man dropped the bag hugged the Councilman and then walked away from the riots Nancy Woodland and her husband both Seattle attorneys saw the violence on television on Tuesday By Wednesday afternoon they were in the heart of town with Windex Comet SOS and elbow grease They spent most of the day cleaning the storefronts of other peoples businesses Terry Webb who owns a greeting card store has seen his business drop by When interviewed by a local newspaper he simply smiled and reached for one of his cards He handed the reporter a card that read Tough times are like speed bumps They only slow you down for a little This will be my last report from Seattle Don DAVE GRIBBIN Vice President

Hillings The notes look great I have made a couple of technical corrections to the document which I am attaching as a separate file To all everyone here at Hills company hopes you have a wonderful holiday Bob Fisher Hills Company Dear Friends Please review correct make additions and return Joe The Energy Services Coalition please note that we are no longer using US WTO ESC met at the request of Carol Balassa of USTR to get her perspective on energy services negotiations of the WTO and what our coalition needs to accomplish as well as a time perspective Present from the USG were Carol Balassa USTR Josephine Ludolph and Richard Boll DOC Russ Profozich DOE Patricia Norman DOS and a regular from the ITC Joe Hillings Christina Bolton Bob Fisher Steve Burns Brian Petty and Chris Long represented the ESC Carol conducted an extensive and excellent briefing listing several phases of activity She started the session by telling those present that the lack of action at Seattle was not a negative on what we need to accomplish this coming year We are on track and need to produce various position papers as early as the end of January Articles of the GATT requires that the WTO make progress on agriculture and services issues although it does not identify a date certain to achieve agreement Ambassador Barshefsky is committed to beginning services negotiations beginning in January A Committee on Specific Committments is charged with the responsibility to draft issues The USTR wants to have a definition of issues from the ESC by the end of January to be submitted to the USG representatives on the Committee A second significant group in the process is the Working Group On Domestic RightsThis group is chaired by Peter Collins Peter needs to know what are the domestic regulatory issues that could be raised by other WTO members as reasons not to liberalize various sectors This information is to be supplied in the first half of In late spring after group one and two have done a significant part of their work the USTR will be deciding what additional principles are needed to be tabled in the negotiation They expect these working groups will begin to meet at the WTO by the end of next summer Three basic columns headed by Market Access National Treatment Additional Committments Could be proposed annex such as the process Tim Richards has proposed in our Electricity Working Group listing examples is the format to be developed for the two groups Carol advised us that whatever we develop should be with the intention of getting Less Developed Countries LDCs supporting our basic principles in case a multilateral negotiation is not launched We should work the current liberalization process being prosecuted in the APEC and FTAA negotiations The next phase of Carols presentation addressed the recent response USTR received to the questions they submitted to DG it no longer exisits under the new commission asking the EU to address their feelings about the liberalization of energy services We have not been given a copy of the EU response and Carol has asked Ms Klinkers of the EU if the response can be shared with the ESC to secure industry responce Carol and others from the USG attending the meeting are trying to ascertain just who drafted the responses which they characterized as confusing and not indicating a real understanding of the current practices and developments in the energy services sector We do know that the USG has called this office to ask how they need to respond to the EU response that electricity is a good and not a service Our immediate response is that this is a matter of some disagreement among EU members and the EU staff The movement of electricity across national boundries may be a good but the sale and trading of electricity is definately a service The EU response we were told makes the agrument that in their view that many of the items raised in the October paper of the USTR were GAT covered such as construction engineering etc and therefore may not need to be raised in the services negotiations although these items will at least need some sort of annex to make sure they are included The EU believes that if you own or operate electricity producting then its a good but if you operate an IPP to sell electricity to various parties its a service We were told that the EU response does not seem to understand or cover renewables such as wind and solar both of which are important in Europes plan to diversify and develop green energy They also believe that pricerisk management should be considered under finance services not energy services The session was then open to general discussion Bob Fisher commented that the EU does not seem to understand the scope of todays energy services industry That we now have a seemless web of energy services that has been developed What about environmental services Again the EU response is confusted and incomplete Apparently they feel that environmental services can be considered elsewhere in the negotiation Who from the EU drafted this paper The staff has changed and we dont know how high in their heirarchy this was considered Carol Balassa responded that she is trying to determine who drafted the response Brian Petty advised that his intelligence is that energy services is being discussed and considered at the highest levels of the Commission Carol told us that she is trying to get everything together before talking to the EU in January when she hopes to specifically respond and discuss their current returned response Therefore she is asking the Energy Services Coalition to complete the work of our four Working Groups which will allow the Hills people to develop the definition and basic negotiating position papers The DOS representative then suggested that we engage in somecapacity building This was defined as an outreach program to brief WTO member delegations on the meaning of energy services Carol suggested that after her January meeting the EU could be agreeable to having our industry group meet with their representatives to explain how energy services has evolved and what is included in energy services We moved to a discussion of the definitions paper itself Bob Fisher reminded those present that the current matrix developed for the APEC process was still an excellent guide to definitions although items such as renewables heating and certain trading and financial services would need to be added To meet some EU concerns that they are not a party to APEC and therefore suspicious of any such document we should remove the reference to APEC Our group pointed to the Tim Richards paper developed for our Electricity Working Group which gives a broad definition but then contains a footnote known as the illustrative list which lists the various items that we believe constitute energy services under that heading Bob Fisher said that this was the likely format we would ultimately adopt in the material prepared for USTR and others in the WTO process Bob said that once negotiators agree on the need for liberalized energy services they can fit whatever they want under the broad definition The last question raised was what happens to the ATL accelerated tariff liberalization which also covers some energy matters which WTO countries had contemplated being approved in Seattle Carol said that she did not know The meeting then adjourned The ESC needs to complete the Working Group process and complete the questionaire at the earliest possible time to allow the Hills people to prepare the basic document Working Group chairs are to be asked to complete this process by mid January Dear Reviewers Please review at your earliest opportunity make corrections additions and whatever and return to me for distribution Distribution will be to our ESC Executive Committee first and then to our entire membership of not to those who have not signed on as members and to USG participants

developing a briefing paper for the ASEAN Trade Ministers who will be attending the World Trade Organization Ministerials in Seattle WA later this year Trade representatives from Brunei Malaysia Indonesia Singapore the Philippines and Thailand are expected to attend To ensure that member concerns are addressed in the paper please send commentssuggestions regarding the below draft to me at by cob Friday November I will circulate a final draft the week of November Thank you USASEAN Business Council Briefing Paper PRIORITY BUSINESS ISSUES prepared in advance of the WTO Ministerials November A group of of Americas leading companies the USASEAN Business Council prides itself as being dedicated to effectively strengthen bilateral and USASEAN relations through strong economic and commercial ties The Council is committed to promoting open and free trade globally with the belief that such an environment is of benefit to all Open and transparent markets translate into economic growth and the opportunity to raise the standards of living of the worlds people In addition to providing a larger range of goods and services rulesbased open markets allow countries to be more competitive in the international arena In this spirit the Councils members offer this briefing paper as a compilation of the commercial issues we consider of highest priority at the onset of the new round of the WTO negotiations This is not a comprehensive roster rather attention has been given to issues which Hold priority status for American businesses seeking to expand their trade and investment ties in ASEAN and Have been advanced significantly through the APEC process and have a realistic prospect of being concluded within the three year timeframe PRIORITY ISSUES Accelerated Tariff Liberalization The agreement reached at the recent APEC Leaders Meeting in Auckland has provided the critical mass necessary for action on accelerated tariff liberalization in eight priority sectors within the framework of the WTO Continued tariff reduction will have wealth creating and efficiency enhancing effects on global trade The end result would be a larger international market that will encourage the continued foreign investment and global capital flows Agriculture A robust global food system that efficiently links food production food processing and consumption is vital to continuing development worldwide Council members support initiatives to remove all export subsidies and to reduce tariffs on agricultural products The Council also supports activities to ensure marketaccess for agricultural products enhanced with the use of biotechnology Use of this technology provides a safe and sufficient food supply while ensuring the safety of food sources and environment through strong and transparent sciencebased domestic regulatory systems Customs issues The Council is encouraged by the positive progress being made in the area of Customs reform and liberalization In the context of this ongoing cooperation members hope to see the adoption of the International Express Carriers Conference IECC Guidelines for Customs and encourage governments to continue to address electronic preclearance in a paperless environment twentyfour hour customs operation elimination of export clearance procedures higher deminimus levels transshipment without processing and payment of duties and taxes for imports at defined periods rather than upon arrival Each of these actions would improve the speed or lower the expense of shipment Countries that have adopted measures along the lines of the above have reduced the bottleneck effect that Customs can create and have improved the competitive environment for companies within their borders This attracts investment which creates jobs and wealth Ecommerce In the past few years electric or ECommerce has expanded the depth and breadth of global commerce Although the physical infrastructure is quickly spreading to support such transactions the legal and regulatory framework is still being developed Both suppliers and consumers of Ecommerce will benefit from an improved legal environment and measures to benchmark policies and best practices in member economies To ensure that the industry continues to develop the WTO should give special priority to adopting a permanent moratorium on the imposition of duties on electronic commerce Energy With growing demand for energy and calls for clean and efficient use of resources the WTO should look to promote the diversification of energy supply and a marketdriven energy infrastructure development Wellfunctioning markets greater energy efficiency and information flows among market participants will aid in sustainable and equitable growth globally The WTO should support initiatives like the APEC Natural Gas Initiative signed by the Energy Ministers at Okinawa last year and the ongoing policy dialogues to address energy serviceoriented issues related to the development extraction production distribution marketing consumption of all energy products ITA The US private sector applauds the advances made under the International Technology Agreement ITA and looks forward to the beginning of negotiations for the second phase of the agreement While the November ITA II package does not meet all of our expectations the Councils members are confident agreements resulting from the successful passage of ITA II will increase product coverage encourage progress on the elimination of nontariff measures and lead to the harmonization of tariff classification of products already covered in previous negotiation rounds The continued review and revision of the ITAs product coverage will further expand and distribute the benefits of information technology globally and is a fundamental necessity for such a fastpaced dynamic industry Although the Council would encourage discussion of ITAII during the upcoming round of WTO negotiations we believe that the ITAII negotiations should remain independent and should be concluded as soon as possible

Notes INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE WTO The World Trade Organization WTO Ministerial meeting began yesterday in Seattle well almost An event scheduled for Monday was delayed for f our hours because of a breach of security The official opening will not occur until today but the behind the scenes meetings and negotiations beg an Monday November th and will continue until December rd In reality the re are two events going on One is a circus media event taking place in the streets of Seattle and the second is the serious trade negotiations going o n between the trade ministers of countries There are many important people appearing this week to include President Clinton Even Fiedel Castr o has been invited to speak at the University of Washington which is located less than a mile from the WTO activities The circus events in the street are designed to sever the communications between world trade officials and the rest of the world While it has its comic side its basic aim is anything but funny If the true story of trad e cannot be told the only view that the world gets of the WTO is that it is an event not to be taken seriously The street events are sort of like the shell on an egg They prevent you from seeing the egg itself but the shell is not the substance of the egg In an attempt to make certain the media events in the street do not succee d as far as Halliburton is concerned I will attempt to give you a fair and balanced account of what is really going on for the next four days This i s truly an interesting ministerial round of negotiations in that even Seattle cant seem to get a grip on what they stand for They bid on and won th e right to host the WTO this year and it will mean millions in income for the city There are signs along the streets welcoming the WTO At the same time the city of Seattle and the country it is located in are heavily pro union and they are sponsoring a huge antiWTO rally They have gra nted permits for antiWTO parades on busy streets during rush hours which makes many downtown workers less than happy These workers then vent their frustration against the WTO for causing the streets to be blocked Life in Seattle can best be described as schizophrenic INSIDE THE WTO Here is the inside Story From November th to December rd mos t of the worlds trade representatives are meeting in Seattle in private Meetin gs will not be in the open for fear of disruption Demonstrators then use thi s fact to say the talks are secrete because they are really all about world dominance The truth is that the trade ministers will be reviewing the global trading system and attempting to insure its dynamism and responsiveness in the years to come Talks actually began in Geneva earlie r this year but the formal meetings to reach agreement will be this week For years the WTO formally known as the GATT for General Agre ement on Tariffs and Trade has attempted to open world trade markets and set predictable and stable rules for trade During this year period there has been an fold growth in international trade This was a reversal of what is now widely recognized as disastrous policies of the s when increased trade barriers discrimination among trading partners and an absence of agreed rules helped fuel the Great Depression The beginning of this ministerial round finds some important issues to be resolved in order to eliminate barriers that currently inhibit trade The largest barrier is agriculture because European and Japanese farmers are heavily subsidized so that they can compete with the United States The United States Trade Representative USTR office listed seven other issues of concern to be discussed and agree upon during the negotiations Most important to Halliburton is the issue of services Our company performs energy services all over the world but the WTO has never looked at trade barriers in the energy services area The USTR representative present at t he kickoff meeting on Monday morning was asked if energy services were being discussed in this round and she assured us that it would be a significant part of the new negotiations The USTR is hopeful that this week will end with agreements between all parties as to the issues to be resolved over th e next three years and they are confident of success OUTSIDE THE WTO A small band of demonstrators most dressed like skeletons animals and turtles took to the streets on Sunday November th for a preview of thing s to come They demonstrated in front of the GAP clothing store downtown A number of the demonstrators were seen to be wearing GAP jeans and jackets under their skeleton suits They were demonstrating against GAPs use of slave labor Street interviews indicated that no one was to articu late about where these slaves were The crowd of about was well organized if uninformed and moved to an abandon warehouse where they broke into the building in order to occupy it Police did not attempt to eject them they simply cut of the power and water to this old concrete damp and cold building In addition homeless people through out Seattle were moved duri ng the weekend for the duration of the WTO in order to allow demonstrators the opportunity to occupy their places on the streets It seems many of the demonstrators had neglected to make reservations elsewhere Rain is expect ed Tuesday and Wednesday which should add to the demonstrators woes Seattle morning news carried a very level broadcast listing the environmental and labor demands of the demonstrators and also relating the fact that billion in trade is done by Washington each year milli on in grain alone was sold to Japan during Somewhere in excess of o f Washingtons economy is based on foreign trade and they are now the thir d largest trading state behind California and Texas This all adds to the schizophrenia that is beginning to be known as Seattle 
<4986534.1075848073811.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lora.sullivan@enron.com,1999-12-03 01:57:00,Report from WTO Part IV Cc Halliburton Subject Report from WTO Part IV INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE WTO INSIDE Renato Ruggiero former Director General of the World Trade Organization WTO spoke at a dinner for members of the Coalition for Service Industries on Wednesday evening His remarks were some of the best made during the WTO Seattle Round but were off the record and will probably not appear in print Among his observations were billion people residing in countries are trying to get into the WTO at this time The WTO is regarded by many as the organization needed to deal with the globalization in which all nations now find themselves Labor and environmental issues already have forums in which to have their issues heard Their problem is that nothing works as well as the WTO That they want to move their issues into the WTO area is not only understandable it is flattering Concerning the demonstrations As long as reason rules over emotions in this world the WTO will prevail The demonstrators goals may be right I dont know But their aim is wrong The WTO should not be their target The demonstrators have had the effect of making ministers even more determined to finish their work The Seattle Round has had an interesting ancillary result Environmental groups previously in disagreement or acting independently have taken the occasion of the WTO meeting to unify Greenpeace The Sierra Club Friends of the Earth The National Wildlife Federation and The World Wildlife Fund have been meeting before and during the Seattle Round Their goal is to put a sharp focus on what they want from the WTO As of this writing it is not clear if they wish to put the WTO out of business or get their issues made part of the negotiations but the latter is more likely What ever they decide the coalition of these environmentalists will be much more likely to be heard in the future Prior to the Presidents arrival agriculture and other difficult issues were making significant headway towards resolving differences The President arrived in Seattle on Wednesday amongst hopes that his visit would have a positive effect on negotiations but the opposite occurred His ability to communicate was put to good use as he spoke to all facets of the WTO to include the demonstrators and until he granted an interview with the Financial Times the best possible face was being put on WTO negotiations The Times article was published on Thursday however and it upset everyone In the interview President Clinton stated that core standards on labor should be adopted by the WTO and included in all trade agreements If they were not followed they should be enforced with sanctions Until these remarks the administration had maintained that only a working group on labor should be established with the mission of analyzing links between trade and labor The idea of a working group was gaining steam until the interview was published The United States Trade Representative was rumored to be very upset and the Presidents remarks met with almost universal condemnation Delegates from Japan and the European Union made strong statements of disagreement as did most of the developing nations Many see the use of sanctions as the antithesis of the WTOs mission There was speculation that the remarks were made to assist Vice President Gore with labor in his bid for the White House and that the President did not really believe they would have any effect within the WTO They did and the effect was all negative President Clinton made the rounds of a number of parties that evening to include one hosted for the members of congress who had worked on the African Trade bill At one time prior to the Presidents arrival there were members of Congress on the stage with Representative Charles Rangel DNY and it was the broadest possible array of political beliefs Individuals representing the most liberal side of the Democrat party stood side by side with individuals from the most conservative side of the Republican party all waiting for the President When he didnt appear the congressional representatives left the stage and mingled with about guests It was a lobbyists dream For minutes they talked joked and lobbied while they waited for the President He arrived made a predictable speech and left the stage only to find that for security reasons he would have to remain in the room awhile longer It turned out to be one of the most festive events of the week OUTSIDE people were arrested as of Thursday morning Delegates from many countries were surprised that the arrests were so long in coming and expressed significant displeasure with the turmoil in the streets Third world countries have been the most critical Their concerns focus on improving their economies They need infrastructure and financing before they can worry about the plight of sea turtles in oceans that dont even boarder their countries Many of them do not disagree with Americas basic goals but they believe that rich countries ideals are standing in the way of third world countries progress As days of disturbance continue the humor of the demonstrations is diminishing What is left are hard core anarchists bent simply on destruction The positive side of all this is that the goodness of people in Seattle is now beginning to show itself King Country Councilman Brian Derdowski took to the streets Tuesday evening surveying the damage and trying to mollify the crowds He saw a man grab a sack of coffee at a vandalized Starbucks and he approached him Derdowski told the wouldbe looter he really shouldnt take the bag of beans and the man dropped the bag hugged the Councilman and then walked away from the riots Nancy Woodland and her husband both Seattle attorneys saw the violence on television on Tuesday By Wednesday afternoon they were in the heart of town with Windex Comet SOS and elbow grease They spent most of the day cleaning the storefronts of other peoples businesses Terry Webb who owns a greeting card store has seen his business drop by When interviewed by a local newspaper he simply smiled and reached for one of his cards He handed the reporter a card that read Tough times are like speed bumps They only slow you down for a little This will be my last report from Seattle Don DAVE GRIBBIN Vice President

Hillings The notes look great I have made a couple of technical corrections to the document which I am attaching as a separate file To all everyone here at Hills company hopes you have a wonderful holiday Bob Fisher Hills Company Dear Friends Please review correct make additions and return Joe The Energy Services Coalition please note that we are no longer using US WTO ESC met at the request of Carol Balassa of USTR to get her perspective on energy services negotiations of the WTO and what our coalition needs to accomplish as well as a time perspective Present from the USG were Carol Balassa USTR Josephine Ludolph and Richard Boll DOC Russ Profozich DOE Patricia Norman DOS and a regular from the ITC Joe Hillings Christina Bolton Bob Fisher Steve Burns Brian Petty and Chris Long represented the ESC Carol conducted an extensive and excellent briefing listing several phases of activity She started the session by telling those present that the lack of action at Seattle was not a negative on what we need to accomplish this coming year We are on track and need to produce various position papers as early as the end of January Articles of the GATT requires that the WTO make progress on agriculture and services issues although it does not identify a date certain to achieve agreement Ambassador Barshefsky is committed to beginning services negotiations beginning in January A Committee on Specific Committments is charged with the responsibility to draft issues The USTR wants to have a definition of issues from the ESC by the end of January to be submitted to the USG representatives on the Committee A second significant group in the process is the Working Group On Domestic RightsThis group is chaired by Peter Collins Peter needs to know what are the domestic regulatory issues that could be raised by other WTO members as reasons not to liberalize various sectors This information is to be supplied in the first half of In late spring after group one and two have done a significant part of their work the USTR will be deciding what additional principles are needed to be tabled in the negotiation They expect these working groups will begin to meet at the WTO by the end of next summer Three basic columns headed by Market Access National Treatment Additional Committments Could be proposed annex such as the process Tim Richards has proposed in our Electricity Working Group listing examples is the format to be developed for the two groups Carol advised us that whatever we develop should be with the intention of getting Less Developed Countries LDCs supporting our basic principles in case a multilateral negotiation is not launched We should work the current liberalization process being prosecuted in the APEC and FTAA negotiations The next phase of Carols presentation addressed the recent response USTR received to the questions they submitted to DG it no longer exisits under the new commission asking the EU to address their feelings about the liberalization of energy services We have not been given a copy of the EU response and Carol has asked Ms Klinkers of the EU if the response can be shared with the ESC to secure industry responce Carol and others from the USG attending the meeting are trying to ascertain just who drafted the responses which they characterized as confusing and not indicating a real understanding of the current practices and developments in the energy services sector We do know that the USG has called this office to ask how they need to respond to the EU response that electricity is a good and not a service Our immediate response is that this is a matter of some disagreement among EU members and the EU staff The movement of electricity across national boundries may be a good but the sale and trading of electricity is definately a service The EU response we were told makes the agrument that in their view that many of the items raised in the October paper of the USTR were GAT covered such as construction engineering etc and therefore may not need to be raised in the services negotiations although these items will at least need some sort of annex to make sure they are included The EU believes that if you own or operate electricity producting then its a good but if you operate an IPP to sell electricity to various parties its a service We were told that the EU response does not seem to understand or cover renewables such as wind and solar both of which are important in Europes plan to diversify and develop green energy They also believe that pricerisk management should be considered under finance services not energy services The session was then open to general discussion Bob Fisher commented that the EU does not seem to understand the scope of todays energy services industry That we now have a seemless web of energy services that has been developed What about environmental services Again the EU response is confusted and incomplete Apparently they feel that environmental services can be considered elsewhere in the negotiation Who from the EU drafted this paper The staff has changed and we dont know how high in their heirarchy this was considered Carol Balassa responded that she is trying to determine who drafted the response Brian Petty advised that his intelligence is that energy services is being discussed and considered at the highest levels of the Commission Carol told us that she is trying to get everything together before talking to the EU in January when she hopes to specifically respond and discuss their current returned response Therefore she is asking the Energy Services Coalition to complete the work of our four Working Groups which will allow the Hills people to develop the definition and basic negotiating position papers The DOS representative then suggested that we engage in somecapacity building This was defined as an outreach program to brief WTO member delegations on the meaning of energy services Carol suggested that after her January meeting the EU could be agreeable to having our industry group meet with their representatives to explain how energy services has evolved and what is included in energy services We moved to a discussion of the definitions paper itself Bob Fisher reminded those present that the current matrix developed for the APEC process was still an excellent guide to definitions although items such as renewables heating and certain trading and financial services would need to be added To meet some EU concerns that they are not a party to APEC and therefore suspicious of any such document we should remove the reference to APEC Our group pointed to the Tim Richards paper developed for our Electricity Working Group which gives a broad definition but then contains a footnote known as the illustrative list which lists the various items that we believe constitute energy services under that heading Bob Fisher said that this was the likely format we would ultimately adopt in the material prepared for USTR and others in the WTO process Bob said that once negotiators agree on the need for liberalized energy services they can fit whatever they want under the broad definition The last question raised was what happens to the ATL accelerated tariff liberalization which also covers some energy matters which WTO countries had contemplated being approved in Seattle Carol said that she did not know The meeting then adjourned The ESC needs to complete the Working Group process and complete the questionaire at the earliest possible time to allow the Hills people to prepare the basic document Working Group chairs are to be asked to complete this process by mid January Dear Reviewers Please review at your earliest opportunity make corrections additions and whatever and return to me for distribution Distribution will be to our ESC Executive Committee first and then to our entire membership of not to those who have not signed on as members and to USG participants

Hillings The notes look great I have made a couple of technical corrections to the document which I am attaching as a separate file To all everyone here at Hills company hopes you have a wonderful holiday Bob Fisher Hills Company Dear Friends Please review correct make additions and return Joe The Energy Services Coalition please note that we are no longer using US WTO ESC met at the request of Carol Balassa of USTR to get her perspective on energy services negotiations of the WTO and what our coalition needs to accomplish as well as a time perspective Present from the USG were Carol Balassa USTR Josephine Ludolph and Richard Boll DOC Russ Profozich DOE Patricia Norman DOS and a regular from the ITC Joe Hillings Christina Bolton Bob Fisher Steve Burns Brian Petty and Chris Long represented the ESC Carol conducted an extensive and excellent briefing listing several phases of activity She started the session by telling those present that the lack of action at Seattle was not a negative on what we need to accomplish this coming year We are on track and need to produce various position papers as early as the end of January Articles of the GATT requires that the WTO make progress on agriculture and services issues although it does not identify a date certain to achieve agreement Ambassador Barshefsky is committed to beginning services negotiations beginning in January A Committee on Specific Committments is charged with the responsibility to draft issues The USTR wants to have a definition of issues from the ESC by the end of January to be submitted to the USG representatives on the Committee A second significant group in the process is the Working Group On Domestic RightsThis group is chaired by Peter Collins Peter needs to know what are the domestic regulatory issues that could be raised by other WTO members as reasons not to liberalize various sectors This information is to be supplied in the first half of In late spring after group one and two have done a significant part of their work the USTR will be deciding what additional principles are needed to be tabled in the negotiation They expect these working groups will begin to meet at the WTO by the end of next summer Three basic columns headed by Market Access National Treatment Additional Committments Could be proposed annex such as the process Tim Richards has proposed in our Electricity Working Group listing examples is the format to be developed for the two groups Carol advised us that whatever we develop should be with the intention of getting Less Developed Countries LDCs supporting our basic principles in case a multilateral negotiation is not launched We should work the current liberalization process being prosecuted in the APEC and FTAA negotiations The next phase of Carols presentation addressed the recent response USTR received to the questions they submitted to DG it no longer exisits under the new commission asking the EU to address their feelings about the liberalization of energy services We have not been given a copy of the EU response and Carol has asked Ms Klinkers of the EU if the response can be shared with the ESC to secure industry responce Carol and others from the USG attending the meeting are trying to ascertain just who drafted the responses which they characterized as confusing and not indicating a real understanding of the current practices and developments in the energy services sector We do know that the USG has called this office to ask how they need to respond to the EU response that electricity is a good and not a service Our immediate response is that this is a matter of some disagreement among EU members and the EU staff The movement of electricity across national boundries may be a good but the sale and trading of electricity is definately a service The EU response we were told makes the agrument that in their view that many of the items raised in the October paper of the USTR were GAT covered such as construction engineering etc and therefore may not need to be raised in the services negotiations although these items will at least need some sort of annex to make sure they are included The EU believes that if you own or operate electricity producting then its a good but if you operate an IPP to sell electricity to various parties its a service We were told that the EU response does not seem to understand or cover renewables such as wind and solar both of which are important in Europes plan to diversify and develop green energy They also believe that pricerisk management should be considered under finance services not energy services The session was then open to general discussion Bob Fisher commented that the EU does not seem to understand the scope of todays energy services industry That we now have a seemless web of energy services that has been developed What about environmental services Again the EU response is confusted and incomplete Apparently they feel that environmental services can be considered elsewhere in the negotiation Who from the EU drafted this paper The staff has changed and we dont know how high in their heirarchy this was considered Carol Balassa responded that she is trying to determine who drafted the response Brian Petty advised that his intelligence is that energy services is being discussed and considered at the highest levels of the Commission Carol told us that she is trying to get everything together before talking to the EU in January when she hopes to specifically respond and discuss their current returned response Therefore she is asking the Energy Services Coalition to complete the work of our four Working Groups which will allow the Hills people to develop the definition and basic negotiating position papers The DOS representative then suggested that we engage in somecapacity building This was defined as an outreach program to brief WTO member delegations on the meaning of energy services Carol suggested that after her January meeting the EU could be agreeable to having our industry group meet with their representatives to explain how energy services has evolved and what is included in energy services We moved to a discussion of the definitions paper itself Bob Fisher reminded those present that the current matrix developed for the APEC process was still an excellent guide to definitions although items such as renewables heating and certain trading and financial services would need to be added To meet some EU concerns that they are not a party to APEC and therefore suspicious of any such document we should remove the reference to APEC Our group pointed to the Tim Richards paper developed for our Electricity Working Group which gives a broad definition but then contains a footnote known as the illustrative list which lists the various items that we believe constitute energy services under that heading Bob Fisher said that this was the likely format we would ultimately adopt in the material prepared for USTR and others in the WTO process Bob said that once negotiators agree on the need for liberalized energy services they can fit whatever they want under the broad definition The last question raised was what happens to the ATL accelerated tariff liberalization which also covers some energy matters which WTO countries had contemplated being approved in Seattle Carol said that she did not know The meeting then adjourned The ESC needs to complete the Working Group process and complete the questionaire at the earliest possible time to allow the Hills people to prepare the basic document Working Group chairs are to be asked to complete this process by mid January Dear Reviewers Please review at your earliest opportunity make corrections additions and whatever and

<24265317.1075846394041.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lora.sullivan@enron.com,1999-12-03 01:57:00,Report from WTO Part IV Cc Halliburton Subject Report from WTO Part IV INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE WTO INSIDE Renato Ruggiero former Director General of the World Trade Organization WTO spoke at a dinner for members of the Coalition for Service Industries on Wednesday evening His remarks were some of the best made during the WTO Seattle Round but were off the record and will probably not appear in print Among his observations were billion people residing in countries are trying to get into the WTO at this time The WTO is regarded by many as the organization needed to deal with the globalization in which all nations now find themselves Labor and environmental issues already have forums in which to have their issues heard Their problem is that nothing works as well as the WTO That they want to move their issues into the WTO area is not only understandable it is flattering Concerning the demonstrations As long as reason rules over emotions in this world the WTO will prevail The demonstrators goals may be right I dont know But their aim is wrong The WTO should not be their target The demonstrators have had the effect of making ministers even more determined to finish their work The Seattle Round has had an interesting ancillary result Environmental groups previously in disagreement or acting independently have taken the occasion of the WTO meeting to unify Greenpeace The Sierra Club Friends of the Earth The National Wildlife Federation and The World Wildlife Fund have been meeting before and during the Seattle Round Their goal is to put a sharp focus on what they want from the WTO As of this writing it is not clear if they wish to put the WTO out of business or get their issues made part of the negotiations but the latter is more likely What ever they decide the coalition of these environmentalists will be much more likely to be heard in the future Prior to the Presidents arrival agriculture and other difficult issues were making significant headway towards resolving differences The President arrived in Seattle on Wednesday amongst hopes that his visit would have a positive effect on negotiations but the opposite occurred His ability to communicate was put to good use as he spoke to all facets of the WTO to include the demonstrators and until he granted an interview with the Financial Times the best possible face was being put on WTO negotiations The Times article was published on Thursday however and it upset everyone In the interview President Clinton stated that core standards on labor should be adopted by the WTO and included in all trade agreements If they were not followed they should be enforced with sanctions Until these remarks the administration had maintained that only a working group on labor should be established with the mission of analyzing links between trade and labor The idea of a working group was gaining steam until the interview was published The United States Trade Representative was rumored to be very upset and the Presidents remarks met with almost universal condemnation Delegates from Japan and the European Union made strong statements of disagreement as did most of the developing nations Many see the use of sanctions as the antithesis of the WTOs mission There was speculation that the remarks were made to assist Vice President Gore with labor in his bid for the White House and that the President did not really believe they would have any effect within the WTO They did and the effect was all negative President Clinton made the rounds of a number of parties that evening to include one hosted for the members of congress who had worked on the African Trade bill At one time prior to the Presidents arrival there were members of Congress on the stage with Representative Charles Rangel DNY and it was the broadest possible array of political beliefs Individuals representing the most liberal side of the Democrat party stood side by side with individuals from the most conservative side of the Republican party all waiting for the President When he didnt appear the congressional representatives left the stage and mingled with about guests It was a lobbyists dream For minutes they talked joked and lobbied while they waited for the President He arrived made a predictable speech and left the stage only to find that for security reasons he would have to remain in the room awhile longer It turned out to be one of the most festive events of the week OUTSIDE people were arrested as of Thursday morning Delegates from many countries were surprised that the arrests were so long in coming and expressed significant displeasure with the turmoil in the streets Third world countries have been the most critical Their concerns focus on improving their economies They need infrastructure and financing before they can worry about the plight of sea turtles in oceans that dont even boarder their countries Many of them do not disagree with Americas basic goals but they believe that rich countries ideals are standing in the way of third world countries progress As days of disturbance continue the humor of the demonstrations is diminishing What is left are hard core anarchists bent simply on destruction The positive side of all this is that the goodness of people in Seattle is now beginning to show itself King Country Councilman Brian Derdowski took to the streets Tuesday evening surveying the damage and trying to mollify the crowds He saw a man grab a sack of coffee at a vandalized Starbucks and he approached him Derdowski told the wouldbe looter he really shouldnt take the bag of beans and the man dropped the bag hugged the Councilman and then walked away from the riots Nancy Woodland and her husband both Seattle attorneys saw the violence on television on Tuesday By Wednesday afternoon they were in the heart of town with Windex Comet SOS and elbow grease They spent most of the day cleaning the storefronts of other peoples businesses Terry Webb who owns a greeting card store has seen his business drop by When interviewed by a local newspaper he simply smiled and reached for one of his cards He handed the reporter a card that read Tough times are like speed bumps They only slow you down for a little This will be my last

demonstrators are out in force this morning and we plan to stay as far away from them as possible Joe Hillings Forwarded by Lora SullivanCorpEnron on AM From Chris Long PM To Lora NRON cc Subject WTO Notes INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE WTO The World Trade Organization WTO Ministerial meeting began yesterday in Seattle well almost An event scheduled for Monday was delayed for f our hours because of a breach of security The official opening will not occur until today but the behind the scenes meetings and negotiations beg an Monday November th and will continue until December rd In reality the re are two events going on One is a circus media event taking place in the streets of Seattle and the second is the serious trade negotiations going o n between the trade ministers of countries There are many important people appearing this week to include President Clinton Even Fiedel Castr o has been invited to speak at the University of Washington which is located less than a mile from the WTO activities The circus events in the street are designed to sever the communications between world trade officials and the rest of the world While it has its comic side its basic aim is anything but funny If the true story of trad e cannot be told the only view that the world gets of the WTO is that it is an event not to be taken seriously The street events are sort of like the shell on an egg They prevent you from seeing the egg itself but the shell is not the substance of the egg In an attempt to make certain the media events in the street do not succee d as far as Halliburton is concerned I will attempt to give you a fair and balanced account of what is really going on for the next four days This i s truly an interesting ministerial round of negotiations in that even Seattle cant seem to get a grip on what they stand for They bid on and won th e right to host the WTO this year and it will mean millions in income for the city There are signs along the streets welcoming the WTO At the same time the city of Seattle and the country it is located in are heavily pro union and they are sponsoring a huge antiWTO rally They have gra nted permits for antiWTO parades on busy streets during rush hours which makes many downtown workers less than happy These workers then vent their frustration against the WTO for causing the streets to be blocked Life in Seattle can best be described as schizophrenic INSIDE THE WTO Here is the inside Story From November th to December rd mos t of the worlds trade representatives are meeting in Seattle in private Meetin gs will not be in the open for fear of disruption Demonstrators then use thi s fact to say the talks are secrete because they are really all about world dominance The truth is that the trade ministers will be reviewing the global trading system and attempting to insure its dynamism and responsiveness in the years to come Talks actually began in Geneva earlie r this year but the formal meetings to reach agreement will be this week For years the WTO formally known as the GATT for General Agre ement on Tariffs and Trade has attempted to open world trade markets and set predictable and stable rules for trade During this year period there has been an fold growth in international trade This was a reversal of what is now widely recognized as disastrous policies of the s when increased trade barriers discrimination among trading partners and an absence of agreed rules helped fuel the Great Depression The beginning of this ministerial round finds some important issues to be resolved in order to eliminate barriers that currently inhibit trade The largest barrier is agriculture because European and Japanese farmers are heavily subsidized so that they can compete with the United States The United States Trade Representative USTR office listed seven other issues of concern to be discussed and agree upon during the negotiations Most important to Halliburton is the issue of services Our company performs energy services all over the world but the WTO has never looked at trade barriers in the energy services area The USTR representative present at t he kickoff meeting on Monday morning was asked if energy services were being discussed in this round and she assured us that it would be a significant part of the new negotiations The USTR is hopeful that this week will end with agreements between all parties as to the issues to be resolved over th e next three years and they are confident of success OUTSIDE THE WTO A small band of demonstrators most dressed like skeletons animals and turtles took to the streets on Sunday November th for a preview of thing s to come They demonstrated in front of the GAP clothing store downtown A number of the demonstrators were seen to be wearing GAP jeans and jackets under their skeleton suits They were demonstrating against GAPs use of slave labor Street interviews indicated that no one was to articu late about where these slaves were The crowd of about was well organized if uninformed and moved to an abandon warehouse where they broke into the building in order to occupy it Police did not attempt to eject them they simply cut of the power and water to this old concrete damp and cold building In addition homeless people through out Seattle were moved duri ng the weekend for the duration of the WTO in order to allow demonstrators the opportunity to occupy their places on the streets It seems many of the demonstrators had neglected to make reservations elsewhere Rain is expect ed Tuesday and Wednesday which should add to the demonstrators woes Seattle morning news carried a very level broadcast listing the environmental and labor demands of the demonstrators and also relating the fact that billion in trade is done by Washington each year milli on in grain alone was sold to Japan during Somewhere in excess of o f Washingtons economy is based on foreign trade and they are now the thir d largest trading state behind California and Texas This all adds to the schizophrenia that is beginning to be known as Seattle

Indonesia Singapore the Philippines and Thailand are expected to attend To ensure that member concerns are addressed in the paper please send commentssuggestions regarding the below draft to me at by cob Friday November I will circulate a final draft the week of November Thank you USASEAN Business Council Briefing Paper PRIORITY BUSINESS ISSUES prepared in advance of the WTO Ministerials November A group of of Americas leading companies the USASEAN Business Council prides itself as being dedicated to effectively strengthen bilateral and USASEAN relations through strong economic and commercial ties The Council is committed to promoting open and free trade globally with the belief that such an environment is of benefit to all Open and transparent markets translate into economic growth and the opportunity to raise the standards of living of the worlds people In addition to providing a larger range of goods and services rulesbased open markets allow countries to be more competitive in the international arena In this spirit the Councils members offer this briefing paper as a compilation of the commercial issues we consider of highest priority at the onset of the new round of the WTO negotiations This is not a comprehensive roster rather attention has been given to issues which Hold priority status for American businesses seeking to expand their trade and investment ties in ASEAN and Have been advanced significantly through the APEC process and have a realistic prospect of being concluded within the three year timeframe PRIORITY ISSUES Accelerated Tariff Liberalization The agreement reached at the recent APEC Leaders Meeting in Auckland has provided the critical mass necessary for action on accelerated tariff liberalization in eight priority sectors within the framework of the WTO Continued tariff reduction will have wealth creating and efficiency enhancing effects on global trade The end result would be a larger international market that will encourage the continued foreign investment and global capital flows Agriculture A robust global food system that efficiently links food production food processing and consumption is vital to continuing development worldwide Council members support initiatives to remove all export subsidies and to reduce tariffs on agricultural products The Council also supports activities to ensure marketaccess for agricultural products enhanced with the use of biotechnology Use of this technology provides a safe and sufficient food supply while ensuring the safety of food sources and environment through strong and transparent sciencebased domestic regulatory systems Customs issues The Council is encouraged by the positive progress being made in the area of Customs reform and liberalization In the context of this ongoing cooperation members hope to see the adoption of the International Express Carriers Conference IECC Guidelines for Customs and encourage governments to continue to address electronic preclearance in a paperless environment twentyfour hour customs operation elimination of export clearance procedures higher deminimus levels transshipment without processing and payment of duties and taxes for imports at defined periods rather than upon arrival Each of these actions would improve the speed or lower the expense of shipment Countries that have adopted measures along the lines of the above have reduced the bottleneck effect that Customs can create and have improved the competitive environment for companies within their borders This attracts investment which creates jobs and wealth Ecommerce In the past few years electric or ECommerce has expanded the depth and breadth of global commerce Although the physical infrastructure is quickly spreading to support such transactions the legal and regulatory framework is still being developed Both suppliers and consumers of Ecommerce will benefit from an improved legal environment and measures to benchmark policies and best practices in member economies To ensure that the industry continues to develop the WTO should give special priority to adopting a permanent moratorium on the imposition of duties on electronic commerce Energy With growing demand for energy and calls for clean and efficient use of resources the WTO should look to promote the diversification of energy supply and a marketdriven energy infrastructure development Wellfunctioning markets greater energy efficiency and information flows among market participants will aid in sustainable and equitable growth globally The WTO should support initiatives like the APEC Natural Gas Initiative signed by the Energy Ministers at Okinawa last year and the ongoing policy dialogues to address energy serviceoriented issues related to the development extraction production distribution marketing consumption of all energy products ITA The US private sector applauds the advances made under the International Technology Agreement ITA and looks forward to the beginning of negotiations for the second phase of the agreement While the November ITA II package does not meet all of our expectations the Councils members are confident agreements resulting from the successful passage of ITA II will increase product coverage encourage progress on the elimination of nontariff measures and lead to the harmonization of tariff classification of products already covered in previous negotiation rounds The continued review and revision of the ITAs product coverage will further expand and distribute the benefits of information technology globally and is a fundamental necessity for such a fastpaced dynamic industry Although the Council would encourage discussion of ITAII during the upcoming round of WTO negotiations we believe that the ITAII negotiations should remain independent and should be concluded as soon as possible

Post Staff Writers Thursday May Page A The key to the energy proposal President Bush unveils today can be found on a wall in the threeroom suite that houses his National Energy Policy Development Group next door to the White House in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building On the wall hangs a huge erasable board that serves as a giant checklist to guide the preparation of the administrations eightchapter energy policy which Bush formally unveils in Minnesota today For each chapter theres a check mark for two rough drafts a peer review a final draft two more rounds of recommendations on the drafts then graphics and photos Toward the end of the checklist is an allimportant box to check Concurrence of the OVP The OVP Office of the Vice President has driven every aspect of the energy report No proposed recommendation has survived without the consent of one man Vice President Cheney the administrations indispensable man and chair of the energy task force The release of the energy report shines a new spotlight on Cheney a quiet conservative from Wyoming who has been given credit for running the show without annoying or upstaging his boss The handling of the energy task force so far reflects Cheneys personality near perfectly It is a closely held process with a high regard for the concerns of industry This close involvement of Cheney is partially a strength because the effort has been efficient and wellmanaged But Cheneys strong role is also potentially the reports weakness He is about to undergo a blast of unwanted scrutiny as critics seize on his finances and oil industry ties in an effort to discredit the policy Democrats and environmental groups are charging that his judgment on energy matters is suspect because of his chairmanship until August of Halliburton Co a Dallasbased energy services firm that is expected to benefit from several parts of President Bushs policy Cheney made million last year most it in compensation from Halliburton including salary and his exercise of stock options and sale of restricted stock He is seeing the problem entirely from the side of the energy producing industry that made him a millionaire not from a consumer struggling to make ends meet said Philip E Clapp president of the National Environmental Trust An official close to Cheney called such suggestions an outrage and said his expertise in the industry and knowledge of its technology were crucial to trying to solve a problem of this magnitude Although the plan has extensive recommendations about using technology to conserve energy and produce power more cleanly the heart of the report is its conclusion that the United States needs hundreds more power plants natural gas pipelines oil wells and nuclear reactors Several administration officials acknowledged that Cheney had handed ammunition to his critics by declaring in a speech in Toronto on April that conservation may be a sign of personal virtue but is not a sound basis for a comprehensive energy policy Given his background he shouldve been real careful said Sen Charles E Schumer DNY who has offered an alternative energy plan that he says focuses equally on supply and demand I think theyve had some real stumbles Sen Craig Thomas R who succeeded Cheney as Wyomings lone House member in said he does not expect such criticism to rattle the circumspect Cheney Hell just say All right Thats the way it is folks Im doing my job Heres my plan Thomas said As always when questions are asked about Cheneys influence White House officials argue vigorously that the energy plan is Bushs plan An official close to Bush said Cheney and other task force members had updated the president often since beginning their work on Jan At several critical decision points the group has come to the president to ask him to make judgments and decisions the official said Cheneys directions are carried out by the task forces executive director Andrew Lundquist his deputy Karen Knudsen and four other staff members Cheney also chairs the task force itself which includes the secretaries of energy interior treasury agriculture commerce and transportation and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency Aides say Cheney met with only half a dozen of the interest groups seeking input into the policy including Enron Corp the Houston energy conglomerate that is a large and longtime Bush contributor and the Edison Electric Institute an energy trade group Vance Meyer a spokesman for Enron said the firms chairman Kenneth Lay and another executive had a minute meeting with Cheney Edison assembled or chief executives to meet with Cheney But Lundquist and Knudsen representing Cheney met with half of the or so groups industry environmental regulatory and academic that requested access Exactly which groups the Cheney advisers met with is being kept secret by the White House The task forces stealthy operation reflects Cheneys distaste for publicity Following news reports about the private nature of the energy deliberations Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Government Reform Committee requested information about the groups the task force met with Cheneys counsel David S Addington rebuffed the members of Congress arguing that there was no legal requirement to comply with the request In a sevenpage response to the request Lundquist wrote that the meetings were simply forums to collect individual views rather than to bring a collective judgment to bear White House officials have declined to disclose the list of meetings or attendees Aides said representatives at the meetings included energy industry or corporate groups renewable energy providers unions environmental groups five academics governmental groups six energy efficiency proponents and a consumer group Environmentalists complain that the meetings reflected Cheneys predispositions The vice president met with industry leaders while dispatching aides to speak to environmentalists several of which were grouped into one meeting The meetings of labor representatives who gathered in groups were publicized by the White House but sessions with industry were not Cheney who declined to be interviewed for this article told the Associated Press that he hasnt consulted with any officials from Halliburton and rejected the notion that the task forces work is compromised by his private meetings with industry officials who give money to the Republican Party Just because somebody makes a campaign contribution doesnt mean that they should be denied the opportunity to express their views to government officials he said Cheney chaired nine meetings of the Cabinetlevel task force mostly in his ceremonial office Each of the meetings attended by the task force members and aides lasted minutes with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christine Todd Whitman Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and Bush economic adviser Lawrence B Lindsey often reflecting different interests For minutes at the end of each session Cheney told staffers to leave the room so the top officials could settle differences privately without risk of the differences being leaked to the news media In only a few cases did Bush have to resolve disputes among advisers participants said In most cases Cheney was able discreetly to broker agreement among the Cabinet members The Washington Post Company

Post Staff Writers Thursday May Page A The key to the energy proposal President Bush unveils today can be found on a wall in the threeroom suite that houses his National Energy Policy Development Group next door to the White House in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building On the wall hangs a huge erasable board that serves as a giant checklist to guide the preparation of the administrations eightchapter energy policy which Bush formally unveils in Minnesota today For each chapter theres a check mark for two rough drafts a peer review a final draft two more rounds of recommendations on the drafts then graphics and photos Toward the end of the checklist is an allimportant box to check Concurrence of the OVP The OVP Office of the Vice President has driven every aspect of the energy report No proposed recommendation has survived without the consent of one man Vice President Cheney the administrations indispensable man and chair of the energy task force The release of the energy report shines a new spotlight on Cheney a quiet conservative from Wyoming who has been given credit for running the show without annoying or upstaging his boss The handling of the energy task force so far reflects Cheneys personality near perfectly It is a closely held process with a high regard for the concerns of industry This close involvement of Cheney is partially a strength because the effort has been efficient and wellmanaged But Cheneys strong role is also potentially the reports weakness He is about to undergo a blast of unwanted scrutiny as critics seize on his finances and oil industry ties in an effort to discredit the policy Democrats and environmental groups are charging that his judgment on energy matters is suspect because of his chairmanship until August of Halliburton Co a Dallasbased energy services firm that is expected to benefit from several parts of President Bushs policy Cheney made million last year most it in compensation from Halliburton including salary and his exercise of stock options and sale of restricted stock He is seeing the problem entirely from the side of the energy producing industry that made him a millionaire not from a consumer struggling to make ends meet said Philip E Clapp president of the National Environmental Trust An official close to Cheney called such suggestions an outrage and said his expertise in the industry and knowledge of its technology were crucial to trying to solve a problem of this magnitude Although the plan has extensive recommendations about using technology to conserve energy and produce power more cleanly the heart of the report is its conclusion that the United States needs hundreds more power plants natural gas pipelines oil wells and nuclear reactors Several administration officials acknowledged that Cheney had handed ammunition to his critics by declaring in a speech in Toronto on April that conservation may be a sign of personal virtue but is not a sound basis for a comprehensive energy policy Given his background he shouldve been real careful said Sen Charles E Schumer DNY who has offered an alternative energy plan that he says focuses equally on supply and demand I think theyve had some real stumbles Sen Craig Thomas R who succeeded Cheney as Wyomings lone House member in said he does not expect such criticism to rattle the circumspect Cheney Hell just say All right Thats the way it is folks Im doing my job Heres my plan Thomas said As always when questions are asked about Cheneys influence White House officials argue vigorously that the energy plan is Bushs plan An official close to Bush said Cheney and other task force members had updated the president often since beginning their work on Jan At several critical decision points the group has come to the president to ask him to make judgments and decisions the official said Cheneys directions are carried out by the task forces executive director Andrew Lundquist his deputy Karen Knudsen and four other staff members Cheney also chairs the task force itself which includes the secretaries of energy interior treasury agriculture commerce and transportation and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency Aides say Cheney met with only half a dozen of the interest groups seeking input into the policy including Enron Corp the Houston energy conglomerate that is a large and longtime Bush contributor and the Edison Electric Institute an energy trade group Vance Meyer a spokesman for Enron said the firms chairman Kenneth Lay and another executive had a minute meeting with Cheney Edison assembled or chief executives to meet with Cheney But Lundquist and Knudsen representing Cheney met with half of the or so groups industry environmental regulatory and academic that requested access Exactly which groups the Cheney advisers met with is being kept secret by the White House The task forces stealthy operation reflects Cheneys distaste for publicity Following news reports about the private nature of the energy deliberations Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Government Reform Committee requested information about the groups the task force met with Cheneys counsel David S Addington rebuffed the members of Congress arguing that there was no legal requirement to comply with the request In a sevenpage response to the request Lundquist wrote that the meetings were simply forums to collect individual views rather than to bring a collective judgment to bear White House officials have declined to disclose the list of meetings or attendees Aides said representatives at the meetings included energy industry or corporate groups renewable energy providers unions environmental groups five academics governmental groups six energy efficiency proponents and a consumer group Environmentalists complain that the meetings reflected Cheneys predispositions The vice president met with industry leaders while dispatching aides to speak to environmentalists several of which were grouped into one meeting The meetings of labor representatives who gathered in groups were publicized by the White House but sessions with industry were not Cheney who declined to be interviewed for this article told the Associated Press that he hasnt consulted with any officials from Halliburton and rejected the notion that the task forces work is compromised by his private meetings with industry officials who give money to the Republican Party Just because somebody makes a campaign contribution doesnt mean that they should be denied the opportunity to express their views to government officials he said Cheney chaired nine meetings of the Cabinetlevel task force mostly in his ceremonial office Each of the meetings attended by the task force members and aides lasted minutes with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christine Todd Whitman Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and Bush economic adviser Lawrence B Lindsey often reflecting different interests For minutes at the end of each session Cheney told staffers to leave the room so the top officials could settle differences privately without risk of the differences being leaked to the news media In only a few cases did Bush have to resolve disputes among advisers participants said In most cases Cheney was able discreetly to broker agreement among the Cabinet members The Washington Post Company

political environmental actions By David Whitney ScrippsMcClatchy Western Service WASHINGTON When Vice President Dick Cheney met with members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation to talk about the West Coast electricity crisis last month Californians were kept out of the room According to Rep Jay Inslee DWash Cheney wouldnt schedule a meeting if anyone from California was going to attend Cheney didnt personally tell me that but his staff did Inslee said later From Day One the administration has tried to isolate California Its not just the power controversy in which California finds itself on the outside If its Californians walking up the White House steps these days the odds are high that no one will open the door From insurance requirements on earthquakeprone federal buildings to proposals cutting support for alternative power sources Democrats and even some Republicans are beginning to think that California is on Bushs hit list Its premature to say this new crew dislikes California said Tim Ransdell executive director of the California Institute for Federal Policy Research a policy arm of the bipartisan member state congressional delegation But the early signals are that California is a lower priority than other states Ransdell said Consider the states plea for better treatment on budget items In February when the White House released a broad blueprint of its budget California lawmakers were stunned to see that it included million in savings at the Federal Emergency Management Agency resulting from a requirement that public buildings be privately insured On the surface this seems like a reasonable request But after dozens of insurance carriers declared bankruptcy under the weight of claims from the Loma Prieta earthquake in Northern California no one knows whether its even possible for cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco to buy coverage The disaster insurance idea was suggested last year during the Clinton administration and the entire California delegation rose up to stop it All members from the most conservative Republican to the most liberal Democrat signed onto a letter saying that that at the very least the government ought to study the wisdom of shifting public money from improving the earthquake integrity of buildings to buying insurance When Bush revived the idea in February California Republicans thought the new administration didnt understand The Republicans balked at attacking the idea in a joint letter with Democratic lawmakers and instead launched a campaign to educate the White House on why a bad idea under the Clinton administration remained a bad idea now It didnt work Last weeks final budget submission to Congress included the provision unchanged On another budget issue the White House slashed by million federal support that states receive for incarcerating undocumented criminals Because California typically receives more than percent of that pot that cut alone would cost the state nearly million Ransdell said the administrations attitude toward the state is putting enormous pressure on Republicans California Republicans dont want to be in a position of criticizing the president at the very beginning of the administration he said But he said that as these issues heat up he expects Republicans will soon start to break with the administration over issues on which they have been denied a voice I think they will fight back when they need to fight back Ransdell said The common explanation on why California is getting such lousy treatment is its politics The state voted strongly for Al Gore in the November elections All but one of its constitutional offices are occupied by elected Democrats The state Legislature and congressional delegations are firmly in the grip of Democrats And Gov Gray Davis a Democrat often mentioned as a possible challenger to Bush in is being hammered over the power crisis Several sources also noted that the contrast may be more vivid because Clinton and Gore were closely allied with California entertainment and hightech industries and often were in the state I think by this time in the ClintonGore administration they had been here four or five times said Bruce Cain director of the Institute for Governmental Studies at the University of CaliforniaBerkeley This can be looked at in a number of ways Cain said of the Bush administration The president may have decided that California is not essential to his reelection and that he can win in without the state Cain said Also he can use California as an object lesson to every other state that wants to go the route of environmentalism or openness to immigration Let them suffer from their own policies Leon Panetta President Clintons former chief of staff and a former California congressman thinks the Bush administrations early treatment of the state is very shortsighted The reality is that California is the sixthlargest economy in the world he said To write it off
