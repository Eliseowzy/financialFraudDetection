just checkin to see that my lil buddy in Portland isnt working himself too hard As you know I tried to call you tonight but then had to leave for a workout and a scrimmage soccer game I am so sore Its out of control Ok so down to the REAL reason Im writing Brendan and I had a great time at Happy Hour We talked a little about you but mostly about life in general He had mentioned that he had Emailed me so I rushed home to check it Basically he said all good things but there was one thing that struck me as odd I guess because he also brought the same point up at the restraunt He had written that although you thought I was cool and whatever you had commented on how strange the situation was and he sort of elaborated on that So the point of this Email is I guess to reassure you that I only have the best intentions towards you I am not trying to be your girlfriend or anything similar to that To tell you the truth I dont even know what your romantic situation is I just think you are an awesome guy whom Id love to become close friends with I am ecstatic that you are coming to visit me in Huntington Beach if you still are and Im thrilled that we can go sight seeing touring together I bragged and bragged to Brendan about what a great guy you were and then came home to feel like maybe you were taken back by my advances I really am just a very overly affectionate and loving person not to mention spontaneous I didnt mean to scare you away from having a great friendship with me and me with you For heavens sake you are my Portland connection and Im your beach bum buddy Honestly if I were a psycho I would have jumped at the chance to come up and see your condo when you offered I just think you are someone Id love to get to know Especially if you are anything like Brendan which best friends usually are he is such a sweetie When he and Meg go to visit her mom in LA they might just stop over for a visit and of course they are welcome to stay with me as well I guess I never asked if you had a girlfriend or someone in your life and to be quite honest I didnt even think to ask Brendan because its not important I want you Bill for your friendship and for your companionship now and when I move to Portland Reflecting back I realize that I may have written or said something that caught you off guard Its just my personality Im a huge flirt For heavens sake I was voted Most flirtatious my senior year not to mention Most likely to succeed Probably the second one due to the first but who knows Hahaha Im only teasing Ok seriously now Bill I want you to be honest If I did locating your condo etc or said like that was the most romantic thing I had ever read that was written by a guy something to upset you or give you a false impression I am so sorry I do find you attractive and perhaps if we lived in the same town or had met a little differently or for that matter I knew your romantic stiuation yeah I would have jumped at the chance to have dated you But we didnt and the truth is I can never have too many friends Especially good looking ones that I can introduce to all my girl friends so that they can be jealous with envy Like I said I only have the best of intentions towards you and towrds our relationship as friends But if you are uncomfortable with something Ive done or said I am so very sorry and all you have to do is tell me or Email me and youll never hear from me again Scouts honor I ve never been a scout but Im not know for my lies either Teehee I would love to hear any concerns that you might have in regards to our realtionship as friends If I can Ill put your mind at ease if not well I enjoyed our short minute interlude As always you are still welcome to come visit me and stay with me I would love to have the company If I dont hear form you within the next couple of weeks Ill assume the worst but still try to keep my schedule as flexible as possible in case you change your mind Im lucky in the fact that I can do that sort of thing Ok just Email me or call me Let me know that you are alive and kickin Ill be leaving for Calgary Canada this Thursday morning at am and will be there until the th Im so excited this is my first trip out of country but then again you know that So I guess Ill hear from you when I hear from you I just thought of a last possible reason I may be way off base here but I am not sure if you know the situation between my boyfriend and myself He is a real sweetheart and hes going to make a wonderful husband and father just not with me If you are concerned about our friendship and him becoming weird well the majority of my friends are guys and Todd is secure enough in himself that he doesnt care If this is about August and you staying with me my father is moving me down not him and it will be a long time until he can come to visit Also when I get there we are not going to continue a long distance exclusive relationship I havent dated or had much of a wild stage and I have told him that we will see other people Hes fine with that as well Ok I admit that his Potland stunt was a little irrational but hey I thought it was thoughtful and darling I love surprises and little extras I just didnt expect to have made plans and make myself look like the bad guy to someone whom Id never met Therefore I did everything in my power to rectify the situation and make both sides happy and in doing so caused this You think Im a psycho Not to mention I had to face Brendan and before he could read my Email you had already revealed the stroy to him SO I got to be embarrssed and a little humbled by the whole experience Ok thats it take it however you will but its am and Im exhausted I did the best I could to figure out and fix a possibly nonexisting problem I hope I did well enough to inspire a response from you Hope to hear or read from you soon Goodnight and God Bless Nikki Send a cool gift with your ECard giftcenter

even humid or misty I got screwed Ok it wasnt all that bad I actually had a really great time Imagine someone actually going on vacation to see it pour rain Sick sick individual Lets see the first day all we did was tour the city and allow lil miss Nikki to be a spy Portland was great no wonder you live in the middle of down town There were so many things to do and see Unfortunately because we didnt exactly have a good idea of where to go and so on and so forth we just wondered around aimlessly Then on Saturday we all drove to Astoriayou knew I just had to go It was great Absolutely beautiful On the way we stopped at the fresh berry market and had the most amazing berries Oh they were good Next we ate at a little fish place mmmmclam chowder and fried seafood Then went to Cannon Beach What a great little town I bought some pulled taffy and some hot chocolate and was in heaven Alot of the beach sites for example Haystack rock were in the Goonies film Then of course I found the little hotel that Kindergarten Cop was filmed in what a loser I was taking pictures like a fool Bill you dont understand for years and years every Saturday after cartoons I would pop KC into the VCR I loved it Ok ok dorky but hey you have to have some abnormalities in your life Then if you havent been here I am going to be the one to take you for your first timeif youll let me And hey dont get any wild hairs about exploring this before hand misterIm the tour guide on this baby Its outside of Cannon Beach just past Hug point Its a little trek called Falcon Cove you can reach the beach and it is the most beautiful hike we went on Finally we drove back into town and ate at the most discusting little dive downtown Bush Gardens Blech Horrible I felt like I had licked the hair on my dogs butt Oooo it was just gross Then of course I got to meet you That was a nice highlight to my trip You rate right up there along side the KC hotel rooms yeah I kinda like ya Next morning I ate the best breakfast of my entire life Not kidding Its something like the Otwalia Its in the Westin hotel Ok we all shared our plates so this was our breakfastsSarah got a fruit plate I got eggs benedict and Todd got pecan encrusted french toast with orange zing butter and syrup Swear to God that is the first place I want to go to eat when I get to go back Ok it was a little pricey though Not tooo bad it was for of us Not alot but breakfast is usually like bucks The next two days were spent in Hood River Cascade Lockes We hiked the Mananomah whatever falls the next day we rented bikes and rode them around the town of StevensWA miles I was really hurting by that night of the trail was up hill Oh my tail end hurt like crazy In Stevens we ate at a little snack shop It was probably one of the better places Oh what was its name Oh Little Vikings Really cute place Youve gotta go Oh one more that I wont recommendTugboat Annies in Hood River Again I felt like I had given an ATB to someone Too fancy Im a meat and potatoe girl That fancy stuff is nice sometimes but usually they just over do it WE ate at Stanfords the last day and it was another fancy place I ordered onion rings and they were good The salad was horrible So on a food rating scale POrtlandOregon recieves a I guess Im just not going to the right places As you can tell by the length of this I am at work and needing to use some of my time up You are the poor sap Ive chosen since you dont know me yet Well the move out date is set for me I move out on July Im not too sure when the townhouse will be available though so Im playing it by ear DO you have any idea when your trip out there might fall If you have a ball park idea that might be nice until you get concrete dates I just want to be sure that Im off of work as much as possible the day or days that you have elected to spend with me That is if you still want to spend them with me I mean I did sort of stalk your house and found out where you livedthat cant be good Ok I honestly and sincerely feel bad about that whole situation Im just sort of a small town girl who knows that those things really arent appropriate but do them regardless Youll understand once we become better friends I warned you a little though I did say that I was spontaneous and might just show up on your doorstep Well there you go I did Please dont tell Brendan You probably already did I actually need to Email him and tell him what a sweetheart he is for introducing me to you The small amount of time I got to spend with you was very nice I look forward to doing that again sometime Well just up hte time slot a hair Ok I will let your weary eyes seetle back to work Oh I did receive your voicemail on my phone but it was in NM I wouldnt have had time anyhow but thank you for your hospitality and the offer I cant wait to reciprocate it in CAli Take care Nikki Send a cool gift with your ECard giftcenter
