<32620342.1075858457902.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,tomas.valnek@enron.com,2001-04-18 08:54:00,Data for Moodys RiskCalc Cc From the initial work that I Ben and I have done data availability for the Moodys model is relatively good for European companies However there are problems for certain jurisdictions eg the Netherlands where reporting requirements are low Also all newly established entities with no accounts cannot be priced You may be aware that SP has a similar model You can find the description at wwwcreditmodelcom We met with SP earlier this morning and they will give us logins that I will forward to you I have not looked at the details but it appears to me that the Moodys model could be more relevant for our purposes as the SP model is calibrated of companies that SP has rated whereas Moodys has actually got data not only retsricted to the firms they rate Moreover the SP threshold USD m is very high For US counterparties there may be a problem as private US firms do not need to publish accounts In any case quality data is probably one of the most important issues to be resolved going ahead and this is likely to define what companies we will be able to price and influence model selection Therefore when you or someone else examines potential data sourcesvendors please keep Eric Kirkpatrick and Mike Mumford in the loop to ensure full coordination Regards TV Forwarded by Tomas ValnekLONECT on Ben Parsons To Tomas CT cc Subject Data for Moodys RiskCalc FYI Forwarded by Ben ParsonsLONECT on From Iris nronXgate on CDT To Craig CT Kim nronXgate cc Amitava NRON Vasant nronXgate Vince J CT Ben CT Mike CT Scott nron Subject Data for Moodys RiskCalc Craig and Kim As you know I have obtained a day trial subscription to Moodys RiskCalc You wanted to know if it makes sense for Enron to purchase RiskCalc Well after plowing through their page manual and sitting through todays hour Moodys presentation it is necessary for us to have information about Enrons counterparties to move to the next step with RiskCalc We have obtained some information on Enrons European counterparties from our colleagues in the London office We need for you andor your colleagues in the Houston office to supply us with a list of Enrons North American counterparties More specifically to evaluate Moodys RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enrons North American private firm counterparties Fiscal Year The prior twelve months of financial data are represented Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables such as cost of goods sold net income sales and EBIT The value should be a fourdigit integer year without mention of the day or month such as or Forecasts until the year can be made A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last years inflation level In general this estimation error will not cause any great problems as size affects default rates at very large scales eg vs makes a significant difference vs does not Cash Equivalents This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities Inventory Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet in thousands dollars without any alterations for accounting method eg LIFO FIFO Average Cost This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue Specifically this would include purchase cost sales cost sales taxes transportation costs insurance costs and storage costs Current Assets This item primarily represents cash inventories accounts receivables marketable securities and other current assets Total Assets Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars For example should be entered as Specifically total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property plant and equipment plus other noncurrent assets including intangible assets deferred items and investments and advances Leave previous years total assets blank for Australian companies Current Liabilities Liabilities are positive values Included in current liabilities are shortterm debt accounts payable and other current liabilities Total Liabilities This balance sheet account total liabilities is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus longterm debt plus other noncurrent liabilities including deferred taxes investment tax credit and minority interest Retained Earnings Retained Earnings a historical measure of performance is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders Typically it is the prior years retained earnings plus net income less distributions Retained earnings are generally positive Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings Leave this field blank for Australian companies Sales This item consists of the industry segments gross sales the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period reduced by cash discounts trade discounts and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers Cost of Goods Sold Entered in thousands of dollars this value is generally a positive number less than sales It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production such as material labor and overhead Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling General and Administrative Expenses Leave this field blank for Australian companies EBIT Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income Interest Expense This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short and longterm debt Typically we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities One measure of computing this is Interest Expense total liabilities Net Income This item represents the income or loss reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations A loss is represented by a negative sign For example a loss would be entered as Leave previous years net income blank for Australian companies Extraordinary Items Positive or negative this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations These items include extraordinary gainslosses income loss from discontinued operations and cumulative affect of accounting changes Expenses are entered as negative values gains as positive values Leave previous years extraordinary items blank for Australian companies Country This model is calibrated for the United States Canada and Australia We look forward to receiving this information for Enrons private firm North American counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of RiskCalc Thanks Iris
