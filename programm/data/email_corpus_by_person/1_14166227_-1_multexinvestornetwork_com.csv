insights B is for bubble Supply chain software stocks surgebut why By Dave Sterman equity research columnist Its dj vu all over again as stocks of supply chain software vendors i Technologies ITWO Manugistics MANU and SAP SAP among others have climbed sharply in recent months These stocks were among the highest flyers at the height of the Internet bubble and its fair to wonder if investors are slipping back into that old bugaboo irrational exuberance The surge in prices is based on a fairly dubious investment thesis sales are no longer falling and the worst may be over But sales are not yet rising either And analysts are compelled to look several years out to justify current stock prices Make no mistakesupply chain software is an essential part of corporate IT strategy Companies are

too much from the broad market Today investors are understandably concerned about the market and are leery of chasing stocks However there will be a time during the year when youve just missed the boat as most missed it last year And Im just as sure that something will test the resolve of the marketan event or series of events that will send stocks tumbling However I think it is a big mistake for investors to wait for it or to wait for some type of testing of the bottom By the same token however I think it is still important to take profits and maybe be a little more flexible with stops I suspect that after two years of depression this market will still suffer from bouts of mental instability Let those bipolar moments work for you There are tons of funds on the sidelines waiting to chase this market Keep a steady head dont panic and stop worrying about the worse case scenarios Fundamental change cannot happen until we see a change of mind among investors Below are my thoughts on
