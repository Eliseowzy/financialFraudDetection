benefit for transferring or holding the shares in a Cayman entity I propose that EBPH XII obtain the two certificates and then distribute those certificates to Enron South America LLC the sole shareholder of EBPH XII The value of the certificates at the date of transfer will determine the US tax treatment Given the liquidity discount surrounding the stock using the screen price on the date of the transaction is probably not a good indicator of the fair market value For tax purposes we will assume the value to be the historical cost basis since recent trades have been in a narrow band on either side of that value If the first M certificate is sold shortly after the transfer to Enron South America LLC we will need to adjust the transfer price since the sales price to a third party will be a valid indicator of what the fair market value was on the date of the distribution If the ultimate transfer price is higher than the tax basis EBPHXII will recognize taxable income and pay US tax on the gain in the year the distribution was made to Enron South America LLC This would result in reporting a tax expense in and perhaps book income in if that sale takes place after the end of the year If the value on the date of the transfer is ultimately determined to be less than the historical tax basis the distribution to Enron South America LLC will result in there being unrecovered basis in EBPH XII If the shares are sold by EBPH XII to affiliated Cayman companies the same valuation issues exist with the same potential for recognition of US gain on the sale from EBPH XII to an

Kimberly Original Message From Daborn Robert mailto Sent Tuesday September PM To Hopley Kimberly Subject RE ECT Invesmtents Inc Kimberly Further to our conversation of earlier today it would appear that trades have been incorrectly allocated to an existing Enron account This existing account has been opened with CSFB for several years and it may well be the case that it is the correct entity for certain transactions between our two corporations However I note that for transactions executed by yourself the correct booking entity should be ETC Investments Inc ETC Whilst ETC is an existing client of CSFB Corporation NY it is not currently set up as a client of CSFB Equities CSFB Europe Ltd In order that your account can be set up and trades booked correctly I would appreciate it if you could provide CSFB with following information Confirmation that ETC is a wholly majority owned subsidiary of Enron Corp This can be evidenced by providing CSFB with a copy of Enrons Annual Report Audited Financial Statement and Accounts or confirmed in writing by Enron on Enron letterhead Confirmation of the registered address of ETC Completed and signed authorisation document attached below

no US tax benefit for transferring or holding the shares in a Cayman entity I propose that EBPH XII obtain the two certificates and then distribute those certificates to Enron South America LLC the sole shareholder of EBPH XII The value of the certificates at the date of transfer will determine the US tax treatment Given the liquidity discount surrounding the stock using the screen price on the date of the transaction is probably not a good indicator of the fair market value For tax purposes we will assume the value to be the historical cost basis since recent trades have been in a narrow band on either side of that value If the first M certificate is sold shortly after the transfer to Enron South America LLC we will need to adjust the transfer price since the sales price to a third party will be a valid indicator of what the fair market value was on the date of the distribution If the ultimate transfer price is higher than the tax basis EBPHXII will recognize taxable income and pay US tax on the gain in the year the distribution was made to Enron South America LLC This would result in reporting a tax expense in and perhaps book income in if that sale takes place after the end of the year If the value on the date of the transfer is ultimately determined to be less than the historical tax basis the distribution to Enron South America LLC will result in there being unrecovered basis in EBPH XII If the shares are sold by EBPH XII to affiliated Cayman companies the same valuation issues exist with the same potential for recognition of US gain on the sale from EBPH

otherwise transfer capital split the two M tranches to this NewCo This needs to happen next week Pending Dan Boyles structuring efforts and an affirmative Corp decision supervised by Joe Kishkill the
