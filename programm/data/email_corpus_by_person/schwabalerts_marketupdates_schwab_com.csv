from its traditional Ltryptophan stupor amid very little corporate or economic news The National Bureau of Economic Research may declare the US economy is in a recession but there is a silver lining Oil and oilrelated shares fell overnight as Russia continues to rebuff OPEC overtures driving European bourses lower According to The Wall Street Journal the NBER is meeting today and may declare that the longest US economic expansion since World War II ended in March when employment figures signaled that a recession may have begun While a general rule of thumb for defining a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative Gross Domestic Product growth the NBER defines a recession in a more subjective manner utilizing key economic indicators If a recession did indeed start in March that could actually be a positive development that is if history is any guide Of course there are no guarantees that the economy will stick to historical norms but the average recession since WWII lasted for about months with the longest slump spanning months That could mean that a recovery is just around the corner Few economic indicators point to this scenario at this time nor do earnings forecasts but Ned Davis research shows that the markets have historically bottomed during a recession roughly five months before the economy and about ten months ahead of an earnings recovery And there is a lot of monetary and fiscal stimulus in the pipeline to support a recovery soon So cheer up the malls are opening early today TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY Prices across the yield curve rose in early trading as Treasuries remain volatile following last weeks wild ride and oil prices fell overnight Oil prices were higher earlier after Norway agreed to cut oil production succumbing to OPEC pressure

against the yen Yen strength has been fueled by the unwinding of so called yen carry trades which is when investors buy back yen that had been borrowed at a zero interest rate The borrowed yen was
