fine tune my skills in the time remaining must go to class but will write more later hate to say it but you prob will be saddled w a care package for me from mom will try to make it in the lbs or less range e From To Subject We have closure well sortof Date Thu Sep Im soooo good The chosen path was cool indifference So last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a really good showing I got there about with Nick and the groups size swelled to about by About I saw Kevin Teds pal the one you meet a steak night wandering around LWs obviously in search of someone Can you believe it He Ted knew I had organized this gathering I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and overheard Darren encouraging Teds attendance mind you Ted was not in the email distribution and he had the nerve to come Anyway Kevin saw me and came over to chat He informed me that our friend Ted should be there shortly to which I responded You would know better than me at this point The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms bad terms etc I said there really werent any terms I just hadnt heard a peep out of him for about weeks Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Teds head and cause a big scene When I said no I think he was genuinely disappointed I said in order for me to do something like that I would have to care about the loss and that while a week or two earlier I might have cared a bit more with each passing day the loss seems less and less like much of a loss Kevin told me I was betteroff without Ted To go even further he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of his date Ted nor any of his girlfriends He said that while he thought Ted was a great guy ie fun to be around good stories etc he wasnt good dating material I agreed with Kevin saying Ted is a great guy he just makes a lousy man dont you like that one I then went on to say Anyway Im destined for bigger and better things right Kevin Much bigger and much better About this time my parents showed upthe plot thickens I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about The two of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when dumdadumdum Ted shows up He approaches our group because he sees Kevin and is forced to make eyecontact with me I give him a hey and he gives me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant hows it going He asked what Kevin and my Dad were talking about I told him the Navy he said dont get Kevin started or youll never shut him upThen he walked away He never acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the evening The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with my group for quite a while before going to join Ted My parents and I ate our steaks right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table when we were finished It really was a great night I would almost say I was glowing I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it wasnt a show for Teds benefitI really was having a great time So when my parents decide to head out they walked over to TedKevins table to say goodbye to Kevin It was awesome Teds sitting right next to Kevin while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in his chair Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents he couldnt even make eyecontact I ended up staying there for at least another hour and then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House Needless to say I was very hung over today Anyway theres the storyHes a complete and utter asshole So Im done And no there is no way he could weasel his way back in to my good graces Now on to a fun subject my trip to London I bought my ticket today I think I got hosed a little bit but it was the cheapest ticket I could find before taxes I will arrive at Heathrow airport around am Friday the th and depart about am on Tuesday the th Im very excited about the trip I really need to get out of Houston I leave the activities in your capable hands bear in mind I will have to see Darren and Nick at some point Single again Sue Get Your Private Free Email from MSN Hotmail at Share information about yourself create

only have aol messenger i think and after all the dissertationinduced computer trauma this last moth installing it could prove to be the proverbial straw you knowgood to hear about chuck sr was worried about him when i heard about the missing planes am sure both chucks will be ok gals enron was spared as well but what an ordeal geez makes becoming a carpenter and living in NB look reaaaaaly attractive right about now city schmitty a beer out on the deck rt now would be super cathrtic i think i know yall arent getting all the graphic footage there that we are here of the middle eastern countries parades and parties in the streets rt now so unreal and sickening how can people be that evil really sad you know michael loud london michael turns out he just flew back here from a meeting mon morning at the WTC and his entire US office of cantor fitzgerald was based on the top stories of the WTC no one has been heard from terrifying its just so isolated and lonely here rt now want to be home so badly and i get so funky in these kinds of situations you know ultra sentimental and nostalgic and weepy and matt didnt help he did one of those im so worried that our friendsfamily dont know how loved and appreciated they are bits and thats one of those deeprooted fears that you just never want to deal with because we count on lisa to be the hallmark aspect of our grp and no one else i chalk it up to a frightening lack of estrogen amongst us alleither way not something i want to start thinking about bc its just opening pandoras box and cant stop still hoping to make it home on fri or sat and matt said hes going to houston on fri for a business thing so maybe we will all get to chill this weekend if the stars are alligned have fingers crossed ok bk to the bbc and cking on flight

Files or Folders and type in Yahoo Messenger If you still have it on your computer it will show up in the search area and you can just double click on itthat should bring it up Im doing alright And you hit the nail on the head with the Josh commentthats exactly what Ive been reminded of That feeling of uncertaintyloss of youthful bravado sadness injured sense of securityall of it Everyone in the Scott household is fine Dad actually flew over NY yesterday morning before the first plane hit He was coming from Manchester NH He said is was an absolutely beautiful day and that they flew right over Central Parkno idea how dramatically that skyline would change The first they heard of the events that they must have just missed was when they landed in Nashville Hes still in Nashville right now obviously but hes okay and thats whats important Im hoping with the limited flights theyre allowing that Dad will be able to make it back to Houston soon but it appears the FAAs just trying to get the passengers who are stranded back home so he may just be stuck somewhere else as a result Chuck and Chris were supposed to fly out tomorrow morning from Seoul but they too have been delayed indefinitely The Army has put a hold on all duty station transfers which means we have no idea when theyll be leaving Korea or where exactly Chuck will be going The stories and connections of the people on the news and those around me is horrifying and deeply saddening A large number of people we do business with are based in NY and have lost countless friends and colleagues in the WTCs destruction Chuck has some pledge brothers who are working up there but weve heard that both of them are okay I wish you were back home as wellI was on the phone with my Mom off and on all day yesterday and I must say it wouldve been nice to been back home on the couch with her I did talk to Jen yesterday worried about LA and what was going on there but she was fine as well She said theyd shut down the airport and several major roads surrounding it but nothing else of concern We evacuated the Enron building around yesterday morningit was disconcerting I walked down the flights of stairs to get to my parking garage and had only one desireto get out of downtown There were rumors flying that Houston was another target and given the size of our building our international presence esp in regards to oilnatural gas and our CEOs connections to the PresidentI think everyone figured Enron would be a logical target Fortunately those fears were unfounded On a lighter noteIm very

America the never marrieds In less than years the number of nevermarrieds has more than doubled apparently pushing back the median age of marriage to the oldest it has been in our countrys history about years for women and for men As if the connotation of never married werent negative enough the vilification of our group has been swift and shrill These statistics prove a titanic loss of family values according to The Washington Times An article in Time magazine asked whether picky women were denying themselves and society the benefits of marriage and in the process kicking off an outbreak of Sex and the City promiscuity In a study on marriage conducted at Rutgers University researchers say the social glue of the family is at stake adding ominously that crime rates are highly correlated with a large percentage of unmarried young males Although I never planned it I can tell you how I became a nevermarried Thirteen years ago I moved to San Francisco for what I assumed was a brief transition period between college and marriage The problem was I wasnt just looking for an appropriate spouse To use the language of the Rutgers researchers I was soulmate searching Like percent of nevermarrieds from to I too agree with the statement When you marry you want your spouse to be your soul mate first and foremost This berromantic view is something new In a survey fully three out of four college women said theyd marry a man they didnt love if he fit their criteria in every other way I discovered along with my friends that finding that soul mate wasnt easy Girlfriends came and went as did jobs and apartments The constant in my life by default not by plan became a loose group of friends After a few years that groups membership and routines began to solidify We met weekly for dinner at a neighborhood restaurant We traveled together moved one anothers furniture painted one anothers apartments cheered one another on at sporting events and openmike nights One day I discovered that the transition period I thought I was living wasnt a transition period at all Something real and important had grown there I belonged to an urban tribe I use the word tribe quite literally here this is a tight group with unspoken roles and hierarchies whose members think of each other as us and the rest of the world as them This bond is clearest in times of trouble After earthquakes or the recent terrorist strikes my instinct to huddle with and protect my group is no different from what Id feel for my family Once I identified this in my own life I began to see tribes everywhere I looked a house of exsorority women in Philadelphia a team of ultimatefrisbee players in Boston and groups of musicians in Austin Tex Cities Ive come to believe arent emotional wastelands where fragile individuals with arrested development mope around selfindulgently searching for true love There are rich landscapes filled with urban tribes So what does it mean that weve quietly added the tribe years as a developmental stage to adulthood Because our friends in the tribe hold us responsible for our actions I doubt it will mean a wild swing toward promiscuity or crime Tribal behavior does not prove a loss of family values It is a fresh expression of them It is true though that marriage and the tribe are at odds As many exgirlfriends will ruefully tell you loyalty to the tribe can wreak havoc on romantic relationships Not surprisingly marriage usually signals the beginning of the end of tribal membership From inside the group marriage can seem like a risky gambit When members of our tribe choose to get married the rest of us talk about them with grave concern as if theyve joined a religion that requires them to live in a guarded compound But we also know that the urban tribe cant exist forever Those of us who have entered our mids find ourselves feeling vaguely as if were living in the latter episodes of Seinfeld or Friends as if the plot lines of our lives have begun to wear thin So although tribe membership may delay marriage that is where most of us are still heading And it turns out there may be some good news when we get there Divorce rates have leveled off Tim Heaton a sociologist at Brigham Young University says he believes he knows why In a paper to be published next year he argues that it is because people are getting married later Could it be that we who have been biding our time in happy tribes are now actually grown up enough to understand what we need in a mate What a fantastic twist we never marrieds may end up revitalizing the very institution weve supposedly been undermining And theres another dynamic worth considering Those of us who find it so hard to leave our tribes will not choose marriage blithely as if it is the inevitable next step in our lives the way middleclass highschool kids choose college When we go to the altar we will be sacrificing something precious In that sacrifice we may begin to learn to treat our marriages with the reverence they need to survive Ethan Watters is a writer living in San Francisco Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at intlasp

sound a bit inspired about the possibility of doing some buying work in the silver dept which would involve trips to the orient all this is second hand of course was severly hung over when niki talked to her on sun after the party i was a shameful girl sat night although i inflicted damage on no one but myself had mini pmsinduced temper tantrumselfpity party at the bar w niki her friend nima and wenus then wandered off to catch the night bus at trafalger squareneedless to say was so drunk i passed out on the bus and slept waaaaaaay past my stop ending up somewhere in acton the equiv of living in lakewood then waking up in hempstead had pounds to my name no money on houston acct to pulse out and at am not too many cabs haunting the gangster area of actonwas a pitiful scene had to bribe a mini cab to drop me off as close to ladbrok grove as pounds would take me then hobbled home about miles in heels whiney and drunk very sad no matter am almost done w dreaded paper well maybe it is time for susan to explore new territories am pretty damn sure there are other alternatives to enron in the seattle area that offer job description close to what youre doing or want to do enron is not the only game in town and shouldnt hold you back from having new experineces or making inspired decisions could warrant some research keep me posted back to smae old same oldchat soon will try to call

have a feeling shes actually going to really like being there and working I pretty sure the folks are still helping out with living expenses etc so she wont have to make too big of an adjustment right off the bat As for me Seattle could definitely be a destination but it would require a job change Enron doesnt have any offices up there The closest office is Portland and for obvious and now unavoidable reasons I dont see a move there any time soon You are right about not being able to go wrong with a place possessing Austinlike qualitiesthey are highly desirable I will most certainly try to keep the September date openit would be great to see Britney and Arden We had Susan Es bachelorette party Saturday night plus a bridal shower earlier that day Lisa hosted Laura Whites at the apartment the same night I got to see and visit with Jenny Kenair sp Janie Pitman Rachel Pack among others Very interesting The two bachelorette parties met up at Black Swan for late night dancing Lis was in rare form I knew it was bad when she ran up and started hugging meI think she almost crushed Susan and Kelly Anyway it was actually pretty fun and Ive decided I really like Susans sister Betsygood sense of humor and not at all beboppy I did manage to trick her into doing the VICTORY cheer at Black Swan though I thought it was pretty darn funny myselfshe was mortified when she realized Id got her to do a cheer Once againbest of luck banging out your opus Talk to you soon Sue If youre looking to procrastinate a little this evening you can give me a buzz on my cell Id try calling pm

<5427506.1075858931037.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ehillegeist@hotmail.com,2001-08-04 03:28:56,one of those patriotic things Why are Aggies the shame of Texas Well I am probably not the best person to go into this I can assure you my brother and other Horns who have had the torture of spending time in College Station can tell it better than I but here are my takes on the subject They wont shut up They have to go on about spirit and dogs and old army and red ass and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat UT and blah bah blah Shut up You start to get the feeling their entire school was built to spite UT Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the s passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main school University of Texas that would teach agriculture and mechanics Ags love to say their school is older from where they get that I dont knowthe fact is the State intended am to be a branch of UT They are like afterbirth from the original creation Like Danny Devito in Twins So they apparently have this complex so much so that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good All the while nobody at UT denies that AM is a good school yet they wont shut up So they write a fight song about Texas and how they want to beat us They have a Fish camp for Freshman where they tell them how bad Texas is and how good AM and all its traditions are It is the worlds longest known case of penis envy and it is manifest in everything AM does The people at AM Now we all have friends who went to AM or are at AM There are some nice people there Howeverthere is the Corp East Texas answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere For every boyscout who never learned to stop playing with his GI Joe toys there is the Corp Now forget the fact that AM will actually let people with subpar grades enroll if they agree to join the Corp Forget the fact that the Corp looked like a gestapo hate rally when beating down students including one instance of tackling and punching a young girl on Kyle Field in Forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that have been filed against them and swept under the rug over the years they just this past month have had one Corp member bring charges against another Corp member who apparently had been propositioning others for a little mutual Sodomy Not only could I go on with more instances of idiocy by these Khaki clad shaven headed dorks I am sure each of you have your own stories The point is We all respect West Point Anapolis The Air Force Academy Nobody respects the Corp I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world Just because you dress like the Army and try and act like the Army does not make you the Army People at AM dont even like these clowns It is not cool to shave your head and dress up Halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year If you want to carry guns and beat up civilians move to Israel It is even less cool to slobber on somebodys daughter on national television and call it a tradition Dry humping year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool Not only is it not cool it should be against the law I know that in College Station students are prone to just mount each other on the campus lawn or in the middle of class or any time anything good happens you can just grab the girl next to you and start sucking on her face But everywhere else in the world it is looked down upon Especially if you are doing it on my TV That is why we had to move the game from Thanksgiving Because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game some boys scout is tongue thrashing some overweight coed during somebodys thanksgiving dinner We do not need to see burly women engaged in a suck fest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board Some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique counter Screw that forget makeup it is too late for that just give them a veil I have only dated one aggie in my lifetime She was a cute girl too But our relationship albeit doomed from the start was cut short when she ripped butt in my presence on a date I am willing to look past many shortcomings in a woman but do not expect to drop ass in my bedroom no less and expect not to get run There will be no blasting of foul air by my future wife At least not until we are engaged Come on Is that common in College Station Do ags sit around on dates just trading glandular salutes Hey Betty FARRRT Can you top that Sure Bill GGGRRUUUNNTTTT put that in your pipe and smoke it Truly Gross Is that what ags mean by Red Ass and Old Army She sure laid some Old Army that night TU is not funny It is not insulting It is just dumb Just imagine Ags if folks from Texas kept talking about MA and giggling That would not be funny In fact it would be retarded Thats why we dont do it Please learn You want to lose the image of country bumpkins of a people fond of sheep of people that arent stupid Then quit building things that fall down Quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national television Quit whooping in church Quit whooping period Quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals Quit spending your Friday nights practicing how to yell Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when youre running for Governor When you are filling out your season ticket renewals and the form asks for your Phone H W Quit putting Height weight Just collectively stop making asses of yourselves Go to East Texas tour every small town and ask every red neck with a th grade education why they cheer for AM and wear maroon That is your fan base This is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid Nobody cares if you think your band is better They might be louder they might march in neat little zig zags but they have no musical ability But the point is nobody cares who wins halftime Quit getting geeked up about marching bands I find it hard to believe you stood through your high school bands entire halftime performance And why Cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now Plus you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care Why is it cool all of a sudden now that youre in college Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds Perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe Oh waitI understand now Dogs are not ladies They dont look or smell like ladies Dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly Finally College Station is an armpit of a town Quit pretending that it is a great college town It is a town and there is a college there That should be the end of this comparison If you feel that life doesnt get any better than the Dixie Chicken and enjoy being stuck in a never ending Dukes Of Hazard episode then move there More importantly dont move to Austinwe are trying to create an educated technological and open minded population base Austin is and will continue to be the birthplace and final resting place of
