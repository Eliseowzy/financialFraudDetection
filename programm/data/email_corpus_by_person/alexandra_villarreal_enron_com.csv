Issues As you all know our move is scheduled for this weekend Hopefully you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information Voicemail instructions Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by PM Friday All saved messages greetings and recorded names will be saved If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isnt on Building access ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at AM Due to the gas and power moves being combined it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POCs to come in on Sunday to unpack Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications NOTE Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday o Monday AM for all employees Security badges All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted please contact Carli Smith Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times No one will be allowed access without their badge If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the nd floor and the skyring Move team colors As mentioned at the move meeting the following is a list of the color designations vests for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in o Red Move Team o Orange Desktop SupportIT o Green Telephony Newspaper subscriptions The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS nd floor corridor It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN contact Sunny Rodgers Move boxes Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about boxes per person You may call Facilities if you need to request additional boxes Move labels If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels please call Carli Smith to have additional or missing labels printed Laptops Important Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by PM on Friday If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled Bottled water Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water The large bottles of water gallon will not be allowed on the floor We would also like to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations Phone sets Although most of you are aware of this we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk either a turret or an Avaya but not both Do not tag your phones a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have but if I have missed something please let me know Thanks so much for all your help and hard work
