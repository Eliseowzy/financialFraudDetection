travel is arduous at best but some planning and mental programming can save your sanity Our OneTravelcom Experts Nancy Zebrick and Bob Jones offer some tips and general advice which we hope will help you pass through your gates in great physical and mental shape Statistically speaking airplane travel is the safest way to get from one point on the globe to another Yet some travelers still step onto the plane with fear It may not be easy to overcome this trepidation but as Nancy explains its best not to selfmedicate with inflight cocktails Alcohol triples its effect in flight and causes serious dehydration says Nancy Skip it and drink lots of water ounces for a long hour flight is not unusual Try to keep to your normal eating schedule while in flight and bear in mind these rules of thumb Highfiber carbohydrates seem to have better effect than fats and even protein in keeping the amount of air that is produced through digestion to a minimum Fruit and yogurt are good sources of carbohydrates and vitamins consider packing some for the first leg of your flight Eat small portions to ensure proper digestion Avoid salty foods They can bloat you and cause your feet to swell Forget carbonated beverages the gas expands at high altitude Fruit and vegetable juices are better alternatives Also avoid tea and coffee as they are both diuretics and can dehydrate you even more Always bring a bottle of water with you The airline may run out Once you reach your arrival city adjust your eating schedule a bit to comply with the time change Anytime you sit in one place for over an hour especially at high altitude your body experiences problems You may notice swelling in your lower legs and feet as your circulation is reduced Veteran flyer Bob Jones offers tips to solve your inflight woes Try the twostep method First wear support hose on long flights and second step Step out of your seat and walk the aisles If you cannot get up and move about do your best to stretch and move your legs as much as possible For those in the over group it is also very important to move the rest of your body Simple shoulder shrugs and neck rotation along with arm and back stretching will do wonders for your wellbeing Some basic isometrics or just shifting your position in your seat helps Bottom line is this if you sit still for three or four hours it will take its toll as you get up to leave the airplane Stretch before during and after the trip Elevate your feet if you can Hydrate your skin with lotions and moisturizers to prevent dryness says Nancy The best time to apply moisturizer is when there is still moisture in your pores so start before you board And try to wear larger more comfortable shoes at the airport and inflight Because of the altitude gas in the body will cause slight swelling If you are traveling with kids as Bob often does remember that they need to move too as well as be occupied during the flight Kids tend to be able to sleep on long flights since they can curl right up and go to sleep in a coach seat And Bob says since they are more rested than you try not to be too short with them Always bring activities and order special Kids Meals which are now available on virtually all carriers Activities should be age appropriate and if you are bringing electronic games make sure they are quiet or that the sound can be turned off Be sure to include manual activities like coloring connectthedots and word finders And finally even though the world is shrinking remember to bring a favorite snack for the outbound and return trip Your kids favorite snack may be hard to find in another state or country Congratulations You have managed to control your mental and physiological stress between the gates and your kids are happy too Happy Holidays and Happy

TALK Holiday tips from the OneTravelcom Experts Holiday travel is arduous at best but some planning and mental programming can save your sanity By now you have your tickets for Thanksgiving travel unless you are going to travel on Thanksgiving Day and should be booking soon if you are traveling over the Hanukkah Christmas or New Years holidays This done consider the following tips as your travel travails begin We all agree th at the easiest way to make holiday travel better is to be flexible and keep a positive mental attitude While the latter may be hard at times just step back and take a deep breath Confrontation will only make things get worse You can always be right later Packing and preshipping ideas With a bit of planning you can travel with just one wheeled carryon and a small carryon bag for an overnighter or a twoweek trip No lost luggage no misrouted or stolen bags And if you miss a connection you can rebook and hop on another plane with all of your baggage in tow For extra comfort replace your shoulder bag strap with a padded golf bag strap or consider using a backpack with two straps to balance the weight evenly Feet can suffer during travel so make sure to wear your most comfortable shoes to t he airport Visualize your luggage as a box full of air all you need to do is fill up the air spaces in the most compressed manner Rolling or folding and overlapping clothes works best Place socks and underwear into shoes and fill every available space Miniaturize your toiletries by pouring small amounts of shampoos lotions and other necessities into reusable plastic travel bottles you can pack these in a fraction of the space Pack only wardrobe essentials Plan to dress in neutrals tans grays blacks wit h some white or accent color for versatility and saved space Pack with plastic bags to keep clothes from wrinkling If you are taking Christmas gifts or a special Thanksgiving dinner treat consider UPS Airborne FedEx and the like The items will arrive ahead of you and theres no chance of them being crushed in the overhead bin by someone who doesnt know whats inside If kids are part of your entourage make sure that they pack their own smal l bag of carryon toys and games to keep them occupied Pack snacks and a surprise in your carryon for them as well When traveling with children travel early with your longest leg over their nap time The white noise of the plane train or family car will lull them to sleep and give you a chanc e to catch your breath as well Most airlines have increased their charges for pets in the cabin and baggag e hold It may cost you between and to take your pet along for the holidays Consider a kennel stay or have a neighbor care for your pet whi le you are gone Travel especially by air can be very traumatic for your pe t Getting to the airport or train Strongly consider public transportation such as a taxi or an airport shuttle If a friend owes you a favor now is the time to cash it in The airport lots will be full and if you dont allow enough time you may pani c while you circle the lot looking for a spot At the airport The Air Transport Association is expecting record numbers of travelers this Thanksgiving holiday Even with these numbers there are things you can do to help make your trip as hasslefree as possible Plan to arrive at the airport at least two hours before your scheduled departure Leave for the airport early enough to allow extra time for increased airport traffic parking trouble and longer luggage checkin and security screening lines With most airfares you can stand by for an earlier or later sameday flight so if you are at the airport early there is always a chance you can get out of town on an earlier flight Note If y ou do not have advance seat assignments you may want to arrive at the airport even earlier Make sure all baggage has your name on the outside If you do not have a baggage identification tag the airline will provide you with one Have your photo identification ready for the agent at checkin Although most airline rules read that they may cancel your reservation if y ou are not at the departure gate ready to board at least minutes before departure dont press your luck Plan to be at the departure gate read y to board at least minutes before departure When it is time to board board The plane may not move until everyone is seated and all carryon baggage is stowed Keep it simple Board the plane stow your stuff sit down and buckle your seat belt Although the airlines tell us that it is not necessary to reconfirm return domestic flights we do and we recommend you do too As soon as you arriv e at your destination contact the airline to reconfirm your return flight an d leave a phone number where you can be reached Next week Tips for

TALK Holiday tips from the OneTravelcom Experts Holiday travel is arduous at best but some planning and mental programming can save your sanity By now you have your tickets for Thanksgiving travel unless you are going to travel on Thanksgiving Day and should be booking soon if you are traveling over the Hanukkah Christmas or New Years holidays This done consider the following tips as your travel travails begin We all agree th at the easiest way to make holiday travel better is to be flexible and keep a positive mental attitude While the latter may be hard at times just step back and take a deep breath Confrontation will only make things get worse You can always be right later Packing and preshipping ideas With a bit of planning you can travel with just one wheeled carryon and a small carryon bag for an overnighter or a twoweek trip No lost luggage no misrouted or stolen bags And if you miss a connection you can rebook and hop on another plane with all of your baggage in tow For extra comfort replace your shoulder bag strap with a padded golf bag strap or consider using a backpack with two straps to balance the weight evenly Feet can suffer during travel so make sure to wear your most comfortable shoes to t he airport Visualize your luggage as a box full of air all you need to do is fill up the air spaces in the most compressed manner Rolling or folding and overlapping clothes works best Place socks and underwear into shoes and fill every available space Miniaturize your toiletries by pouring small amounts of shampoos lotions and other necessities into reusable plastic travel bottles you can pack these in a fraction of the space Pack only wardrobe essentials Plan to dress in neutrals tans grays blacks wit h some white or accent color for versatility and saved space Pack with plastic bags to keep clothes from wrinkling If you are taking Christmas gifts or a special Thanksgiving dinner treat consider UPS Airborne FedEx and the like The items will arrive ahead of you and theres no chance of them being crushed in the overhead bin by someone who doesnt know whats inside If kids are part of your entourage make sure that they pack their own smal l bag of carryon toys and games to keep them occupied Pack snacks and a surprise in your carryon for them as well When traveling with children travel early with your longest leg over their nap time The white noise of the plane train or family car will lull them to sleep and give you a chanc e to catch your breath as well Most airlines have increased their charges for pets in the cabin and baggag e hold It may cost you between and to take your pet along for the holidays Consider a kennel stay or have a neighbor care for your pet whi le you are gone Travel especially by air can be very traumatic for your pe t Getting to the airport or train Strongly consider public transportation such as a taxi or an airport shuttle If a friend owes you a favor now is the time to cash it in The airport lots will be full and if you dont allow enough time you may pani c while you circle the lot looking for a spot At the airport The Air Transport Association is expecting record numbers of travelers this Thanksgiving holiday Even with these numbers there are things you can do to help make your trip as hasslefree as possible Plan to arrive at the airport at least two hours before your scheduled departure Leave for the airport early enough to allow extra time for increased airport traffic parking trouble and longer luggage checkin and security screening lines With most airfares you can stand by for an earlier or later sameday flight so if you are at the airport early there is always a chance you can get out of town on an earlier flight Note If y ou do not have advance seat assignments you may want to arrive at the airport even earlier Make sure all baggage has your name on the outside If you do not have a baggage identification tag the airline will provide you with one Have your photo identification ready for the agent at checkin Although most airline rules read that they may cancel your reservation if y ou are not at the departure gate ready to board at least minutes before departure dont press your luck Plan to be at the departure gate read y to board at least minutes before departure When it is time to board board The plane may not move until everyone is seated and all carryon baggage is stowed Keep it simple Board the plane stow your stuff sit down and buckle your seat belt Although the airlines tell us that it is not necessary to reconfirm return domestic flights we do and we recommend you do too As soon as you arriv e at your destination contact the airline to reconfirm your return flight an d leave a phone number where you can be reached Next week Tips for

travel is arduous at best but some planning and mental programming can save your sanity Our OneTravelcom Experts Nancy Zebrick and Bob Jones offer some tips and general advice which we hope will help you pass through your gates in great physical and mental shape Statistically speaking airplane travel is the safest way to get from one point on the globe to another Yet some travelers still step onto the plane with fear It may not be easy to overcome this trepidation but as Nancy explains its best not to selfmedicate with inflight cocktails Alcohol triples its effect in flight and causes serious dehydration says Nancy Skip it and drink lots of water ounces for a long hour flight is not unusual Try to keep to your normal eating schedule while in flight and bear in mind these rules of thumb Highfiber carbohydrates seem to have better effect than fats and even protein in keeping the amount of air that is produced through digestion to a minimum Fruit and yogurt are good sources of carbohydrates and vitamins consider packing some for the first leg of your flight Eat small portions to ensure proper digestion Avoid salty foods They can bloat you and cause your feet to swell Forget carbonated beverages the gas expands at high altitude Fruit and vegetable juices are better alternatives Also avoid tea and coffee as they are both diuretics and can dehydrate you even more Always bring a bottle of water with you The airline may run out Once you reach your arrival city adjust your eating schedule a bit to comply with the time change Anytime you sit in one place for over an hour especially at high altitude your body experiences problems You may notice swelling in your lower legs and feet as your circulation is reduced Veteran flyer Bob Jones offers tips to solve your inflight woes Try the twostep method First wear support hose on long flights and second step Step out of your seat and walk the aisles If you cannot get up and move about do your best to stretch and move your legs as much as possible For those in the over group it is also very important to move the rest of your body Simple shoulder shrugs and neck rotation along with arm and back stretching will do wonders for your wellbeing Some basic isometrics or just shifting your position in your seat helps Bottom line is this if you sit still for three or four hours it will take its toll as you get up to leave the airplane Stretch before during and after the trip Elevate your feet if you can Hydrate your skin with lotions and moisturizers to prevent dryness says Nancy The best time to apply moisturizer is when there is still moisture in your pores so start before you board And try to wear larger more comfortable shoes at the airport and inflight Because of the altitude gas in the body will cause slight swelling If you are traveling with kids as Bob often does remember that they need to move too as well as be occupied during the flight Kids tend to be able to sleep on long flights since they can curl right up and go to sleep in a coach seat And Bob says since they are more rested than you try not to be too short with them Always bring activities and order special Kids Meals which are now available on virtually all carriers Activities should be age appropriate and if you are bringing electronic games make sure they are quiet or that the sound can be turned off Be sure to include manual activities like coloring connectthedots and word finders And finally even though the world is shrinking remember to bring a favorite snack for the outbound and return trip Your kids favorite snack may

TALK Holiday tips from the OneTravelcom Experts Holiday travel is arduous at best but some planning and mental programming can save your sanity By now you have your tickets for Thanksgiving travel unless you are going to travel on Thanksgiving Day and should be booking soon if you are traveling over the Hanukkah Christmas or New Years holidays This done consider the following tips as your travel travails begin We all agree th at the easiest way to make holiday travel better is to be flexible and keep a positive mental attitude While the latter may be hard at times just step back and take a deep breath Confrontation will only make things get worse You can always be right later Packing and preshipping ideas With a bit of planning you can travel with just one wheeled carryon and a small carryon bag for an overnighter or a twoweek trip No lost luggage no misrouted or stolen bags And if you miss a connection you can rebook and hop on another plane with all of your baggage in tow For extra comfort replace your shoulder bag strap with a padded golf bag strap or consider using a backpack with two straps to balance the weight evenly Feet can suffer during travel so make sure to wear your most comfortable shoes to t he airport Visualize your luggage as a box full of air all you need to do is fill up the air spaces in the most compressed manner Rolling or folding and overlapping clothes works best Place socks and underwear into shoes and fill every available space Miniaturize your toiletries by pouring small amounts of shampoos lotions and other necessities into reusable plastic travel bottles you can pack these in a fraction of the space Pack only wardrobe essentials Plan to dress in neutrals tans grays blacks wit h some white or accent color for versatility and saved space Pack with plastic bags to keep clothes from wrinkling If you are taking Christmas gifts or a special Thanksgiving dinner treat consider UPS Airborne FedEx and the like The items will arrive ahead of you and theres no chance of them being crushed in the overhead bin by someone who doesnt know whats inside If kids are part of your entourage make sure that they pack their own smal l bag of carryon toys and games to keep them occupied Pack snacks and a surprise in your carryon for them as well When traveling with children travel early with your longest leg over their nap time The white noise of the plane train or family car will lull them to sleep and give you a chanc e to catch your breath as well Most airlines have increased their charges for pets in the cabin and baggag e hold It may cost you between and to take your pet along for the holidays Consider a kennel stay or have a neighbor care for your pet whi le you are gone Travel especially by air can be very traumatic for your pe t Getting to the airport or train Strongly consider public transportation such as a taxi or an airport shuttle If a friend owes you a favor now is the time to cash it in The airport lots will be full and if you dont allow enough time you may pani c while you circle the lot looking for a spot At the airport The Air Transport Association is expecting record numbers of travelers this Thanksgiving holiday Even with these numbers there are things you can do to help make your trip as hasslefree as possible Plan to arrive at the airport at least two hours before your scheduled departure Leave for the airport early enough to allow extra time for increased airport traffic parking trouble and longer luggage checkin and security screening lines With most airfares you can stand by for an earlier or later sameday flight so if you are at the airport early there is always a chance you can get out of town on an earlier flight Note If y ou do not have advance seat assignments you may want to arrive at the airport even earlier Make sure all baggage has your name on the outside If you do not have a baggage identification tag the airline will provide you with one Have your photo identification ready for the agent at checkin Although most airline rules read that they may cancel your reservation if y ou are not at the departure gate ready to board at least minutes before departure dont press your luck Plan to be at the departure gate read y to board at least minutes before departure When it is time to board board The plane may not move until everyone is seated and all carryon baggage is stowed Keep it simple Board the plane stow your stuff sit down and buckle your seat belt Although the airlines tell us that it is not necessary to reconfirm return domestic flights we do and we recommend you do too As soon as you arriv e at your destination contact the airline to reconfirm your return flight an d leave a phone number where you can be reached Next week Tips for
