<6049168.1075858612915.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bwalsh@isda.org,2001-09-24 14:10:05, ISDA Master Agreement Protocol Cc This email is to update you on the status of the ISDA Master Agreement Protocol the Protocol As part of the Protocol there were four annexes that addressed the disappearance of the national currency units on January and the introduction of the euro These four annexes have been separated from the Protocol and published on our website on September as the Euro Protocol The adherence period for the Euro Protocol is September to November It was important to move forward with the Euro Protocol given the specific nature of the timing of the introduction of the euro With respect to Annexes through we propose drafting a new ISDA Master Agreement rather than moving forward with a Protocol The continuing debate on the details of Annexes to the relevance of the Protocol for these provisions and the interest in moving forward with a new ISDA Master Agreement are some of the reasons for this recommendation An extraordinary amount of effort has gone into preparing the Protocol and will provide a strong basis for proceeding with a new ISDA Master Agreement Please let me know what your thoughts are on this suggested approach With respect to Annex the Force Majeure Annex we propose posting a Form of Amendment and the Force Majeure provisions as well as the Commentary on our website This would allow firms to incorporate such language into their Master Agreements on the basis of bilateral negotiation Any views you may have in light of the events of September would be welcome Lastly with respect to Annex the Tax Protocol our Tax Committee will be contacted on Tuesday to determine how to proceed with respect to those issues Any views on this issue would also be welcome Please contact me as soon as possible to share your views I can be reached by email or by phone at Thank you in advance Kimberly Summe General Counsel
<8189205.1075858613307.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bwalsh@isda.org,2001-09-27 06:43:29,SDR ISDA Master Agreement Protocol Cc In response to my email of September regarding the ISDA Master Agreement Protocol I received responses from only seven institutions No clear indication resulted from those seven responses four in favor of proceeding with the Protocol three in favor of working on a new Master Agreement with no Protocol Before ISDA proceeds in either direction it would be helpful to have wider market input I should point out that ISDA intends to work on a new or Master Agreement timing is the only issue whether the process begins imminently or nine months from now The benefits of proceeding with the Protocol is that it takes advantage of the considerable time and effort that has been invested in the initiative to date While the rate of adherence may be diminished somewhat given the continuing skepticism over certain annexes the Protocol remains a convenient and effective way for institutions to amend their Master Agreements It also provides ISDA with some indication of the level of market interest in going forward with drafting a new Master Agreement and what provisions may be problematic On the other hand dissension has been expressed with respect to some of the Protocols annexes namely the expansion of the Default under Specified Transactions the involuntary insolvency provisions and the Replacement Value concept In addition there has been skepticism regarding the appropriateness of proceeding with the Protocol when the rate of adherence may not necessarily generate a new widelyaccepted standard for market practice To a lesser degree those firms that amend their Master Agreements via the Protocol may encounter certain issues when the new Master Agreement is ultimately produced If you have not already contacted me with your response I would be grateful if you could let me know your institutions position as soon as possible Thank you in advance Kimberly Summe General Counsel tel
