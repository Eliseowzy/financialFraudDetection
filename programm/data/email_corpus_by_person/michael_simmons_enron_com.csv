<11933192.1075854585932.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,michael.simmons@enron.com,2000-11-19 06:10:00,Football SNAFU Cc all know the flag football game was called off The current proposed structure is to give tickets to Enron and to AC The team which raises the most by pm Monday for each company will be awarded the tickets And the game will be rescheduled for sometime in the beginning of December Im very disappointed with the way this whole situation has been mishandled I cant speak as to what occurred on the Anderson side but these are my thoughts on this situation All the Enron captains including the Aggies agreed to play Saturday regardless of the weather I confirmed that we would be on as rain and cold weather were very likely to occur Had the other captains decided to not play in the cold rain we could have rescheduled the game for Sunday or an alternative day My understanding is that the Aggies called the game Billy Lemmons and Ted Bland and then changed the awarding of the tickets in way that directly benefitted the Aggie teams Correct me if Im wrong but neither Billy nor Ted were out at the field to judge the weather conditions prior to calling off the game Nor were the captains contacted for their input The rules have been abitrarily changed in midstream to the advantage of the Aggies and this is grossly unfair The top fund raisers for the Enron Aggie teams were to be awarded footballs that were autograped by the Aggie football team Given this additional incentive its not surprising that they raised more money than the UT teams by my unofficial estimates By one estimate who was familiar with the aggie fund rainsing efforts one team raised about and the other raised about So what do we do about this situation Its up to you to decide if you want to play in the rescheduled tournament Personally I dont see much point nor motivation to play It surely wont be for bragging rights as the real UTam game will have already occurred In addition I think it would be appropriate to give the people who donated funds the option to get their money back The situation that now exists is not what I raised money for I want to thank you all for the work and effort you put forth for this event its unfortunate that it wasnt handled better I will be out all of next week Leave me a voicemail if you need to speak to me I will have your shirts on the Monday following Thanksgiving
