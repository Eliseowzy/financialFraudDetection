RalstonEUEnron on From Enron Europe General Announcement ECT Please respond to Jackie GentleLONECT To ECT Europe ECT Asia Pacific cc Subject Newsletter GlobalFlash BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Direct Enron Direct was recently cited by Ofgem for high complaint levels with regard to account complaints per total customers served Enron Direct views the Ofgem customer service measures very seriously and is committed to improving all aspects of its customer service even while enjoying continued strong growth in its retail commodity business However the account complaint level measure is particularly biased against fastgrowing new entrants like Enron Direct Since all of Enron Directs customers have recently switched suppliers which is when most complaints occur and our total customer base is far lower than that of the RECs our account complaint levels per customer tend to appear inflated versus the REC peer group In fact Enron Directs complaint levels for both transfers ie switchers and misselling as measured by Ofgem were well below industry averages While we are not yet bestinclass Enron Directs portrayal as an industry laggard in any aspect of customer service is misleading Stay tuned Relations with UPMKymmene As previously announced Enron Nordic Energy has entered into a two year energy portfolio management agreement with UPMKymmene the forestry industry enterprise This deal creates huge potential for business opportunities across a wide range of areas for Enron As part of the agreement UPMKymmene has requested a dedicated account manager in Oslo In order to comply with this request we have appointed Sami Tenngren on a full time basis to establish the operational framework and to coordinate all Enron relations with UPMKymmene regarding power related issues It is important that all Enron businesses take advantage of this unique opportunity to generate profitable business relations with UPMKymmene If you would like to discuss new business opportunities related to worldwide power with UPMKymmene please contact the Nordic Origination Team Please also keep us informed about any other business development issues related to UPMKymmene

Group is already reviewing the possibilities of utilising the existing metals customer base in Australia to expand these relationships to include power supplypricing a large component of overall costs While it is early days our preliminary discussions on the idea of pricing for power in relation to metal price is receiving a positive response ENRON IN THE PRESS Virtual tanker swaps generate m freight in real terms The inclusion of tanker swaps on Enrons online Internet trading platform in early October has already generated trade for tonnes of tanker freight derivatives contracts worth the equivalent of m of freight in real terms and all based on just one tanker route Volatility in the tanker physical sector prompted Enron to add tanker swaps to its new online platform Enron Director Scott Moncrieff told Lloyds List The reason we started tanker forward freight agreements was because of the volatility We are experiencing the highest levels of volatility since the Gulf War Based on existing figures the Enron team believes that growth in the physical market will fuel freight swaps demand Mr Moncrieff said The market for physical tanker freight will be over b in This will obviously expose a lot of people to risk We want to give our customers as many options as possible so that it reflects their fleet Lloyds List Enron lines up the big players Enron is on line to introduce big players into the dry bulk freight derivatives market in the new year Enrons Pierre Aury told Lloyds List We are now meeting with banks and some have volunteered to trade on behalf of their shipping customers Hopefully by early next year we should see the first trades with these new players After entering the shipping freight swaps market earlier this year the EnronOnline initiative has generated plenty of business and has its creators hope contributed towards liquidity in the other freight overthecounter markets While Enron would like to see even more business come its way surprise has been expressed at how quickly the online market has become established We thought it would have taken longer to take off but we have reached close to m tonnes dry bulk freight swaps traded online Some days we are doing more than the overthecounter markets Our dream target would be to double trade on the forward freight agreement market reasonably quickly said Mr Aury Lloyds List Chance for competitive market Enron wants to trade with Polish energy Experience from West European markets shows that liberalisation leads to a decrease in energy prices for endusers especially plants and companies Competition and the TPA rule gives freedom of choice of contractor and allows implementation of risk management tools It also allows potential investors to objectively evaluate

new communication tool is coming to screens across Europe and in the future throughout Enrons offices worldwide What is Sametime It s a simple tool that integrates with Lotus Notes to allow you to send and receive text messages tofrom Enron colleagues Sametimeis not a replacemen t for email or the phone but rather it should complement both exiting communication tools This is a tool that will be of most value to people wh o spend a lot of time at their PC but who want to ask a question of someone conduct a simple conversation or send a message in real time without havin g to pick up the phone or compose an email message Sametimegives users instant messaging capabilities The green square tells you who is online and able to receive a message while the red dot gives a simple indication of people who may be away from their desk see screen sample below I use the system everyday and find it invaluable in communicating with my team It also comes into its own when communicating with people in other offices especially Houston you can even use it on the road A nice feature is that you can fire off a message to someone and know it will sit on their screen until they read it Sametimesusefulness falls under the Network effect ie the more people online the greater the benefi t Sametime will be available on your desktop in the not too distant future s o watch out for further details Looking forward to sametiming with you soon IT TECHNOLOGY SHOWCASE Dont forget the IT Technology Showcase is coming up on the th st th is month Get ready for an amazing tour of the latest
