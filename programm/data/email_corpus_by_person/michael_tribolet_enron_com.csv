we wish to throw our name in to be cochair The only other marketer on the official committee is Dynegy Reliant is not on the committee but sat in The group generally agreed that the cochairs should be a financial player bank bond or CP and an energy company QF or marketer After the phone call I spoke with Dynegys general counsel John Herbert who is their designated representative He was going to check within his organization whether there was appetite to serve today but was not all that inclined given his day job as he put it I think we would agree that a marketer should be the other cochair as the QFs have a narrow agenda Here are some of the plusses and minuses if we threw our name in Better access to information and guiding consensus Ability to explain the necessity of long term contracts in the solution time commitment will we be more of a lightning rod Regards Michael Original Message From JOHN G KLAUBERG LGMCOMENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESJOHNGKLAUBERGCjklauberLLGMECOMEE NRONcom

Subject Enron MIMEVersion ContentType textplain charsetusascii ContentDisposition inline John Carl and Jim I attended the PGE Committee call today During the call it became apparent that a group of creditors were meeting in a law firms office nearby I therefore walked over and attended the meeting in person I learned that Reliant Dynegy and Meriant had been in the process of forming an ad hoc committee which they had invited Merrill Lynch B of A and some of the QFs to join That unofficial committee had not gotten off the ground when the BK hit All of the official committee members were present either by phone or in person Many had counsel present In addition representatives of Reliant Meriant sp the Ohio State Teachers Assn and a QF called Crockett were permitted to attend Finally representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers which is acting as financial advisors to the Banks and of Saybrook Capital which is acting as advisors to the State of TN were present The US Trustee made a

we wish to throw our name in to be cochair The only other marketer on the official committee is Dynegy Reliant is not on the committee but sat in The group generally agreed that the cochairs should be a financial player bank bond or CP and an energy company QF or marketer After the phone call I spoke with Dynegys general counsel John Herbert who is their designated representative He was going to check within his organization whether there was appetite to serve today but was not all that inclined given his day job as he put it I think we would agree that a marketer should be the other cochair as the QFs have a narrow agenda Here are some of the plusses and minuses if we threw our name in Better access to information and guiding consensus Ability to explain the necessity of long term contracts in the solution time commitment will we be more of a lightning rod Regards Michael Original Message From JOHN G KLAUBERG LGMCOMENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESJOHNGKLAUBERGCjklauberLLGMECOMEE NRONcom

Subject Enron MIMEVersion ContentType textplain charsetusascii ContentDisposition inline John Carl and Jim I attended the PGE Committee call today During the call it became apparent that a group of creditors were meeting in a law firms office nearby I therefore walked over and attended the meeting in person I learned that Reliant Dynegy and Meriant had been in the process of forming an ad hoc committee which they had invited Merrill Lynch B of A and some of the QFs to join That unofficial committee had not gotten off the ground when the BK hit All of the official committee members were present either by phone or in person Many had counsel present In addition representatives of Reliant Meriant sp the Ohio State Teachers Assn and a QF called Crockett were permitted to attend Finally representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers which is acting as financial advisors to the Banks and of Saybrook Capital which is acting as advisors to the State of TN were present The US Trustee made a short presentation regarding duties of committees After they got off the line the creditors each explained their claim as follows Ohio State Teachers M of commercial paper CP B of A M syndicated loan and a letter of credit supporting pollution control bonds Reliant generator owed M Dynegy generator owed M Crockett QF owed M GWF Power nongas fired QF owed M Merrill Lynch holder of CP and unsecured bonds but declined to state amount at this time Meriant generator owed M BONY indenture trustee owed bn State of Tennessee CP holder owed M Davey Tree trade vendor tree trimming owed M US Bank indenture trustee on bond issues totalling M Palo Alto party to contracts relating to WAPA and NCPA owed M but claimed to represent municipalities that could be owed as much as bn if the WAPA contracts are rejected The committee first discussed the SoCal Edison MOU with the governor The proposal does not help the QFs as the rates to be paid to them going forward do not cover their fuel costs and doesnt resolve the generator issues either There also is a major feasibility issue in terms of the ability of the capital markets to absorb bn plus of bonds PGEs lawyers then came in and made a brief presentation They said PGE wont pay out more than it takes in in rates They believe there is enough money in their rates to pay the QFs at rate set in Woods decision going forward they racknowledge that the QFs have been the most hurt they believe their liability for the net short position was cutoff at least as of April as a result of a FERC decision and a decision of the th Circuit and may have been cutoff as of they will continue to pay the DWR cents on an interim basis with a reservation of rights Will not pay more than they collect They expect this to become an issue when the amount they have to pay the DWR goes up to cents they view the PUC as their adversary and want to use the BKY Ct as the forum for financial issues They want creditors support against the PUC they have hired E Y as their financial advisors and Ken Buckfire of Wasserstein as their investment banker they recommended that the Committee retain a PR firm After PGEs counsel departed the Committee turned to organizational issues Clara Yang Strand of B of A offered to serve as Cochair The Committee discussed having one of the generators serve as the other cochair Enron is thinking about it as is Dynegy During breaks both Palo Alto and GWF Power a QF told me they would support Enron to be cochair The Committee then discussed counsel retention A number of firms were discussed Enron suggested Milbank other members particularly the QFs objected because of Milbanks prior representation of the PX Eventually a short list was arrived at of Sheppard Mullin Paul Hastings Sidley Austin OMelveny Skadden These firms will be invited to make a short presentation on Monday The issue on counsel is that Sidley has been involved for quite some time as B of As counsel They seem like the frontrunner for that reason The issue for Enron is whether it is comfortable with the Bank as Chair and the Banks counsel as committee counsel This is perhaps less of an issue if Enron is cochair Next retention of a financial advisor was discussed B of A tried to steamroll PWC through I objected as did BONY that we needed more time so the matter was deferred to Monday Right now the only candidate for the position is PWC do we have any other recommendations My understanding is that the remaining big accounting firms are all engaged by CA utilities I am a little concerned that the process is heading in the direction of the Bank as Chair the Banks lawyer as committee counsel and the Banks financial advisor as the committees advisor We then discussed retaining an investment banker The leading candidate is Saybrook Capital This was tabled in the short term although Saybrook was asked to send a pitch book to the committee Finally we discussed hiring a PR firm and a lobbyist The general sense was that both were a good idea and names will be solicited The Committee will meet in person in Monday in SF starting at PGE was asked to visit at that day Carl and I plan to attend on Monday along with Michael Call me with questions Ben Young

Early Sacramento Reaction to PGE Plan of Reorganization Since the POR was filed weve had many conversations with State legislator s key staffers legal advisors and members of the inner circle of the Gove rnors energy team While the cumulative reaction has been generally negat ive it has been reasonably restrained at the same time The Company and w e strongly recommended that no one at the State draw any lines in the sand until we Companycreditors have had a chance to explain why the POR makes sense and why it will succeed in spite of State objections to the contrary The State issues break down into three categories public policy regulato ry and statutory Public Policy The POR is an affront to State officials who feel that the State went out o f its way in ABx to bolster up noncreditworthy IOUs by providing an alter native means to buy power when no one would deal with the IOUs themselves In response to that move they see PGE pulling things out of PUC ju risdiction where they have been forever and doing so while also quest ioning the DWR revenue requirements thus putting a chilling effect on the ABx bond deal These twin acts have understandably spawned a bitter this is thanks we get response from a number of State officials The State can see why the POR is attractive to the Company and the creditor s At the same time they think that it is a very bad plan for consumers Notwithstanding public comments by the Company to the contrary they feel sure that somehow the POR will result in increased rates Unlike the SCE legislation they dont see the POR giving generators the ha ircut they deserve They understand that the generators will only get a llowed claims but do not view that as sufficient punishment for gouging the public There is concern that if GenCo goes under FERC jurisdiction the stage will be set down the road for sale of the hydro assets to a third party Enron for example Such a transfer will put valuable generating assets in th e hands of a third party that has no accountability to the State Finally they are worried that SCE might find the POR attractive and file t hemselves thereby mooting months worth of legislative effort Regulatory Citing various PUC determinations from the past certain State officials fe el that the POR contravenes State regulations against using operating c ash to pay undercollections that mandate that any transfer of assets f irst get PUC approval and that realized value from the transfer of ass ets goes to the ratepayer not the utility Begging the question of whethe r or not there is a true transfer of assets none of these arguments take into account federal preemption which is of course the key to the whole Plan Statutory ABx passed earlier this year puts a moratorium on the transfer of IOU asse ts for five years As before focusing on this legislation ignores the pre emption issue Specific Stakeholder Responses Of the various State parties voicing concern the PUC as expected is the most vocal While they have expressed outrage and are expected to fight th e POR tooth and nail it is worth noting that their counsel had remarks in the SF Chronicle were at worst neutral The Governor is studying the plan and has thus far been measured in his response Given his penchant for tak ing firm positions when he disagrees with something and with the caveat th at this may be the calm before the storm his comments suggest that he may have at least some concern that the POR has legs A number of the legisl ators share the concerns set forth above but have confined their public co mments to the possibility that rates will rise A couple of their key advi sors bankruptcy counsel and CSFB though have preliminarily noted that t he Plan has a number of clever and attractive features That isnt to say they buy off on the Plan but by not denouncing it up front indeed th e contrary has been true they have helped get the State stakeholders to m oderate their responses pending further review Lastly the consumer grou ps are totally opposed to the POR and remain convinced that they will get s tuck in the end with major rate increases The net effect of all this at the State level at least among the leadersh ip is an even greater sense of urgency to get something done for SCE Tha t of course is much easier said than done see todays LA Times article o n page one of the California section outlining the major rift between the G overnor and Senator Burton Given that the PGE bankruptcy has not been t he disaster anticipated either from the standpoint of service to users or e conomically PGE parent stock has fared much better than Edison parent sto ck since PGE filed on April an increasing number of legislators ask th emselves why should we stick our necks out to protect SCE and maybe ban kruptcy isnt such a bad thing after all So well see The Governors t hird extraordinary session is due to start sometime soon Well be keeping a close eye on that In the meantime we are going to continue our discussions with the State We are coordinating those discussions with the Company to make sure were on the same page The goal remains to get the State to see the wisdom of t he Plan and to minimize their opposition to the greatest extent possible Ill keep you posted

Electric Company Beale Street San Francisco CA Attention and Lawrence C Witalis Re Contract Termination Payment Calculation Discussions Dear Sirs As you know pursuant to its rights under the Master Power Purchase Agreement between Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI and Pacific Gas Electric Company PGE collectively the Parties dated October the MPA EPMI elected to terminate the power transactions thereunder as a result of the bankruptcy filing made by PGE on April Such notice of termination was delivered to PGE on April Additional contract terminations either became effective automatically as a result of PGEs bankruptcy filing under the terms of the particular contract or were elected by certain affiliates of EPMI namely Enron Canada Corp ECC and Enron North America Corp ENA as provided in the relevant termination notices furnished by ECC and ENA to PGE EPMI ECC and ENA are referred to collectively herein as appropriate as Enron and the various contracts andor transactions thereunder between PGE and Enron that were terminated are referred to as the Contracts Pursuant to such contract terminations Enron provided written notice to PGE as reflected in a letter dated April including all applicable supporting materials and calculations of the applicable termination payment calculations due and owing to Enron or PGE as the case may be under the Contracts Under each of the Contracts once the nondefaulting party in this case Enron furnishes the calculations of the termination payments the defaulting party in this case PGE is obligated to notify the nondefaulting party within a specified time frame whether it disagrees with the nondefaulting partys termination value calculations For example under Section of the MPA PGE as the defaulting party due to its bankruptcy is obligated to furnish EPMI within business days of receipt of EPMIs calculations a detailed explanation of any dispute it may have with Enrons termination payment calculations The other Contracts provide for different time periods by which the defaulting party must respond to the nondefaulting partys calculations At our meeting on April we agreed to extend the time period by which PGE must provide notice to Enron of its dispute if any with the termination calculations furnished by Enron under any of the Contracts a Dispute Notice in order to permit further discussions between the Parties the Settlement Discussions concerning the methodology andor procedures employed by Enron to make such calculations and the supporting material therefor and a possible settlement between the Parties with respect to the amount and nature of the Parties claims under the Contracts and the treatment thereof on an aggregate basis In order to provide the Parties with sufficient time to negotiate a possible resolution the date by which PGE shall be required to furnish any Dispute Notice shall be extended to May the Initial Extension Period or such later date as may be agreed by the Parties including any extension as may be effective during the period that any settlement agreement that may be executed by the Parties in connection herewith Settlement Agreement may be under consideration by the Bankruptcy Court During the Initial Extension Period Enron agrees to maintain in full force and effect for the benefit of PGE all five letters of credit with respect to its obligations under the MPA including the letters of credit from Banca di Roma in the amount of from Banca Commerciale Italiana in the amount of from Bayerische Hypound Vereinsbank AG in the amount of and from Banca Nazionale del Lavorno in the amounts of and respectively subject to the rights of EPMI to replace or provide substitutes for such letters of credit to assure payment by Enron of the termination payment if any due from it to PGE under the MPA In the event that the Settlement Discussions have not resulted in the execution of a Settlement Agreement by May but the Parties are continuing to negotiate in good faith with respect thereto Enron agrees to extend for a period of no less than days any letter of credit that shall be due to expire within days after the end of the Initial Extension Period and Enron shall promptly provide PGE with confirmation of such extension In the event that the Parties successfully conclude a Settlement Agreement and such agreement is submitted to the Bankruptcy Court for approval the Parties anticipate that such Settlement Agreement will include a provision requiring the maintenance of letters of credit by Enron during the period the Parties are awaiting Bankruptcy Court approval and the aggregate amount of the letters of credit will be reduced as mutually agreed by the Parties to more closely match the agreedupon amount of the settlement amount due from Enron In the event for any reason the Parties cannot reach closure on a Settlement Agreement or any such Settlement Agreement is agreed to by the Parties but ultimately is not approved without modification by the Bankruptcy Court and thereafter PGE issues to Enron a Dispute Notice under the MPA PGE shall not make or cause to be made a draw under the letters of credit securing Enrons payment obligation under the MPA until the amount of the applicable termination payment due to PGE has been finally determined pursuant to the terms of the MPA and Enron shall have failed to make payment required by it pursuant to Section subject to Section The Parties further acknowledge that in connection with the Parties desire to attempt to negotiate the terms of a Settlement Agreement the Parties anticipate that they will simultaneously commence negotiations concerning new master gas purchase and sale agreements pursuant to which ENA and EEC respectively would sell and PGE would purchase natural gas including under term as opposed to only daily transactions to the extent mutually agreed by the Parties Notwithstanding the foregoing neither PGE nor Enron shall be obligated to enter into any such agreements or transactions it being acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that any decisions or commitments with respect thereto shall be subject to the sole discretion of each of the Parties and no contract or commitment shall occur or be deemed to have occurred until the applicable terms and conditions have been agreed to and definitive agreements have

Kent Kuga Roy Bradford William S Tribolet Michael Mellencamp Lisa Subject RE PGE and Enron StandStill Agreement Elizabeth Four points First I cant call up an attachment to your email can you please resend it Second I believe that the PGE and Enron representatives at the meeting agreed that Enron would keep the LCs in place monthtomonth for the entire period until a settlement is reached and approved by the Bankruptcy Court of course if negotiations break down that monthtomonth requirement could end but the LCs were a principal comfort point for PGE going forward and your changes in this portion of the draft may be unacceptable to us again Ill have to review them to be certain Third I recall that we agreed generally if not specifically that we would give ourselves breathing space to reach an agreement without an artificiallyimposed window as you call it and I do not think such a window is advisable at this time PGE is perhaps even more eager than Enron to resolve the Termination Payment issue and our discussions can always be truncated if talks stall but I do not think such windows do much to promote cooperative efforts generally Fourth I think PGE was very clear in its expectation that as part of these discussions Enron would both enter into new Master Agreements with PGE and into sales of gas on commercially reasonable terms I recall no disagreement from anyone on Enrons side of the table to this proposition and think the draft I sent to you captures the gist of what PGE would like to see Admitterdly without reviewing the markup Im shooting blind a bit here I mention these points mainly as background for my request that you check in with the Enron reps who attended the meeting to see if perhaps your comments are off the mark After Ive read your markup and you have done this minor bit of due diligence we can talk tomorrow hopefully in an attempt to resolve whatever differences we actually may have on the terms of the standstill agreement I very much hope any such differences are more minor than your comments suggest as otherwise this might not be a very good start for our clients efforts to reach an amicable resolution I look forward to talking tomorrow Please suggest a time Thanks Larry From SMTP Sent Monday April AM To Cc Sena David Wan Fong Corp Foley Jack BarLev Joshua Law Pearce Karola Law Harvey Kent Kuga Roy Subject Re PGE and Enron StandStill Agreement Larry In accordance with our conversation late last week I am enclosing a revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was discussed on Wednesday My comments primarily involve the following As you and I discussed last week I thought it made sense to specify a reasonable date by which Enron and PGE shall have reached closure on a settlement agreement on the contract termination and related claims I proposed a one month period to do that If the parties cant come to an agreement in that time period then the mechanics in the MPA for resolving a dispute dealing with the calculation of the termination payment would be reactivated Obviously if we are making progress the parties can always extend the date I felt it was appropriate to specify the window period to make sure that everyone is focused on attempting to get a prompt resolution Assuming a final settlement agreement is agreed upon the conditions of the extension of the stay would be embodied in the settlement agreement itself as opposed to this letter Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in place while the parties were working to see if a settlement agreement could be reached and that requirement is reflected in our revisions to the letter Thus the revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the Initial Extension Period ie to May Your draft had provided that Enron would be required to keep the LCs in place even if no settlement agreement were to be reached My view is that any requirement to maintain the LCs beyond the Initial Extension Period and any conditions with respect thereto if agreed to by Enron should be part of the final settlement agreement executed by the parties rather than as part of this letter Also we note that as a contractual matter the MPA does not require the nondefaulting party to keep in place any security in favor of the defaulting party when as a result of a termination the nondefaulting party owes a payment to the defaulting party See Sec Your draft of the letter provided that Enron agrees to enter into new master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on commercially reasonable terms The revised letter specifies that Enron agrees to negotiate with PGE in these respects simultaneously with the negotiations towards a settlement agreement but any commitment on Enrons part to effect a contract or transaction with PGE will only arise as a result of the parties execution of the definitive transaction documents as opposed to this letter the execution of which shall be in the sole discretion of each of the parties

is not approved without modification by the Bankruptcy Court and thereafter PGE issues to Enron a Dispute Notice under the MPA PGE shall not make or cause to be made a draw under the letters of credit securing Enrons payment obligation under the MPA until the amount of the applicable termination payment due to PGE has been finally determined pursuant to the terms of the MPA and Enron shall have failed to make payment required by it pursuant to Section subject to Section The Parties further acknowledge that in connection with the Parties desire to attempt to negotiate the terms of a Settlement Agreement the Parties anticipate that they will simultaneously commence negotiations concerning new master gas purchase and sale agreements pursuant to which ENA and EEC respectively would sell and PGE would purchase natural gas including under term as opposed to only daily transactions to the extent mutually agreed by the Parties Notwithstanding the foregoing neither PGE nor Enron shall be obligated to enter into any such agreements or transactions it being acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that any decisions or commitments with respect thereto shall be subject to the sole discretion of each of the Parties and no contract or commitment shall occur or be deemed to have occurred until the applicable terms and conditions have been agreed to and definitive agreements have

Kent Kuga Roy Bradford William S Tribolet Michael Mellencamp Lisa Subject RE PGE and Enron StandStill Agreement Elizabeth Four points First I cant call up an attachment to your email can you please resend it Second I believe that the PGE and Enron representatives at the meeting agreed that Enron would keep the LCs in place monthtomonth for the entire period until a settlement is reached and approved by the Bankruptcy Court of course if negotiations break down that monthtomonth requirement could end but the LCs were a principal comfort point for PGE going forward and your changes in this portion of the draft may be unacceptable to us again Ill have to review them to be certain Third I recall that we agreed generally if not specifically that we would give ourselves breathing space to reach an agreement without an artificiallyimposed window as you call it and I do not think such a window is advisable at this time PGE is perhaps even more eager than Enron to resolve the Termination Payment issue and our discussions can always be truncated if talks stall but I do not think such windows do much to promote cooperative efforts generally Fourth I think PGE was very clear in its expectation that as part of these discussions Enron would both enter into new Master Agreements with PGE and into sales of gas on commercially reasonable terms I recall no disagreement from anyone on Enrons side of the table to this proposition and think the draft I sent to you captures the gist of what PGE would like to see Admitterdly without reviewing the markup Im shooting blind a bit here I mention these points mainly as background for my request that you check in with the Enron reps who attended the meeting to see if perhaps your comments are off the mark After Ive read your markup and you have done this minor bit of due diligence we can talk tomorrow hopefully in an attempt to resolve whatever differences we actually may have on the terms of the standstill agreement I very much hope any such differences are more minor than your comments suggest as otherwise this might not be a very good start for our clients efforts to reach an amicable resolution I look forward to talking tomorrow Please suggest a time Thanks Larry From SMTP Sent Monday April AM To Cc Sena David Wan Fong Corp Foley Jack BarLev Joshua Law Pearce Karola Law Harvey Kent Kuga Roy Subject Re PGE and Enron StandStill Agreement Larry In accordance with our conversation late last week I am enclosing a revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was discussed on Wednesday My comments primarily involve the following As you and I discussed last week I thought it made sense to specify a reasonable date by which Enron and PGE shall have reached closure on a settlement agreement on the contract termination and related claims I proposed a one month period to do that If the parties cant come to an agreement in that time period then the mechanics in the MPA for resolving a dispute dealing with the calculation of the termination payment would be reactivated Obviously if we are making progress the parties can always extend the date I felt it was appropriate to specify the window period to make sure that everyone is focused on attempting to get a prompt resolution Assuming a final settlement agreement is agreed upon the conditions of the extension of the stay would be embodied in the settlement agreement itself as opposed to this letter Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in place while the parties were working to see if a settlement agreement could be reached and that requirement is reflected in our revisions to the letter Thus the revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the Initial Extension Period ie to May Your draft had provided that Enron would be required to keep the LCs in place even if no settlement agreement were to be reached My view is that any requirement to maintain the LCs beyond the Initial Extension Period and any conditions with respect thereto if agreed to by Enron should be part of the final settlement agreement executed by the parties rather than as part of this letter Also we note that as a contractual matter the MPA does not require the nondefaulting party to keep in place any security in favor of the defaulting party when as a result of a termination the nondefaulting party owes a payment to the defaulting party See Sec Your draft of the letter provided that Enron agrees to enter into new master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on commercially reasonable terms The revised letter specifies that Enron agrees to negotiate with PGE in these respects simultaneously with the negotiations towards a settlement agreement but any commitment on Enrons part to effect a contract or transaction with PGE will only arise as a result of the parties execution of the definitive transaction documents as opposed to this letter the execution of which shall be in the sole discretion of each of the parties Please call me at your convenience to discuss any questions on the foregoing or on the revised letter Thanks in advance for your help in moving this forward Elizabeth Sager See attached file

Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers Sunday May Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages according to dozens of interviews with regulators lawyers and energy industry workers Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of muchneeded electricity The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of megawatts of generating capacity nearly a third of the states total was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns more than four times as much as a year ago Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand the warm spring and summer months of May to September when electricity usage normally grows by a third Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns And the California Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these gaming tactics contributed to the plants deteriorating condition We suspected it said Jim MacIntosh the manager of grid operations for the ISO It was a sure factor in driving up prices Such swings in unit output he said would only make sense in a scenario when theyre trying to game something Otherwise why would they do that Theyre tearing their units up Unusual phone calls Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the companys headquarters in Houston According to the accounts of three plant operators Reliants operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease then increase output at the megawatt Etiwanda plant This happened as many as four or five times an hour Each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose Then came the phone call to ramp the units back up They would tell us what to do and we would do it said one of the men who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired Afterward we would just sit there and watch the market change The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of California power plants just as the states power crisis began in earnest The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in Houston rather than the reliability needs of the ISO said Carl Wood a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agencys investigation into plant outages Instead of being responsive to demands for reliability theyre responsive to demands for profitability Corporate denial Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the California energy market They and other power companies including AES Corp and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc and Dynegy Inc have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet Californias needs While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every minutes company officials said it was done at the instructions of the ISO to maintain supplydemand balance As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California market design we are required to do that said Kevin Frankeny an operations official with Reliant When the ISO issues dispatch orders they dispatch on a minute basis It can go up and down many times within an hour Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it first The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility but Stephanie McCorkle an ISO spokeswoman said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply And one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers ISO was not calling Reliant every minutes for that said one of the operators Not for an individual unit Officials with the California attorney generals office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated One source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping if proved to have been done to drive up prices could violate the states unfair business practices laws Invisible practice How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators When power companies bid on hourly contracts they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour Generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour By driving up the spot price they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO Then he said it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output By the time the ISO measured again the output was back at the expected level Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down that if the price reached a satisfactory level generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right Other times if the price was low output was brought down and kept down The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in Houston with some being more aggressive than others What they would do especially late at night is if the price tanked they would undergenerate an operator said Then mysteriously the price would go up Then if the schedule was at required megawatt hours of output theyd say Go up to That would cause the price to tank And theyd say Bring it down again Rapid changes These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as to minutes the operators said But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California Edison were more like minutes to avoid stressing the machinery one of the workers said Moreover they were typically run at constant levels which also reduced wear and tear They were basically ramping up as fast as they can and then slamming the brakes on said one of the operators They were increasing the fatigue on the units ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics including instituting a socalled minute market rather than the hourly market so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent day period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost among those companies Plants owned by Reliant AES Mirant Corp and Duke Energy Inc accounted for more than half of the states unplanned shutdowns even though their generating capacity was no more than percent of the states total capacity from all sources Reliant one of Californias largest and most profitable outofstate generators reported shutdowns during the period in March and April It was followed by Mirant Corp of Atlanta AES Corp of Arlington Va and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte NC Reliants unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than megawatts over the day period an average of per day enough power for million homes for one hour Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard with one generating unit down for days accounted for more than of those missed megawatts However an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair They are old At Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliants five California plants And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand But the operators said the issue is not so clearcut One problem at Etiwanda a tube leak had been present for about a month and was previously reported to management they said but it had not deteriorated much it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem Moreover at the time of the shutdown the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to keep the unit online the operators said Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance Ramping may be rampant Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice A source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from AES Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations And an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant coowned by NRG and Dynegy said the practice was used there although less frequently The scheduling calls came from Dynegys trading floor in Houston rather than NRG in Minneapolis he said Steve Stengel a spokesman for Dynegy said changes in output at El Segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day and denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market In a May report the California Energy Commission cited Reliants Etiwanda plant as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants as some of the major beneficiaries of high realtime prices that spring One way to obtain those high prices the plant workers said was the simple method of demanding a skyhigh price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met On one occasion one operator said Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of per megawatt hour even though the legal price cap at the time was The operator said Its our unit shut it off the source said Email Christian

strained equipment Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers Sunday May Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages according to dozens of interviews with regulators lawyers and energy industry workers Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of muchneeded electricity The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of megawatts of generating capacity nearly a third of the states total was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns more than four times as much as a year ago Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand the warm spring and summer months of May to September when electricity usage normally grows by a third Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns And the California Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these gaming tactics contributed to the plants deteriorating condition We suspected it said Jim MacIntosh the manager of grid operations for the ISO It was a sure factor in driving up prices Such swings in unit output he said would only make sense in a scenario when theyre trying to game something Otherwise why would they do that Theyre tearing their units up Unusual phone calls Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the companys headquarters in Houston According to the accounts of three plant operators Reliants operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease then increase output at the megawatt Etiwanda plant This happened as many as four or five times an hour Each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose Then came the phone call to ramp the units back up They would tell us what to do and we would do it said one of the men who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired Afterward we would just sit there and watch the market change The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of California power plants just as the states power crisis began in earnest The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in Houston rather than the reliability needs of the ISO said Carl Wood a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agencys investigation into plant outages Instead of being responsive to demands for reliability theyre responsive to demands for profitability Corporate denial Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the California energy market They and other power companies including AES Corp and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc and Dynegy Inc have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet Californias needs While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every minutes company officials said it was done at the instructions of the ISO to maintain supplydemand balance As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California market design we are required to do that said Kevin Frankeny an operations official with Reliant When the ISO issues dispatch orders they dispatch on a minute basis It can go up and down many times within an hour Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it first The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility but Stephanie McCorkle an ISO spokeswoman said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply And one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers ISO was not calling Reliant every minutes for that said one of the operators Not for an individual unit Officials with the California attorney generals office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated One source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping if proved to have been done to drive up prices could violate the states unfair business practices laws Invisible practice How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators When power companies bid on hourly contracts they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour Generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour By driving up the spot price they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO Then he said it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output By the time the ISO measured again the output was back at the expected level Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down that if the price reached a satisfactory level generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right Other times if the price was low output was brought down and kept down The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in Houston with some being more aggressive than others What they would do especially late at night is if the price tanked they would undergenerate an operator said Then mysteriously the price would go up Then if the schedule was at required megawatt hours of output theyd say Go up to That would cause the price to tank And theyd say Bring it down again Rapid changes These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as to minutes the operators said But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California Edison were more like minutes to avoid stressing the machinery one of the workers said Moreover they were typically run at constant levels which also reduced wear and tear They were basically ramping up as fast as they can and then slamming the brakes on said one of the operators They were increasing the fatigue on the units ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming

this article to a friend Printerfriendly version By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesFederal energy regulators only have the authority to order refunds for about a third of the billion California Gov Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the months to May documents from the states wholesale market operator show Of the total billion came from the MaySeptember period the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said it cant act on and billion from the OctoberMay period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC lacks jurisdiction according to documents from the California Independent System Operator That leaves just billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could potentially order refunded far less than the billion Davis seeks Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday Curtis Wagner the FERC administrative law judge presiding over the talks has said California will likely see refunds from generators but far less than the billion Davis expects Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington DC with one goal and that is to bring back billion Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities the ISO documents show The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for example overcharged California million between May and October David Freeman the governors chief energy adviser and the former general manager of the LADWP said the agency didnt overcharge the state but conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from corporate energy suppliers But during a conference call Sunday with reporters McFadden and Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio couldnt explain how the governor would go about getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices arent regulated by FERC Davis testified before the US Congress last week that generators overcharged the state billion and that FERC should order the refunds State Sen Jim Brulte RRancho Cucamonga has asked for an investigation into Daviss testimony saying the figures were based on shaky calculations To come up with its conclusions the ISO compared hourly market prices received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been expected under competitive market conditions The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive at times about per megawatthour to MWh a fraction of actual prices in the market based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with airquality rules The ISO however typically used the price of gas at Californias northern border according to the documents Generators paid a higher price for the fuel in Southern California raising the cost of making electricity The ISO also used reports of earnings by the states Big Five power suppliers during earnings that for some quadrupled to draw the conclusion that generators overcharged the state according to the documents The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the states three largest utilities failure to buy the power they needed in advance leaving the grid operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute according to the documents The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed amounts between May and February

units back up They would tell us what to do and we would do it said one of the men who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired Afterward we would just sit there and watch the market change The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of California power plants just as the states power crisis began in earnest The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in Houston rather than the reliability needs of the ISO said Carl Wood a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agencys investigation into plant outages Instead of being responsive to demands for reliability theyre responsive to demands for profitability Corporate denial Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the California energy market They and other power companies including AES Corp and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc and Dynegy Inc have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet Californias needs While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every minutes company officials said it was done at the instructions of the ISO to maintain supplydemand balance As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California market design we are required to do that said Kevin Frankeny an operations official with Reliant When the ISO issues dispatch orders they dispatch on a minute basis It can go up and down many times within an hour Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it first The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility but Stephanie McCorkle an ISO spokeswoman said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply And one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers ISO was not calling Reliant every minutes for that said one of the operators Not for an individual unit Officials with the California attorney generals office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated One source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping if proved to have been done to drive up prices could violate the states unfair business practices laws Invisible practice How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators When power companies bid on hourly contracts they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour Generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour By driving up the spot price they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO Then he said it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output By the time the ISO measured again the output was back at the expected level Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down that if the price reached a satisfactory level generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right Other times if the price was low output was brought down and kept down The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in Houston with some being more aggressive than others What they would do especially late at night is if the price tanked they would undergenerate an operator said Then mysteriously the price would go up Then if the schedule was at required megawatt hours of output theyd say Go up to That would cause the price to tank And theyd say Bring it down again Rapid changes These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as to minutes the operators said But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California Edison were more like minutes to avoid stressing the machinery one of the workers said Moreover they were typically run at constant levels which also reduced wear and tear They were basically ramping up as fast as they can and then slamming the brakes on said one of the operators They were increasing the fatigue on the units ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics including instituting a socalled minute market rather than the hourly market so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent day period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost among those companies Plants owned by Reliant AES Mirant Corp and Duke Energy Inc accounted for more than half of the states unplanned shutdowns even though their generating capacity was no more than percent of the states total capacity from all sources Reliant one of Californias largest and most profitable outofstate generators reported shutdowns during the period in March and April It was followed by Mirant Corp of Atlanta AES Corp of Arlington Va and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte NC Reliants unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than megawatts over the day period an average of per day enough power for million homes for one hour Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard with one generating unit down for days accounted for more than of those missed megawatts However an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair They are old At Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliants five California plants And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand But the operators said the issue is not so clearcut One problem at Etiwanda a tube leak had been present for about a month and was previously reported to management they said but it had not deteriorated much it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem Moreover at the time of the shutdown the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to keep the unit online the operators said Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance Ramping may be rampant Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice A source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from AES Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations And an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant coowned by NRG and Dynegy said the practice was used there although less frequently The scheduling calls came from Dynegys trading floor in Houston rather than NRG in Minneapolis he said Steve Stengel a spokesman for Dynegy said changes in output at El Segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day and denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market In a May report the California Energy Commission cited Reliants Etiwanda plant as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants as some of the major beneficiaries of high realtime prices that spring One way to obtain those high prices the plant workers said was the simple method of demanding a skyhigh price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met On one occasion one operator said Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of per megawatt hour even though the legal price cap at the time was The operator said Its our unit shut it off the source said Email Christian

Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers Sunday May Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages according to dozens of interviews with regulators lawyers and energy industry workers Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of muchneeded electricity The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of megawatts of generating capacity nearly a third of the states total was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns more than four times as much as a year ago Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand the warm spring and summer months of May to September when electricity usage normally grows by a third Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns And the California Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these gaming tactics contributed to the plants deteriorating condition We suspected it said Jim MacIntosh the manager of grid operations for the ISO It was a sure factor in driving up prices Such swings in unit output he said would only make sense in a scenario when theyre trying to game something Otherwise why would they do that Theyre tearing their units up Unusual phone calls Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the companys headquarters in Houston According to the accounts of three plant operators Reliants operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease then increase output at the megawatt Etiwanda plant This happened as many as four or five times an hour Each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose Then came the phone call to ramp the

this article to a friend Printerfriendly version By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesFederal energy regulators only have the authority to order refunds for about a third of the billion California Gov Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the months to May documents from the states wholesale market operator show Of the total billion came from the MaySeptember period the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said it cant act on and billion from the OctoberMay period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC lacks jurisdiction according to documents from the California Independent System Operator That leaves just billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could potentially order refunded far less than the billion Davis seeks Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday Curtis Wagner the FERC administrative law judge presiding over the talks has said California will likely see refunds from generators but far less than the billion Davis expects Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington DC with one goal and that is to bring back billion Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities the ISO documents show The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for example overcharged California million between May and October David Freeman the governors chief energy adviser and the former general manager of the LADWP said the agency didnt overcharge the state but conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from corporate energy suppliers But during a conference call Sunday with reporters McFadden and Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio couldnt explain how the governor would go about getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices arent regulated by FERC Davis testified before the US Congress last week that generators overcharged the state billion and that FERC should order the refunds State Sen Jim Brulte RRancho Cucamonga has asked for an investigation into Daviss testimony saying the figures were based on shaky calculations To come up with its conclusions the ISO compared hourly market prices received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been expected under competitive market conditions The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive at times about per megawatthour to MWh a fraction of actual prices in the market based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with airquality rules The ISO however typically used the price of gas at Californias northern border according to the documents Generators paid a higher price for the fuel in Southern California raising the cost of making electricity The ISO also used reports of earnings by the states Big Five power suppliers during earnings that for some quadrupled to draw the conclusion that generators overcharged the state according to the documents The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the states three largest utilities failure to buy the power they needed in advance leaving the grid operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute

this article to a friend Printerfriendly version By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesFederal energy regulators only have the authority to order refunds for about a third of the billion California Gov Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the months to May documents from the states wholesale market operator show Of the total billion came from the MaySeptember period the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said it cant act on and billion from the OctoberMay period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC lacks jurisdiction according to documents from the California Independent System Operator That leaves just billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could potentially order refunded far less than the billion Davis seeks Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday Curtis Wagner the FERC administrative law judge presiding over the talks has said California will likely see refunds from generators but far less than the billion Davis expects Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington DC with one goal and that is to bring back billion Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities the ISO documents show The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for example overcharged California million between May and October David Freeman the governors chief energy adviser and the former general manager of the LADWP said the agency didnt overcharge the state but conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from corporate energy suppliers But during a conference call Sunday with reporters McFadden and Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio couldnt explain how the governor would go about getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices arent regulated by FERC Davis testified before the US Congress last week that generators overcharged the state billion and that FERC should order the refunds State Sen Jim Brulte RRancho Cucamonga has asked for an investigation into Daviss testimony saying the figures were based on shaky calculations To come up with its conclusions the ISO compared hourly market prices received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been expected under competitive market conditions The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive at times about per megawatthour to MWh a fraction of actual prices in the market based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with airquality rules The ISO however typically used the price of gas at Californias northern border according to the documents Generators paid a higher price for the fuel in Southern California raising the cost of making electricity The ISO also used reports of earnings by the states Big Five power suppliers during earnings that for some quadrupled to draw the conclusion that generators overcharged the state according to the documents The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the states three largest utilities failure to buy the power they needed in advance leaving the grid operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute according to the documents The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed amounts between May and February

<345788.1075844242346.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,michael.tribolet@enron.com,2001-05-21 00:55:00,SF Chronicle article Power juggling ramped up price Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers Sunday May Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages according to dozens of interviews with regulators lawyers and energy industry workers Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of muchneeded electricity The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of megawatts of generating capacity nearly a third of the states total was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns more than four times as much as a year ago Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand the warm spring and summer months of May to September when electricity usage normally grows by a third Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns And the California Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these gaming tactics contributed to the plants deteriorating condition We suspected it said Jim MacIntosh the manager of grid operations for the ISO It was a sure factor in driving up prices Such swings in unit output he said would only make sense in a scenario when theyre trying to game something Otherwise why would they do that Theyre tearing their units up Unusual phone calls Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the companys headquarters in Houston According to the accounts of three plant operators Reliants operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease then increase output at the megawatt Etiwanda plant This happened as many as four or five times an hour Each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose Then came the phone call to ramp the units back up They would tell us what to do and we would do it said one of the men who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired Afterward we would just sit there and watch the market change The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of California power plants just as the states power crisis began in earnest The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in Houston rather than the reliability needs of the ISO said Carl Wood a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agencys investigation into plant outages Instead of being responsive to demands for reliability theyre responsive to demands for profitability Corporate denial Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the California energy market They and other power companies including AES Corp and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc and Dynegy Inc have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet Californias needs While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every minutes company officials said it was done at the instructions of the ISO to maintain supplydemand balance As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California market design we are required to do that said Kevin Frankeny an operations official with Reliant When the ISO issues dispatch orders they dispatch on a minute basis It can go up and down many times within an hour Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it first The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility but Stephanie McCorkle an ISO spokeswoman said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply And one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers ISO was not calling Reliant every minutes for that said one of the operators Not for an individual unit Officials with the California attorney generals office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated One source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping if proved to have been done to drive up prices could violate the states unfair business practices laws Invisible practice How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators When power companies bid on hourly contracts they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour Generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour By driving up the spot price they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO Then he said it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output By the time the ISO measured again the output was back at the expected level Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down that if the price reached a satisfactory level generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right Other times if the price was low output was brought down and kept down The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in Houston with some being more aggressive than others What they would do especially late at night is if the price tanked they would undergenerate an operator said Then mysteriously the price would go up Then if the schedule was at required megawatt hours of output theyd say Go up to That would cause the price to tank And theyd say Bring it down again Rapid changes These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as to minutes the operators said But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California Edison were more like minutes to avoid stressing the machinery one of the workers said Moreover they were typically run at constant levels which also reduced wear and tear They were basically ramping up as fast as they can and then slamming the brakes on said one of the operators They were increasing the fatigue on the units ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics including instituting a socalled minute market rather than the hourly market so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent day period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost among those companies Plants owned by Reliant AES Mirant Corp and Duke Energy Inc accounted for more than half of the states unplanned shutdowns even though their generating capacity was no more than percent of the states total capacity from all sources Reliant one of Californias largest and most profitable outofstate generators reported shutdowns during the period in March and April It was followed by Mirant Corp of Atlanta AES Corp of Arlington Va and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte NC Reliants unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than megawatts over the day period an average of per day enough power for million homes for one hour Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard with one generating unit down for days accounted for more than of those missed megawatts However an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair They are old At Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliants five California plants And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand But the operators said the issue is not so clearcut One problem at Etiwanda a tube leak had been present for about a month and was previously reported to management they said but it had not deteriorated much it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem Moreover at the time of the shutdown the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to keep the unit online the operators said Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance Ramping may be rampant Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice A source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from AES Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations And an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant coowned by NRG and Dynegy said the practice was used there although less frequently The scheduling calls came from Dynegys trading floor in Houston rather than NRG in Minneapolis he said Steve Stengel a spokesman for Dynegy said changes in output at El Segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day and denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market In a May report the California Energy Commission cited Reliants Etiwanda plant as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants as some of the major beneficiaries of high realtime prices that spring One way to obtain those high prices the plant workers said was the simple method of demanding a skyhigh price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met On one occasion one operator said Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of per megawatt hour even though the legal price cap at the time was The operator said Its our unit shut it off the source said Email Christian

Utility has recovered its eligible transition costs the conditions for terminating the rate freeze and ending the transition period will have been satisfied At August consistent with transition period accounting mechanisms adopted by the CPUC the Utility credited its TCBA by billion the amount by which a negotiated billion hydroelectric generation asset valuation exceeded the aggregate book value of such assets Based on this credit the Utility believes it recovered its eligible transition costs during August At August there was a balance of approximately billion of undercollected wholesale power costs recorded in the TRA If the final valuation for the hydroelectric assets is greater than billion as the Utility expects the Utility believes it will have recovered its transition costs possibly as early as May The undercollected TRA balance as of the end of the earlier determined transition period will be less than the billion August balance and could be zero depending on the ultimate valuation of the hydroelectric assets and when the transition period actually ends Under current CPUC decisions and AB the Utilitys customers are responsible for wholesale power purchase costs after the Utility has recovered its transition costs In one of its March decisions the CPUC adopted TURNs proposal to transfer on a monthly basis the balance in each utilitys TRA to the utilitys TCBA The accounting changes are retroactive to January The Utility believes the CPUC is retroactively transforming the undercollected power purchase costs in the TRA into transition costs in the TCBA However the CPUC characterized the accounting changes as merely reducing the prior revenues recorded in the TCBA thereby affecting only the amount of transition cost recovery achieved to date The CPUC also ordered that the utilities restate and record their generation memorandum accounts balances to the TRA on a monthly basis before any transfer of generation revenues to the TCBA The CPUC found that based on the accounting changes the conditions for meeting the end of the rate freeze have not been met The Utility believes the adoption of TURNs proposed accounting changes results in illegal retroactive ratemaking and constitutes an unconstitutional taking of the Utilitys property and violates the federal filed rate Original Message From Thome Jennifer Sent Wednesday August PM To Tribolet

Wednesday August PM To Neustaedter Robert Cc Dasovich Jeff Steffes James D Thome Jennifer Kingerski Harry Subject RE California Rate Exposure All I changed the following Reduced total load from GWh to GWh Allocated the costs by utility based on total demand Changed the DWR negative MTM on contracts from B to B Added an undercollection of Billion for SDGE more below I did not Add the Nuclear decommissioning as it is funded on balance sheet I added the following Allocated the Bonds and Contracts on DWR share of Revenue Requirement The CTC is the softest assumption The utilities wrote off considerable Transition Revenue Account undercollection and Transition Cost Balancing Account Balance primarily stranded cost at year end The Regulatory Asset for PGE and Edison is assumed to be primarily TCBA at but there is no footnote to absolutely corroborate this The Undercollection for SDGE is assumed at the Regulatory Asset balance at This is due to the rate freeze having ended for SDGE and therefore their TCBA should be recovered reduced to zero Results One of the key driver to the utilitybyutility allocation is the difference between total volume and share of DWR costs DWR allocated costs to have a uniform rate across the net short by utility Thus those with a larger portion of their total demand SDGE and to a lesser extent PGE which is covered by DWR have a higher unit

like it would any other disaster whether firestorm flood or quake it would dispatch troops to a barren strip of the Central Valley There some lawmakers and energy experts say an outfit such as the US Army Corps of Engineers would swiftly upgrade a transmission bottleneck called Path that virtually ensures rolling outages in the Bay Area and across Northern California this summer Sure the legislators and experts acknowledge there are plenty of wildcards that could make the expected blackouts worse this summer from heat waves to lax conservation from generator breakdowns to plant construction delays But no matter how lucky California gets it will almost certainly suffer because of the Path bottleneck thats played a central role in most of the rotating outages so far The bottleneck prevents authorities from shipping power north from Southern California which sometimes has a surplus supply of electricity As things stand now a fix likely to cost at least million and take two years is mired in the uncertainty of the energy crisis itself Few had heard of Path until the energy crisis and its soaring wholesale power prices developed this winter financially shattering utilities triggering blackouts and forcing the state into the power buying business To spread electricity throughout the West Coast an electron freeway of sorts extends miles between Washington state and Los Angeles Three towering highvoltage transmission lines form that freeway except in one place The network in the zone named Path by engineers narrows to two volt lines stretching southeast from the Los Banos area for about miles to the Coalinga region Parts of the bottleneck are visible to those traveling Interstate In most of this years rolling blackouts the bottleneck has prevented the states transmission grid manager from being able to transfer surplus south state power to Northern California The California Independent System Operator the states grid manager was forced to order rotating outages in only the northern portion of the state The bottleneck also contributed to outages in the Bay Area last June Ironically the bottleneck could have worked in Northern Californias favor this summer helping the region retain surplus hydroelectric power that couldnt squeeze through the bottleneck But dry conditions throughout the Northwest are curtailing that In fact the bottleneck will benefit power plant owners in the north because the scarcity of power will allow them to charge higher prices At the same time generators in the south may be harmed somewhat because they wont be able to get their electricity to more lucrative markets To make matters worse though new power plants to alleviate the crisis are planned both north and south of Path more are planned south of the bottleneck Although there is widespread agreement on the need for quick and bold action on the energy crisis in general and on Path in particular longtime plans to improve the bottleneck are now mired in complex energycrisis politics and the myriad uncertainties of the Pacific Gas and Electric Co bankruptcy We have to pretend like we just had an earthquake Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey said during a recent meeting of her Senate Energy Committee on the crisis Sen Jackie Speier DDaly City immediately responded This is an earthquake Assemblyman Phil Wyman RTehachapi who agrees theres a need for emergency actions as if were at war believes that perhaps the Army Corps of Engineers would be the appropriate agency to tackle the problem with Path owned by PGE Hes authored a bill thrown into limbo by PGEs bankruptcy filing that would earmark million to pay for initial environmental reviews of the Path upgrade Path s two lines were typical when it was built in the s But over the years various utilities have bolstered the rest of the transmission system Although PGE has studied adding an extra line the utility held up because of cost and regulations that make the lines a poor investment Meanwhile energy use outpaced construction of the infrastructure to supply it When PGE went broke this year buying wholesale power at soaring rates and selling it as lower capped retail rates Gov Gray Davis offered a rescue that included state acquisition of Path and the rest of the roughly miles of highvoltage transmission lines owned by the states investorowned utilities The Davis administration as part of the proposal joined PGE in talking about Path improvements But then the utility opted instead to enter bankruptcy proceedings that have thrust the fate of the bottleneck into limbo Utility officials said they are uncertain whether they will gain permission from the federal bankruptcy judge to proceed with the project or whether circumstances will allow it Terry Winter president of CalISO wonders whether the bankruptcy court will with its traditional focus on maximizing the value of the debtors estate recognize the criticality of allowing these investments to go forward The Davis administration moving toward acquisition of SoCal Edisons lines is uncertain whether it will still have the opportunity to purchase the PGE grid that includes Path At the same time a group of northstate municipal utilities has volunteered to finance the transmissionline expansion if the state promises reimbursement But thats something the state isnt willing to do in light of the bankruptcy that leaves the project in PGE hands The Transmission Agency of Northern California said it could have completed the work in just a couple years Even if the way is cleared for the upgrades more foottall steel towers spaced at quartermile intervals dont make popular neighbors Although the area is largely rural citizen protests could delay or stall the work on the lines which some link to radiationrelated health hazards The project would cost between million and million and take years to complete but it is but one of several necessary grid upgrades although most of them are lesser in scope

NRONcom Sent Wednesday May PM To Mellencamp Lisa Tribolet Michael Subject Regulatory Update New developments The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has issued a public notice see attached regarding certain pleadings that were filed for purposes of requesting emergency relief for qualifying facilities QFs The FERCs Notice states that Ridgewood Power LLC Ridgewood submitted a Request for Emergency Relief and an Updated Request for Emergency Relief on March and April respectively requesting the FERC to take action to prevent QF capacity from going offline in the State of California Ridgewood asks the FERC to take actions that will permit those QFs in California that have not been paid fully for past power deliveries to enter arrangements to temporarily sell to thirdparty buyers within California Ridgewood asks the FERC to declare that California electric utilities cannot deny transmission access to QFs or otherwise frustrate the ability of QFs to sell to thirdparty purchasers Similarly the California Cogeneration Council Cogeneration Council on April filed a Motion for Emergency Relief requesting the FERC to take action to prevent QFs from going offline in the State of California The Notice states that among other things the Cogeneration Council requests the FERC to require interconnection transmission and related services under section d of the Federal Power Act on a temporary basis pending the resolution of accounts receivable issues The FERC will address the Cogeneration Councils motion and the responses thereto in the proceeding established for the Ridgewood filings The FERC is also instituting a proceeding under Section d of the Federal Power Act on its own motion In this proceeding the FERC will consider whether and to what extent it may need to order the provision of interconnection transmission and related services under Section d to alleviate generation capacity supply shortages in California Pleadings in response to the FERCs Notice are due by May Edison Mission Energy EME has submitted a filing at the FERC seeking authorization for an internal reorganization The filing states that the purpose of the proposed transaction is to permit Edison International EIX to obtain financing needed to meet its nearterm obligations as well as potential obligations under the Memorandum of Understanding MOU negotiated with the State of California The proposed transaction involves the creation of a new intermediate holding company NewCo between EIX direct subsidiary The Mission Group and The Mission Groups subsidiary EME the new holding company will acquire all of the common stock of EME NewCo will secure new financing using its EME holdings as collateral and dividend proceeds of the financing up to The Mission Group who will transfer the funds to EIX through a loan NewCo will establish a separate corporate structure so that it is structurally remote from a potential bankruptcy of EIX EME has requested that the FERC authorize the restructuring by May EME states that EIX current credit facility matures on May and that additional obligations come due in July and November In addition it states that EIX cash requirements in including its MOU obligations are expected to exceed its cash distributions from subsidiaries The FERC issued a public notice of the filing which provides that any pleadings in response the filing be submitted by May The Independent Energy Producers Association held a press conference to present their report Powerful Ideas which offers solutions for rebuilding Californias troubled electricity market This morning Governor Gray Davis staff hosted a conference call to update the financial community on the Governors plan to address the ongoing California energy crisis Overall Joseph Fichera with Saber Partners and financial advisor to Governor Davis said that the Governors goal is to protect ratepayers and the California economy He added that the Governor wants to focus on rates as well as increasing energy supply The Governors goal is to have a stabilized power market and MW online by Fichera said that the Governors plan is the best option available for dealing with the crisis and that the only other alternative is bankruptcy reorganization The Governors plan which Fichera described as detailed and complex uses the Memorandum of Understanding MOU entered into with Southern California Edison SCE as the template for future agreements with other utilities The MOU requires legislative regulatory and administrative actions to be completed in order to be successful On the legislative side the Governor will send proposed legislation to the California legislature later today or tomorrow At this point no decision has been made regarding sponsorship of the legislation or whether or not the bill will be introduced into the Assembly or the Senate On the regulatory side Fichera said that the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC already has begun to implement portions of the MOU using their normal rulemaking processes Fichera hopes that the CPUC will be able to complete its necessary actions in June or July Finally on the administrative side the Governors staff is moving forward with SCE in negotiating and documenting the definitive agreements that are necessary to implement portions of the MOU These agreements are required to be completed by August With respect to the other utilities the Governor is in the final stages of negotiations with San Diego Gas Electric and expects an agreement to be reached within the next two weeks Fichera also said that PGE remains on the radar screen and that the Governor believes that the successful implementation of the SCE plan as detailed in the MOU will result in PGE coming out of bankruptcy faster The Governors representatives have met with the Unsecured Creditors Committee and their representatives to review the financial information in the MOU and the implementation plans Fichera said that he hopes that PGE will seize the opportunity to take advantage of the proposal on the table He also urged the Wall Street community to speak with PGE to convince the companys management to return to the negotiating table in order to emerge from bankruptcy sooner rather than later Lt Gov Cruz Bustamante filed suit against five power generators in Los Angeles Superior Court alleging the generators conspired to drive up electricity prices and that the five companies gained control of the states power market and used unlawful trading practices to manipulate prices The generators named in the suit are Duke Energy Dynegy Inc Mirant Inc Reliant Energy Inc and Williams Cos SDGE filed suit against three power generators in San Diego Superior Court alleging that the generators illegal shut their plants down during the states power crisis SDGE is asking the judge to order the generators to deliver electricity during peak periods this summer The companies are Sithe Energies Applied Energy and Energy Factors A judge in Riverside County denied the request of Corona Energy Partners LTD a QF to be released from its PPA with SCE US Rep Doug Ose RCalif is introducing a bill to increase hydroelectric power in the West The bill would allow the US secretary of the interior or the secretary of the army to waive restrictions on federal dams to address an emergency

this article to a friend Printerfriendly version By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesFederal energy regulators only have the authority to order refunds for about a third of the billion California Gov Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the months to May documents from the states wholesale market operator show Of the total billion came from the MaySeptember period the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said it cant act on and billion from the OctoberMay period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC lacks jurisdiction according to documents from the California Independent System Operator That leaves just billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could potentially order refunded far less than the billion Davis seeks Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday Curtis Wagner the FERC administrative law judge presiding over the talks has said California will likely see refunds from generators but far less than the billion Davis expects Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington DC with one goal and that is to bring back billion Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities the ISO documents show The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for example overcharged California million between May and October David Freeman the governors chief energy adviser and the former general manager of the LADWP said the agency didnt overcharge the state but conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from corporate energy suppliers But during a conference call Sunday with reporters McFadden and Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio couldnt explain how the governor would go about getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices arent regulated by FERC Davis testified before the US Congress last week that generators overcharged the state billion and that FERC should order the refunds State Sen Jim Brulte RRancho Cucamonga has asked for an investigation into Daviss testimony saying the figures were based on shaky calculations To come up with its conclusions the ISO compared hourly market prices received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been expected under competitive market conditions The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive at times about per megawatthour to MWh a fraction of actual prices in the market based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with airquality rules The ISO however typically used the price of gas at Californias northern border according to the documents Generators paid a higher price for the fuel in Southern California raising the cost of making electricity The ISO also used reports of earnings by the states Big Five power suppliers during earnings that for some quadrupled to draw the conclusion that generators overcharged the state according to the documents The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the states three largest utilities failure to buy the power they needed in advance leaving the grid operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute according to the documents The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed amounts between May and February

that would have authorized state to issue billion in bonds to buy electricity is rejected by Republicans as a bailout after the measure barely passes the Senate By JENIFER WARREN MIGUEL BUSTILLO and CARL INGRAM Times Staff Writers Assemblymen wait for late session on the rescue plan for the states utilities to resume From left Bill Leonard Bill Campbell David Kelley Robert Pacheco and Fred Keeley the measures authorCAROLYN COLE Los Angeles Times SACRAMENTOEfforts to resolve the states power crisis hit a serious snag late Wednesday as the state Assembly appeared unable to pass a bill that would have authorized up to billion in bonds to purchase power and raised electric rates for millions of residents The bill which required a twothirds vote fell just short and legislative leaders scrambled around midnight to see if they could convince three Republicans to change their minds The Senate had passed the bill earlier Wednesday but after a debate that was at times bitterly partisan the Assembly vote came in at short of the votes needed for passage Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell RVilla Park was able to find only one member of his caucus to join him in supporting the bill which was approved by all but one of the Assemblys Democrats I am speaking for myself tonight not as the leader of my caucus because I am not in alignment with my caucus a dejected Campbell said The apparent failure of the measure left legislative leaders uncertain of their next step as they try to stave off bankruptcy for the states two largest electric utilities and reassure financial markets that California will be able to resolve its power crisis Despite the stakes however the Assemblys Republican minority insisted that the proposed cure was worse than the disease This is a bailout and a massive rate increase for the people of California said Assemblyman Tony Strickland RMoorpark one of the leading opponents of the measure Gov Gray Daviswho had repeatedly vowed to avoid using rate hikes to resolve the energy messdefended the bill as essential and said Wednesday afternoon that he would sign it if it passed The measure would allow us to enter into longterm contracts for electricity which will greatly reduce the cost of power in the future Davis said in a letter urging lawmakers to adopt the bill In the absence of such contracts the state is spending about million a day to buy power to keep the lights on Like it or not we are in the power business Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks said as his chamber began debating the bill late Wednesday night Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif greets Southern California Edison executive Steve Frank at committee hearing on the energy crisisAP The longterm contracts that officials hope will lower the states power costs are now under negotiation with S David Freeman the head of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power representing the state in talks with power suppliers The bonds envisioned by the failed bill would have been paid off by electricity customers To guarantee the bondsthus making them attractive on the marketthe bill would have authorized the state Public Utilities Commission to raise rates Rates for residential customers however could go up only if they exceed their baseline or minimum power allowance by more than Southern California Edison calculates that about half of its million customers would have faced a rate increase under the plan unless they reduced energy consumption That provision was roundly attacked by some consumer advocates who called it a bailout of the utilities Still pending are proposals to rescue utilities from the huge debts they have accumulated in the last several months Lawmakers are considering a measure under which the state would issue additional bonds to help the utilities pay off their debts and in return have the public receive a stakethrough a type of stock optionin the companies The utilities have balked at that idea and are pursuing litigation to force further rate hikes to pay off the debts Wednesdays debate was marked by rising criticism of Davis from legislators who have accused him of responding sluggishly to the deepening energy crisis Before Davis letter lawmakers had griped that they didnt know where the governor stood on the bill I will not vote for it unless ownership is declared by the governor said Sen Don Perata DAlameda Either hes for it or hes not Failure of the legislation came as California marked its th straight day in a Stage power emergency with electricity reserves perilously low and grid managers hunting frantically for supplies During Senate debate legislators characterized the vote as a painful one that they hoped they would not later regret But a majority agreed that the alternativedoing nothingwould expose Californians to more blackouts and force the state to keep buying power at exorbitant prices on the spot market Is it a whopper Is it absolutely wonderful No Senate leader John Burton DSan Francisco said before his house approved the measure with the minimum yes votes required Will it help us go forward until we move on some of these problems Yes Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey called the bill a measure that I undoubtedly hate as much as anyone on this floor But it is far less odious than the alternative which is to allow the state to continuewith no end in sightspending million to million a day to buy electricity on the spot market Republicans gave a harsher verdict This is a rate increase make no bones about it said Strickland The consensus in our caucus is no way And Assemblywoman Charlene Zettel RPoway said the debate on the bill resembled what she had heard about the Legislatures action on energy deregulation four years ago before she was elected It seems to me that back then we made a lot of assumptions and we were wrong Zettel said It seems to me were making a lot of assumptions here Also Wednesday Power officials said conservation efforts have succeeded in reducing demand by about megawatts during peak hours enough to keep the lights burning in million homes and sufficient to avoid rolling blackouts for now said Stephanie McCorckle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which manages the state power grid Southern California Edison reiterated that it will not make electricity and debt payments that are due this week An independent audit released Monday pegged the amount due at nearly million The company will not make the payments because it is trying to hold on to its meager store of cash Senior Vice President Tom Higgins said Pacific Gas Electric has said it will default on about billion in electricity and debt payments this week Clarence Brown a spokesman for Edison denounced as outrageous the claims by consumer activists that the utility and its parent company Edison International have profited from Californias illstarred deregulation plan An air quality hearing board told Glendale officials it would schedule a public hearing on the citys request to exceed current pollution limits at its municipal power plant Approval would allow the municipal utility to generate additional power Separately air quality regulators approved a request by Pasadena to operate power turbines for as long as hours a year as long as they have or purchase pollution credits Without the waiver the city could run the turbines for no more than hours annually The bill passed by the Senate on Wednesday AB X by Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek was the first substantial action taken by the Legislature to resolve the crisis that has catapulted Californias energy woes onto the national agenda and spread fears of recession The measures most controversial provision is the approval of rate increases which has sparked both ideological and sectional disputes Sen Jim Battin RLa Quinta for example argued that his desert constituents would bear a disproportionate burden of the increase because high temperatures force them to routinely exceed their baseline power allowancealthough their allowance is larger than that given residents in cooler areas Its not fair and its not right argued Battin who like all but three Republican colleagues voted against the bill or abstained Others complained that the baseline system treats singleperson households and those with five people the same way meaning that larger families are more likely to exceed the minimum and thus face rate hikes But supporters called the bill a compromise that would at least provide some protection for residential consumers And they noted that lowincome residents would continue to enjoy a discount on their monthly bills In Southern California of Edisons customers enjoy such a discount Under the circumstances its a decent bill said Mike Florio a senior attorney at the Utility Reform Network Its what had to be done Its Step in a long long process One indication of how long that process will be is that the bonds contemplated by the measure wouldnot even be floated for months In the meantime the state would have to continue to pay for power out of its general fund at an undetermined cost The measure would have appropriated million for that purpose but further allocations might have been needed depending on the cost of power The legislative debates on the bill were marked by sharp criticism of Davis No more talking about leadership said Campbell the Assembly Republican leader Put up or shut up Time is running out On the Democratic side Perata began circulating a manifesto demanding that Davis take swift actions including establishment of a state power authority that would take ownership of power plants in or out of the state The proposal which Perata plans to introduce today is a nonbinding resolution that would express the sentiments of the Senate Calling the energy crisis a condition of extreme peril to the safety of Californians it asks Davis to prepare a plan to protect residential and small business consumers against unjust and unreasonable rates and immediately convene a meeting of utility creditors to review bankruptcy options facing Edison and PGE The governors office had no immediate comment on the criticism of his performance Today however Davis plans to unveil a publicity campaign to encourage consumers to conserve energy Using radio and television ads centered on the theme flex your power the campaign will urge residents to shift their energy use to periods of the day when demand is low For their part GOP lawmakers from the Senate and the Assembly unveiled a package of proposals aimed at bolstering California energy supplies Sen Tom McClintock the Thousand Oaks Republican who has been working on supplyrelated issues for his party accused the state of actively discouraging the building of new generators over the last years resulting in todays crisis You either begin a crash program of energy development in this state to address the supply side or you do what Gray Davis did which is basically to say if you bring a generator into the state of California well seize your assets and throw you all in jail McClintock said We think that is the wrong approach As the Senate prepared to approve the longterm buying bill a protest outside the governors office led to the arrest of two demonstrators accused of obstructing the doorway More than a dozen consumer activists yelled shame shame shame and waved dollar bills as they protested what they called a taxpayerfinanced bailout of utilities These are multibilliondollar companies that have the ability to bail themselves out without our help said Medea Benjamin a former Green Party US Senate candidate and one of the protesters arrested Times staff writers Andrew Blankstein Mitchell Landsberg and Nancy Rivera Brooks in Los Angeles and Miguel Bustillo Julie Tamaki Rone Tempest and Nancy Vogel in Sacramento contributed to this story

Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase CERA Alert Title Californias Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase URL eprofileuDmD Californias Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase On February the California Assembly approved and the California governor signed a new law intended to secure power supplies for California The legislature has been meeting since early January in a special extraordi nary session to address the power market crisis in the state and the new la w represents their first significant piece of legislation The bill AB establishes a new mechanism for purchasing power for the states busines ses and consumers Whether the mechanism works will depend chiefly on whether the limited revenue source used to pay for the powercollected by the state s investorowned utilities IOUs under current retail rateswill cover wholesale power market costs incurred by the state The law reflects the obsession by California lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on the underlying flaws in Californias market structure AB ushers in several important changes to the California market structure It also contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the state Highlights of the bill include Power buying authority transferred The responsibility for purchasing pow er for the customers of Californias IOUs has been transferred to the Calif ornia Department of Water Resources CDWR The California utilities will continu e to operate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts T he difference between the utilities total load and the sum of their resour ces referred to as the utilities net short amount will be supplie d by CDWR an amount of energy that varies between and megawatts MW depending on the time of year time of day and utility plant availability The utilities most recently performed this function themselves buying energy from the California Power Exchange PX However CDWR has been buying electricity o n behalf of the IOUs since midJanuary when the nearbankruptcy of Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas Electric PGE threatened to disrupt supplies to their customers CDWR is a state agency that manages water reservoirs and transportation systems in the state CDWR uses an enormous amount of electricity to transport water across California and provides critical loadshedding capability to the independent system operator ISO In addition CDWRs reservoirs generate power The CDWR is thus well integr ated in the states electric grid but in the past has not executed large compli cated energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of Californias utilities Portfolio of transactions The intent of AB is to allow CDWR to execute a portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and their customers CDWR has until January to execute contracts CDWR will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse It has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms including monthly annual twoyear threeyear and longer CDWR may also enter into options Thus although CDWRs role is intended to be temporary the contracts th at it executes could extend many years Power for munis CDWR may purchase power on behalf of some California municipal utilities at the municipal utilities election New payment scheme CDWR will be entitled to a portion of existing utilit y rates to pay for the cost of purchased power interest on bonds and administrative expenses This payment stream will be equal to the differenc e between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates averaging about per kilowatthour kWh and the utilities costs to run their own generation plants costs of bilateral and qualifying facility contracts and the costs of ancillary services The CDWR share of retail rates is referred to as the California Purchase Adjustment CPA It is not clear whether the CPA will cover wholesale power market costs Current prices for multiyear power contracts may lie above the CPA In addition if investors believe that the CPA is inadequate to cover costs the entire program may b e abandoned New bonds Bonds will be issued to secure power The total amount of bond s issued may not exceed four times the CPA The state will transfer million from the general fund to jumpstart the program which begins immediately This seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by CDWR from the California utilities customers and municipal utilities if they opt in New residential rate freeze The California Public Utilities Commission CPUC is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it ha s completed paying all outstanding obligations This locks in the recent percent residential rate increase indefinitely Governor Gray Davis thus keeps his pledge not to increase rates further Retail competition To help secure a stable payment stream for the new bonds AB enables the CPUC to prohibit the utilities retail customers from choosing an alternative electricity provider until CDWRs obligations are paid Although the CPUC has yet to act on this the action would effectively halt the competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the CDWR progra m Taxpayer protection AB directs that the new bonds clearly state neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California is pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond Thus the bonds are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates No assets affected The CDWR is granted neither ownership nor control of utility assets Ironically the authority now granted CDWR is what California utilities had essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity prices by executing a portfolio of transactions The utilities were never provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts In addition the utilities have more experience to perform this function than CDWR Rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices California has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing function SCE and PGE are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro m past energy purchases although they will no longer incur costs associated with buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail rates The utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved It is not clear whether the laws prohibition on rate increases for residential customers can be achieved The law is silent on rate increases for commerci al and industrial customers providing a potential path for recovering higherthan expected costs Alternatively CDWR could conceivably find contracts of sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met These contracts would lock in todays retail rates for a long period of time AB is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the power system in California to a more stable footing Key tasks remain Californias wholesale market structure which helped cause the supply crisis by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in California remains unchanged The term contracts CDWR is likely to sign wi ll provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will not be sufficient to encourage

AB when the Utility has recovered its eligible transition costs the conditions for terminating the rate freeze and ending the transition period will have been satisfied At August consistent with transition period accounting mechanisms adopted by the CPUC the Utility credited its TCBA by billion the amount by which a negotiated billion hydroelectric generation asset valuation exceeded the aggregate book value of such assets Based on this credit the Utility believes it recovered its eligible transition costs during August At August there was a balance of approximately billion of undercollected wholesale power costs recorded in the TRA If the final valuation for the hydroelectric assets is greater than billion as the Utility expects the Utility believes it will have recovered its transition costs possibly as early as May The undercollected TRA balance as of the end of the earlier determined transition period will be less than the billion August balance and could be zero depending on the ultimate valuation of the hydroelectric assets and when the transition period actually ends Under current CPUC decisions and AB the Utilitys customers are responsible for wholesale power purchase costs after the Utility has recovered its transition costs In one of its March decisions the CPUC adopted TURNs proposal to transfer on a monthly basis the balance in each utilitys TRA to the utilitys TCBA The accounting changes are retroactive to January The Utility believes the CPUC is retroactively transforming the undercollected power purchase costs in the TRA into transition costs in the TCBA However the CPUC characterized the accounting changes as merely reducing the prior revenues recorded in the TCBA thereby affecting only the amount of transition cost recovery achieved to date The CPUC also ordered that the utilities restate and record their generation memorandum accounts balances to the TRA on a monthly basis before any transfer of generation revenues to the TCBA The CPUC found that based on the accounting changes the conditions for meeting the end of the rate freeze have not been met The Utility believes the adoption of TURNs proposed accounting changes results in illegal retroactive ratemaking and constitutes an unconstitutional taking of the Utilitys property and violates the federal filed rate Original Message From Thome Jennifer Sent

Chairman of the NRON Sent Tuesday October PM To All Enron NRON Subject Lay It On the Line Survey Results Recently I asked you to Lay It On the Line and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address Many of you responded and I want to share the survey results with you Additionally I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward First lets take a look at the survey results In just three days more than employees completed the survey I sincerely appreciate your participation I We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today The responses were Stock price The PRC Employeeinternal morale External reputation and image Walking the talk of integrity and respect II We asked you general questions about working at Enron comparing to of employees responding strongly agreeagree I am committed to staying at Enron Enron is a company I would invest my money in I am treated with respect I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing Enron truly encourages people to take risks My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there III We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron comparing to More Same Less NA Concerned for communities Innovative Entrepreneurial Ethical Trustworthy Arrogant Selfserving IV Finally we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron People the high quality of people at Enron was the most widelycited aspect talented creative learn from one another Culture and reputation innovative spirit willingness to be aggressive and take risks ability to embrace change involvement in community Work environment pay and benefits true meritocracy unlimited opportunities The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward The following are some of the things were doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback Now heres what were going to do based on your feedback STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price which has declined significantly this year The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include A decline in the overall market and economy Certain Enronspecific issues such as California India and recent management turnover A meltdown in the broadband sector which may have been as much as of our stock price at the high Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winters high and Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution wholesale and retail businesses Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth and future earnings growth as has Enron We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve Over the past month we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward Mark Koenig executive vice president of Investor Relations will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions Greg Whalley Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide Watch for these events THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives Nevertheless we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern and we believe we can improve refine streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone Therefore we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to yearend Effective immediately relative performance discussions will occur annually at yearend However business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron Business units will be asked to identify only their top and bottom performers for review by Enrons Office of the Chairman annually at yearend We will continue to use the PEP degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year Finally we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes In the November issue of Enron Business we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process In addition there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to yearend EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale Additionally some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns Effective immediately we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources HR rep We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations ER that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman Cindy Olson will head this function More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days Over the long term we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles We will encourage vice presidents and above as well as other current and emerging leaders to complete Executive Impact Influence training These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people Additionally we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate which will be rolled out immediately Communicate is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video voice mails emails and meetings notes to analyze user performance based on a participants responses and actions EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees We recognize that as Enrons ambassadors in the marketplace the more you know about our strategy performance and challenges the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company To ensure you are better informed We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron In addition to our existing communication efforts like email messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business we will post a QA on current issues on the Enron intranet at homeenroncom This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers As we said before Greg Mark and I as well as members of our Management Committee will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges Look for these to start in midOctober INTEGRITY RESPECT I believe as I said previously we need to reinforce our core values particularly integrity and respect From what you have told us in this survey you agree Enrons values will have more importance in each employees evaluation and feedback We ask that all employees regardless of level hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional specific feedback on employee issues like ethics integrity and individual concerns If you would like to participate in these focus groups please send an email to Cindy Olson Periodically I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results Finally I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enrons strategy and challenges and listening to your concerns and ideas But we would ask for your commitment too We need your dedication to Enron and its values as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve longterm success We will conduct another employee survey early next year Please continue to send me your feedback and lets continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world

this article to a friend Printerfriendly version By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesFederal energy regulators only have the authority to order refunds for about a third of the billion California Gov Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the months to May documents from the states wholesale market operator show Of the total billion came from the MaySeptember period the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said it cant act on and billion from the OctoberMay period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC lacks jurisdiction according to documents from the California Independent System Operator That leaves just billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could potentially order refunded far less than the billion Davis seeks Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday Curtis Wagner the FERC administrative law judge presiding over the talks has said California will likely see refunds from generators but far less than the billion Davis expects Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington DC with one goal and that is to bring back billion Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities the ISO documents show The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for example overcharged California million between May and October David Freeman the governors chief energy adviser and the former general manager of the LADWP said the agency didnt overcharge the state but conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from corporate energy suppliers But during a conference call Sunday with reporters McFadden and Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio couldnt explain how the governor would go about getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices arent regulated by FERC Davis testified before the US Congress last week that generators overcharged the state billion and that FERC should order the refunds State Sen Jim Brulte RRancho Cucamonga has asked for an investigation into Daviss testimony saying the figures were based on shaky calculations To come up with its conclusions the ISO compared hourly market prices received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been expected under competitive market conditions The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive at times about per megawatthour to MWh a fraction of actual prices in the market based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with airquality rules The ISO however typically used the price of gas at Californias northern border according to the documents Generators paid a higher price for the fuel in Southern California raising the cost of making electricity The ISO also used reports of earnings by the states Big Five power suppliers during earnings that for some quadrupled to draw the conclusion that generators overcharged the state according to the documents The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the states three largest utilities failure to buy the power they needed in advance leaving the grid operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute according to the documents The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed amounts between May and February

NRONcom Sent Wednesday May PM To Mellencamp Lisa Tribolet Michael Subject Regulatory Update New developments The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has issued a public notice see attached regarding certain pleadings that were filed for purposes of requesting emergency relief for qualifying facilities QFs The FERCs Notice states that Ridgewood Power LLC Ridgewood submitted a Request for Emergency Relief and an Updated Request for Emergency Relief on March and April respectively requesting the FERC to take action to prevent QF capacity from going offline in the State of California Ridgewood asks the FERC to take actions that will permit those QFs in California that have not been paid fully for past power deliveries to enter arrangements to temporarily sell to thirdparty buyers within California Ridgewood asks the FERC to declare that California electric utilities cannot deny transmission access to QFs or otherwise frustrate the ability of QFs to sell to thirdparty purchasers Similarly the California Cogeneration Council Cogeneration Council on April filed a Motion for Emergency Relief requesting the FERC to take action to prevent QFs from going offline in the State of California The Notice states that among other things the Cogeneration Council requests the FERC to require interconnection transmission and related services under section d of the Federal Power Act on a temporary basis pending the resolution of accounts receivable issues The FERC will address the Cogeneration Councils motion and the responses thereto in the proceeding established for the Ridgewood filings The FERC is also instituting a proceeding under Section d of the Federal Power Act on its own motion In this proceeding the FERC will consider whether and to what extent it may need to order the provision of interconnection transmission and related services under Section d to alleviate generation capacity supply shortages in California Pleadings in response to the FERCs Notice are due by May Edison Mission Energy EME has submitted a filing at the FERC seeking authorization for an internal reorganization The filing states that the purpose of the proposed transaction is to permit Edison International EIX to obtain financing needed to meet its nearterm obligations as well as potential obligations under the Memorandum of Understanding MOU negotiated with the State of California The proposed transaction involves the creation of a new intermediate holding company NewCo between EIX direct subsidiary The Mission Group and The Mission Groups subsidiary EME the new holding company will acquire all of the common stock of EME NewCo will secure new financing using its EME holdings as collateral and dividend proceeds of the financing up to The Mission Group who will transfer the funds to EIX through a loan NewCo will establish a separate corporate structure so that it is structurally remote from a potential bankruptcy of EIX EME has requested that the FERC authorize the restructuring by May EME states that EIX current credit facility matures on May and that additional obligations come due in July and November In addition it states that EIX cash requirements in including its MOU obligations are expected to exceed its cash distributions from subsidiaries The FERC issued a public notice of the filing which provides that any pleadings in response the filing be submitted by May The Independent Energy Producers Association held a press conference to present their report Powerful Ideas which offers solutions for rebuilding Californias troubled electricity market This morning Governor Gray Davis staff hosted a conference call to update the financial community on the Governors plan to address the ongoing California energy crisis Overall Joseph Fichera with Saber Partners and financial advisor to Governor Davis said that the Governors goal is to protect ratepayers and the California economy He added that the Governor wants to focus on rates as well as increasing energy supply The Governors goal is to have a stabilized power market and MW online by Fichera said that the Governors plan is the best option available for dealing with the crisis and that the only other alternative is bankruptcy reorganization The Governors plan which Fichera described as detailed and complex uses the Memorandum of Understanding MOU entered into with Southern California Edison SCE as the template for future agreements with other utilities The MOU requires legislative regulatory and administrative actions to be completed in order to be successful On the legislative side the Governor will send proposed legislation to the California legislature later today or tomorrow At this point no decision has been made regarding sponsorship of the legislation or whether or not the bill will be introduced into the Assembly or the Senate On the regulatory side Fichera said that the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC already has begun to implement portions of the MOU using their normal rulemaking processes Fichera hopes that the CPUC will be able to complete its necessary actions in June or July Finally on the administrative side the Governors staff is moving forward with SCE in negotiating and documenting the definitive agreements that are necessary to implement portions of the MOU These agreements are required to be completed by August With respect to the other utilities the Governor is in the final stages of negotiations with San Diego Gas Electric and expects an agreement to be reached within the next two weeks Fichera also said that PGE remains on the radar screen and that the Governor believes that the successful implementation of the SCE plan as detailed in the MOU will result in PGE coming out of bankruptcy faster The Governors representatives have met with the Unsecured Creditors Committee and their representatives to review the financial information in the MOU and the implementation plans Fichera said that he hopes that PGE will seize the opportunity to take advantage of the proposal on the table He also urged the Wall Street community to speak with PGE to convince the companys management to return to the negotiating table in order to emerge from bankruptcy sooner rather than later Lt Gov Cruz Bustamante filed suit against five power generators in Los Angeles Superior Court alleging the generators conspired to drive up electricity prices and that the five companies gained control of the states power market and used unlawful trading practices to manipulate prices The generators named in the suit are Duke Energy Dynegy Inc Mirant Inc Reliant Energy Inc and Williams Cos SDGE filed suit against three power generators in San Diego Superior Court alleging that the

the Southern California Edison Memorandum of Understanding Commitment to Provide Power SCE will keep its current generation pla nts and other generation assets and commit them to provide power on a regulated costofservice basis for years Dedication of Power Edison International will commit the entire outp ut of Sunrise one of Edison Internationals nonregulated generating faciliti es to the State on a fixed price basis for years Phase I of Sunrise is to be brought online by August If not brought online by August Edison International shall be assessed a million penalty Transmission Sale SCE will sell to the State its transmission assets for approximately billion times the net book value of the assets subject to certain adjustments Of the billion the billion gain on sale will be used to reduce SCEs net undercollected amount as of Ja nuary In connection with the purchase the State will also assume certa in liabilities associated with the transmission assets Backup Transaction If the transmission sale does not occur within tw o years for reasons beyond the parties control then if the State elects SCE shall sell to the State SCEs hydro generation assets If the hydro asse ts are not worth billion then SCE will also sell the state after Decembe r enough belowmarketpricepower to make up the shortfall Conservation Property SCE shall grant perpetual conservation easemen ts to the State covering approximately acres of its Big Creek hydroelectr ic related lands and acres of its Eastern Sierra hydroelectric related lands Some of the land may be deeded in fee Contribution by Edison International Edison International will refun d to SCE not less than million This money will consist of a refund of approximately million in estimated quarterly tax payments plus approximately million in federal loss carryback tax savings Investment Edison International and SCE will invest not less than billion over the next years in capital improvements for SCE Litigation SCE shall dismiss certain claims including its takings a nd filed rate doctrine cases CPUC Regulation CPUC shall continue to regulate SCE using historical principles of ratemaking Payment for Portion of QF Dropoff SCE shall pay an amount that represents that portion of the net short from January to April that is attributable to QFs not selling to SCE due to SCEs fa ilure to pay the QFs SCE will securitize this amount Securitization SCE shall securitize its full net undercollected amou nt approx billion The securitization shall occur in two tranches i e two different nonbypassable dedicated rate components The first tranche will occur after the passage of legislation and the signing of the definitive agreements and will cover the net undercollected amount less the gain on sale plus interest on certain obligations in the net undercollected amount The second tranche would be triggered if the transmission sale does not occur within two years Accordingly the second tranche would not show up in rates for two years if at all Buying the Net Short The State will be required to buy the net short through December After SCE will be responsible for covering the net short Investment Recovery SCE shall have an authorized rate of return that will not drop below its current rte during the year cost of service ratemaking period Next Steps Definitive Agreements and CPUC Action Definitive Agreements Once the MOU is signed the next stage is to negotiate definitive agreements which contain the specific terms of the transmission sale as well as the specific terms of the various other relat ed agreements eg the OM Agreement Transmission Services Agreement and th e Facilities Services Agreement CPUC Action Prior to entering into the definitive agreements the CP UC must undertake certain actions which include establishing mechanisms for preapproval of procurement costs and URG costs deferring SCEs general rate case until granting SCE some relief from direct access credits and clarifying the first priority condition in the holding company act

like it would any other disaster whether firestorm flood or quake it would dispatch troops to a barren strip of the Central Valley There some lawmakers and energy experts say an outfit such as the US Army Corps of Engineers would swiftly upgrade a transmission bottleneck called Path that virtually ensures rolling outages in the Bay Area and across Northern California this summer Sure the legislators and experts acknowledge there are plenty of wildcards that could make the expected blackouts worse this summer from heat waves to lax conservation from generator breakdowns to plant construction delays But no matter how lucky California gets it will almost certainly suffer because of the Path bottleneck thats played a central role in most of the rotating outages so far The bottleneck prevents authorities from shipping power north from Southern California which sometimes has a surplus supply of electricity As things stand now a fix likely to cost at least million and take two years is mired in the uncertainty of the energy crisis itself Few had heard of Path until the energy crisis and its soaring wholesale power prices developed this winter financially shattering utilities triggering blackouts and forcing the state into the power buying business To spread electricity throughout the West Coast an electron freeway of sorts extends miles between Washington state and Los Angeles Three towering highvoltage transmission lines form that freeway except in one place The network in the zone named Path by engineers narrows to two volt lines stretching southeast from the Los Banos area for about miles to the Coalinga region Parts of the bottleneck are visible to those traveling Interstate In most of this years rolling blackouts the bottleneck has prevented the states transmission grid manager from being able to transfer surplus south state power to Northern California The California Independent System Operator the states grid manager was forced to order rotating outages in only the northern portion of the state The bottleneck also contributed to outages in the Bay Area last June Ironically the bottleneck could have worked in Northern Californias favor this summer helping the region retain surplus hydroelectric power that couldnt squeeze through the bottleneck But dry conditions throughout the Northwest are curtailing that In fact the bottleneck will benefit power plant owners in the north because the scarcity of power will allow them to charge higher prices At the same time generators in the south may be harmed somewhat because they wont be able to get their electricity to more lucrative markets To make matters worse though new power plants to alleviate the crisis are planned both north and south of Path more are planned south of the bottleneck Although there is widespread agreement on the need for quick and bold action on the energy crisis in general and on Path in particular longtime plans to improve the bottleneck are now mired in complex energycrisis politics and the myriad uncertainties of the Pacific Gas and Electric Co bankruptcy We have to pretend like we just had an earthquake Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey said during a recent meeting of her Senate Energy Committee on the crisis Sen Jackie Speier DDaly City immediately responded This is an earthquake Assemblyman Phil Wyman RTehachapi who agrees theres a need for emergency actions as if were at war believes that perhaps the Army Corps of Engineers would be the appropriate agency to tackle the problem with Path owned by PGE Hes authored a bill thrown into limbo by PGEs bankruptcy filing that would earmark million to pay for initial environmental reviews of the Path upgrade Path s two lines were typical when it was built in the s But over the years various utilities have bolstered the rest of the transmission system Although PGE has studied adding an extra line the utility held up because of cost and regulations that make the lines a poor investment Meanwhile energy use outpaced construction of the infrastructure to supply it When PGE went broke this year buying wholesale power at soaring rates and selling it as lower capped retail rates Gov Gray Davis offered a rescue that included state acquisition of Path and the rest of the roughly miles of highvoltage transmission lines owned by the states investorowned utilities The Davis administration as part of the proposal joined PGE in talking about Path improvements But then the utility opted instead to enter bankruptcy proceedings that have thrust the fate of the bottleneck into limbo Utility officials said they are uncertain whether they will gain permission from the federal bankruptcy judge to proceed with the project or whether circumstances will allow it Terry Winter president of CalISO wonders whether the bankruptcy court will with its traditional focus on maximizing the value of the debtors estate recognize the criticality of allowing these investments to go forward The Davis administration moving toward acquisition of SoCal Edisons lines is uncertain whether it will still have the opportunity to purchase the PGE grid that includes Path At the same time a group of northstate municipal utilities has volunteered to finance the transmissionline expansion if the state promises reimbursement But thats something the state isnt willing to do in light of the bankruptcy that leaves the project in PGE hands The Transmission Agency of Northern California said it could have completed the work in just a couple years Even if the way is cleared for the upgrades more foottall steel towers spaced at quartermile intervals dont make popular neighbors Although the area is largely rural citizen protests could delay or stall the work on the lines which some link to radiationrelated health hazards The project would cost between million and million and take years to complete but it is but one of several necessary grid upgrades although most of them are lesser in scope

mood in the state Highlights of the bill include Power buying authority transferred The responsibility for purchasing pow er for the customers of Californias IOUs has been transferred to the Calif ornia Department of Water Resources CDWR The California utilities will continu e to operate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts T he difference between the utilities total load and the sum of their resour ces referred to as the utilities net short amount will be supplie d by CDWR an amount of energy that varies between and megawatts MW depending on the time of year time of day and utility plant availability The utilities most recently performed this function themselves buying energy from the California Power Exchange PX However CDWR has been buying electricity o n behalf of the IOUs since midJanuary when the nearbankruptcy of Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas Electric PGE threatened to disrupt supplies to their customers CDWR is a state agency that manages water reservoirs and transportation systems in the state CDWR uses an enormous amount of electricity to transport water across California and provides critical loadshedding capability to the independent system operator ISO In addition CDWRs reservoirs generate power The CDWR is thus well integr ated in the states electric grid but in the past has not executed large compli cated energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of Californias utilities Portfolio of transactions The intent of AB is to allow CDWR to execute a portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and their customers CDWR has until January to execute contracts CDWR will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse It has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms including monthly annual twoyear threeyear and longer CDWR may also enter into options Thus although CDWRs role is intended to be temporary the contracts th at it executes could extend many years Power for munis CDWR may purchase power on behalf of some California municipal utilities at the municipal utilities election New payment scheme CDWR will be entitled to a portion of existing utilit y rates to pay for the cost of purchased power interest on bonds and administrative expenses This payment stream will be equal to the differenc e between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates averaging about per kilowatthour kWh and the utilities costs to run their own generation plants costs of bilateral and qualifying facility contracts and the costs of ancillary services The CDWR share of retail rates is referred to as the California Purchase Adjustment CPA It is not clear whether the CPA will cover wholesale power market costs Current prices for multiyear power contracts may lie above the CPA In addition if investors believe that the CPA is inadequate to cover costs the entire program may b e abandoned New bonds Bonds will be issued to secure power The total amount of bond s issued may not exceed four times the CPA The state will transfer million from the general fund to jumpstart the program which begins immediately This seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by CDWR from the California utilities customers and municipal utilities if they opt in New residential rate freeze The California Public Utilities Commission CPUC is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it ha s completed paying all outstanding obligations This locks in the recent percent residential rate increase indefinitely Governor Gray Davis thus keeps his pledge not to increase rates further Retail competition To help secure a stable payment stream for the new bonds AB enables the CPUC to prohibit the utilities retail customers from choosing an alternative electricity provider until CDWRs obligations are paid Although the CPUC has yet to act on this the action would effectively halt the competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the CDWR progra m Taxpayer protection AB directs that the new bonds clearly state neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California is pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond Thus the bonds are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates No assets affected The CDWR is granted neither ownership nor control of utility assets Ironically the authority now granted CDWR is what California utilities had essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity prices by executing a portfolio of transactions The utilities were never provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts In addition the utilities have more experience to perform this function than CDWR Rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices California has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing function SCE and PGE are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro m past energy purchases although they will no longer incur costs associated with buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail rates The utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved It is not clear whether the laws prohibition on rate increases for residential customers can be achieved The law is silent on rate increases for commerci al and industrial customers providing a potential path for recovering higherthan expected costs Alternatively CDWR could conceivably find contracts of sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met These contracts would lock in todays retail rates for a long period of time AB is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the power system in California to a more stable footing Key tasks remain Californias wholesale market structure which helped cause the supply crisis by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in California remains unchanged The term contracts CDWR is likely to sign wi ll provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will not be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities In addition Californias siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged The state must still address the need to expedite the development of new power plants AB does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale ener gy costs of Californias utilities The state has been negotiating a deal w ith the utilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission asset s to the state However the utilities have achieved recent court victories that may pave the way to a courtdirected recovery of these costs Recent audits indicate that SCE and PGE recovered their stranded costs early in which should have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes A legal showdown between the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable end Follow above URL for full report Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek Shooting the Rapids Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future in Houston February For more information and to

that would have authorized state to issue billion in bonds to buy electricity is rejected by Republicans as a bailout after the measure barely passes the Senate By JENIFER WARREN MIGUEL BUSTILLO and CARL INGRAM Times Staff Writers Assemblymen wait for late session on the rescue plan for the states utilities to resume From left Bill Leonard Bill Campbell David Kelley Robert Pacheco and Fred Keeley the measures authorCAROLYN COLE Los Angeles Times SACRAMENTOEfforts to resolve the states power crisis hit a serious snag late Wednesday as the state Assembly appeared unable to pass a bill that would have authorized up to billion in bonds to purchase power and raised electric rates for millions of residents The bill which required a twothirds vote fell just short and legislative leaders scrambled around midnight to see if they could convince three Republicans to change their minds The Senate had passed the bill earlier Wednesday but after a debate that was at times bitterly partisan the Assembly vote came in at short of the votes needed for passage Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell RVilla Park was able to find only one member of his caucus to join him in supporting the bill which was approved by all but one of the Assemblys Democrats I am speaking for myself tonight not as the leader of my caucus because I am not in alignment with my caucus a dejected Campbell said The apparent failure of the measure left legislative leaders uncertain of their next step as they try to stave off bankruptcy for the states two largest electric utilities and reassure financial markets that California will be able to resolve its power crisis Despite the stakes however the Assemblys Republican minority insisted that the proposed cure was worse than the disease This is a bailout and a massive rate increase for the people of California said Assemblyman Tony Strickland RMoorpark one of the leading opponents of the measure Gov Gray Daviswho had repeatedly vowed to avoid using rate hikes to resolve the energy messdefended the bill as essential and said Wednesday afternoon that he would sign it if it passed The measure would allow us to enter into longterm contracts for electricity which will greatly reduce the cost of power in the future Davis said in a letter urging lawmakers to adopt the bill In the absence of such contracts the state is spending about million a day to buy power to keep the lights on Like it or not we are in the power business Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks said as his chamber began debating the bill late Wednesday night Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif greets Southern California Edison executive Steve Frank at committee hearing on the energy crisisAP The longterm contracts that officials hope will lower the states power costs are now under negotiation with S David Freeman the head of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power representing the state in talks with power suppliers The bonds envisioned by the failed bill would have been paid off by electricity customers To guarantee the bondsthus making them attractive on the marketthe bill would have authorized the state Public Utilities Commission to raise rates Rates for residential customers however could go up only if they exceed their baseline or minimum power allowance by more than Southern California Edison calculates that about half of its million customers would have faced a rate increase under the plan unless they reduced energy consumption That provision was roundly attacked by some consumer advocates who called it a bailout of the utilities Still pending are proposals to rescue utilities from the huge debts they have accumulated in the last several months Lawmakers are considering a measure under which the state would issue additional bonds to help the utilities pay off their debts and in return have the public receive a stakethrough a type of stock optionin the companies The utilities have balked at that idea and are pursuing litigation to force further rate hikes to pay off the debts Wednesdays debate was marked by rising criticism of Davis from legislators who have accused him of responding sluggishly to the deepening energy crisis Before Davis letter lawmakers had griped that they didnt know where the governor stood on the bill I will not vote for it unless ownership is declared by the governor said Sen Don Perata DAlameda Either hes for it or hes not Failure of the legislation came as California marked its th straight day in a Stage power emergency with electricity reserves perilously low and grid managers hunting frantically for supplies During Senate debate legislators characterized the vote as a painful one that they hoped they would not later regret But a majority agreed that the alternativedoing nothingwould expose Californians to more blackouts and force the state to keep buying power at exorbitant prices on the spot market Is it a whopper Is it absolutely wonderful No Senate leader John Burton DSan Francisco said before his house approved the measure with the minimum yes votes required Will it help us go forward until we move on some of these problems Yes Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey called the bill a measure that I undoubtedly hate as much as anyone on this floor But it is far less odious than the alternative which is to allow the state to continuewith no end in sightspending million to million a day to buy electricity on the spot market Republicans gave a harsher verdict This is a rate increase make no bones about it said Strickland The consensus in our caucus is no way And Assemblywoman Charlene Zettel RPoway said the debate on the bill resembled what she had heard about the Legislatures action on energy deregulation four years ago before she was elected It seems to me that back then we made a lot of assumptions and we were wrong Zettel said It seems to me were making a lot of assumptions here Also Wednesday Power officials said conservation efforts have succeeded in reducing demand by about megawatts during peak hours enough to keep the lights burning in million homes and sufficient to avoid rolling blackouts for now said Stephanie McCorckle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which manages the state power grid Southern California Edison reiterated that it will not make electricity and debt payments that are due this week An independent audit released Monday pegged the amount due at nearly million The company will not make the payments because it is trying to hold on to its meager store of cash Senior Vice President Tom Higgins said Pacific Gas Electric has said it will default on about billion in electricity and debt payments this week Clarence Brown a spokesman for Edison denounced as outrageous the claims by consumer activists that the utility and its parent company Edison International have profited from Californias illstarred deregulation plan An air quality hearing board told Glendale officials it would schedule a public hearing on the citys request to exceed current pollution limits at its municipal power plant Approval would allow the municipal utility to generate additional power Separately air quality regulators approved a request by Pasadena to operate power turbines for as long as hours a year as long as they have or purchase pollution credits Without the waiver the city could run the turbines for no more than hours annually The bill passed by the Senate on Wednesday AB X by Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek was the first substantial action taken by the Legislature to resolve the crisis that has catapulted Californias energy woes onto the national agenda and spread fears of recession The measures most controversial provision is the approval of rate increases which has sparked both ideological and sectional disputes Sen Jim Battin RLa Quinta for example argued that his desert constituents would bear a disproportionate burden of the increase because high temperatures force them to routinely exceed their baseline power allowancealthough their allowance is larger than that given residents in cooler areas Its not fair and its not right argued Battin who like all but three Republican colleagues voted against the bill or abstained Others complained that the baseline system treats singleperson households and those with five people the same way meaning that larger families are more likely to exceed the minimum and thus face rate hikes But supporters called the bill a compromise that would at least provide some protection for residential consumers And they noted that lowincome residents would continue to enjoy a discount on their monthly bills In Southern California of Edisons customers enjoy such a discount Under the circumstances its a decent bill said Mike Florio a senior attorney at the Utility Reform Network Its what had to be done Its Step in a long long process One indication of how long that process will be is that the bonds contemplated by the measure wouldnot even be floated for months In the meantime the state would have to continue to pay for power out of its general fund at an undetermined cost The measure would have appropriated million for that purpose but further allocations might have been needed depending on the cost of power The legislative debates on the bill were marked by sharp criticism of Davis No more talking about leadership said Campbell the Assembly Republican leader Put up or shut up Time is running out On the Democratic side Perata began circulating a manifesto demanding that Davis take swift actions including establishment of a state power authority that would take ownership of power plants in or out of the state The proposal which Perata plans to introduce today is a nonbinding resolution that would express the sentiments of the Senate Calling the energy crisis a condition of extreme peril to the safety of Californians it asks Davis to prepare a plan to protect residential and small business consumers against unjust and unreasonable rates and immediately convene a meeting of utility creditors to review bankruptcy options facing Edison and PGE The governors office had no immediate comment on the criticism of his performance Today however Davis plans to unveil a publicity campaign to encourage consumers to conserve energy Using radio and television ads centered on the theme flex your power the campaign will urge residents to shift their energy use to periods of the day when demand is low For their part GOP lawmakers from the Senate and the Assembly unveiled a package of proposals aimed at bolstering California energy supplies Sen Tom McClintock the Thousand Oaks Republican who has been working on supplyrelated issues for his party accused the state of actively discouraging the building of new generators over the last years resulting in todays crisis You either begin a crash program of energy development in this state to address the supply side or you do what Gray Davis did which is basically to say if you bring a generator into the state of California well seize your assets and throw you all in jail McClintock said We think that is the wrong approach As the Senate prepared to approve the longterm buying bill a protest outside the governors office led to the arrest of two demonstrators accused of obstructing the doorway More than a dozen consumer activists yelled shame shame shame and waved dollar bills as they protested what they called a taxpayerfinanced bailout of utilities These are multibilliondollar companies that have the ability to bail themselves out without our help said Medea Benjamin a former Green Party US Senate candidate and one of the protesters arrested Times staff writers Andrew
