mailto Sent Saturday January PM Subject Fw Message from Marine Recon in Afganistan Thought you might find this interesting got it from a friend at work The following was read on the Sully and Scooter Radio KOGO in San Diego Show on Nov Just outside of Ab Gach in the northwest panhandle of Afghanistan between Tajikstan and Pakistan November Bizarre Its expletive freezing here Im sitting on hard cold dirt between rocks and shrubs at the base of the Hindu Kush mountains along the Dar yoi Pomir River watching a hole that leads to a tunnel that leads to a cave Stake out my friend and no pizza delivery for thousands of miles I also glance at the area around my ass every ten to fifteen seconds to avoid another scorpion sting Ive actually given up battling the chiggers and sand fleas but them expletive scorpions give a jolt like a cattle prod Hurts like a bastard The antidote tastes like transmission fluid but God bless the Marine Corps for the five vials of it in my pack The one truth the Taliban cannot escape is that believe it or not they are human beings which means they have to eat food and drink water That requires couriers and thats where an old bounty hunter like me comes in handy I track the couriers locate the tunnel entrances and storage facilities type the info into the handheld shoot the coordinates up to the satellite link that tells the air commanders where to drop the hardware we bash some heads for a while then I track and record the new movement Its all about intelligence We havent even brought in the snipers yet These scurrying rats have no idea what theyre in for We are but days away from cutting off supply lines and allowing the eradication to begin I dream of bin Laden waking up to find me standing over him with my boot on his throat as I spit a bloody ear into his face and plunge my nickel plated Bowie knife through his frontal lobe But you know me Im a romantic Ive said it before and Ill say it again This country blows man Its not even a country There are no roads theres no infrastructure theres no government This is an inhospitable rockpit expletive ruled by eleventh century warring tribes There are no jobs here like we know jobs Afghanistan offers two ways for a man to support his family join the opium trade or join the army Thats it Those are your options Oh I forgot you can also live in a refugee camp and eat plumsweetened crushed beetle paste and squirt mud like a goose with stomach flu if thats your idea of a party But the smell alone of those tent cities of the walking dead is enough to hurl you into the poppy fields to cheerfully scrape bulbs for eighteen hours a day And let me tell you something else Ive been living with these Tajiks and Uzbeks and Turkmen and even a couple of Pushtins for over a month and a half now and this much I can say for sure These guys all of em are Huns Actual living Huns They LIVE to fight Its what they do Its ALL they do They have no respect for anything not for their families or for each other or for themselves They claw at one another as a way of life They play polo with dead calves and force their fiveyearold sons into human cockfights to defend the family honor Huns roaming packs of savage heartless beasts who feed on each others barbarism Expletive cavemen with AK s Then again maybe Im just cranky Im freezing my expletive off on this stupid expletive hill because my lap warmer is running out of juice and I cant recharge it until the sun comes up in a few hours Oh yeah You like to write letters right Do me a favor Bizarre Write a letter to CNN and tell Judy and Bernie and that awful sneering pompous Aaron Brown to stop calling the Taliban smart They are not smart I suggest CNN invest in a dictionary because the word they are looking for is cunning The Taliban are cunning like jackals and hyenas and wolverines They are sneaky and ruthless and when confronted cowardly They are hateful malevolent parasites who create nothing and destroy everything else Smart Pfft Yeah theyre real smart Theyve spent their entire lives reading only one book and not a very good one as books go and consider hygiene and indoor plumbing to be products of the devil Theyre still figuring out how to work a Bic lighter Talking to a Taliban warrior about improving his quality of life is like trying to teach an ape how to hold a pen eventually he just gets frustrated and sticks you in the eye with it OK enough Snuffle will be up soon so I have to get back to my hole Covering my tracks in the snow takes a lot of practice but Im getting good at it Please tell my fellow Americans to turn off their TV sets and move on with their lives The story line you are getting from CNN is utter expletive and designed not to deliver truth but rather to keep you glued to the screen through the commercials Weve got this one under control The worst thing you guys can do right now is sit around analyzing what were doing over here because you have no idea what were doing and really you dont want to know We are your military and we are doing what you sent us here to do You wanna help Buy some expletive stocks America Saucy Jack
