derivatives approved IFR Default swap collapse opens arbitrage window IFR Lightrade expands pooling points network IFR ISDA Finalizes Credit Derivatives Restructuring Document Dow Jones IRS Should Implement Broad Risk Standard In Hedging Regulations Witnesses to Urge BNA May By Alison Bennett Proposed rules REG on hedging transactions do not go far enough in implementing a new risk management standard enacted by Congress several witnesses are expected to tell the Internal Revenue Service May Issued in January the rules are intended to reflect changes under the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of Pub L No for businesses entering hedging transactions DTR G L That law changed the standard for qualifying hedging transactions from one focusing on risk reduction transactions to one centered around risk management transactions Several witnesses are expected to tell IRS officials at a hearing that the proposed rules fall short of what Congress intended in implementing the new broader standard Broad Standard Favored Andrea Kramer McDermott Will Emery Chicago is expected to testify that while the government did try to incorporate the new risk management standard into the rules its efforts did not go far enough While the proposed regulations generally define a hedging transaction in terms of the required risk management standard many of the operative provisions revert back to the risk reduction standard of the current regulations Kramer said in written comments to IRS Kramer said she objected to statements in the rules that a transaction that is not entered into to reduce a taxpayers risk does not manage risk and others that she said would if adopted as final regulations effectively negate the statutory changes Congress thought it was making The McDermott Will Emery practitioner is expected to contend the final regulations must be conformed throughout to replace the concept of risk reduction with that of risk management In addition she will urge IRS to provide examples of modern risk management activities that would constitute qualifying hedging transactions Commodities Rule Requested Earl Goldhammer representing Americas Energy Partner is expected to make similar points at the hearing In an outline submitted to IRS Goldhammer said the final rules should allow hedging treatment for certain commodities derivatives transactions entered into in the normal course of business by commodities dealers According to the outline qualifying transactions should relate to a derivative valued in reference to a commodity also handled by the dealer fall within preapproved controls on speculation set out in formally adopted risk management policies and not be identified by the commodities dealer as having been entered into in its dealer capacity This proposal recognizes the existence of appropriate and inevitable differences between each dealer in commodities as to its risk tolerances and risk management techniques he said Weather Energy Derivatives Salomon Smith Barney Tax Director Mark Perwien representing the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc New York also is likely to criticize the references to risk reduction found under the proposed rules To properly implement congressional intent Perwien said in an outline of his testimony the proposed rules should extend hedging transaction status to all transactions undertaken in the ordinary course of business that alter the taxpayers exposure to one or more of the risks inherent in the taxpayers core economic activities Perwien also is expected to urge IRS to provide hedge transaction status to weather and energy supply derivatives Likewise he said in the outline the service should permit hedges of dividend streams overall profitability and other business risks that do not relate directly to interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations Insurance Concerns Mark Canter representing the American Council of Life Insurers Washington DC will bring specific industry concerns to the hearing Canter is likely to assert that life insurers utilization of gap hedging transactions should be allowed hedging treatment because they are entered into in the normal course of business to manage risk with respect to interest rate changes Without a change to the proposed rules gap hedges of life insurers may be inappropriately denied hedging treatment solely because of an unworkable test in the preamble that requires them to be more closely associated with liabilities than assets Canter said in an outline of his oral comments The fifth and final witness Linda Carlisle of White Case LLP Washington DC is expected to ask IRS to extend hedging treatment to risk management transactions for services income derived from converting one commodity into another Testifying on behalf of the Interstate Natural Gas Association Carlisle also will urge the agency to clarify that weather derivatives may hedge price risks EMBBIS data show OTC derivatives activity slowed in H Reuters May BASEL Switzerland May Reuters Growth in the huge market for overthecounter derivatives slowed in the second half of with volume of outstanding contracts rising just one percent from the end of June the Bank for International Settlements BIS said on Tuesday Growth in the first half had been nearly seven percent The BIS bases its estimates on the notional amount of outstanding OTC contracts which totaled trillion at the end of December Notional value reflects the size of the underlying transactions on which the derivatives instruments are based The interest rate derivatives segment the single largest in terms of OTC traded instruments had a notional value of trillion at end percent of the total market Swaps are the single largest category in the interest rate category amounting to trillion at the end of December In the specific case of the interest rate swap market the deceleration in growth was in sharp contrast to the very rapid pace of business seen since the end of the BIS said Eurodenominated contracts accounted for trillion or nearly onethird of the total volume of interest rate derivatives outstanding at the end of A seven percent drop in eurodenominated interest rate contracts was a major factor behind slower growth in the second half the BIS said The BIS cited financial sector consolidation reduced issuance of some types of domestic securities including German Pfandbriefe which are often hedged with swaps and belated efforts by banks to clean up their preeuro legacy currency portfolios as likely factors behind the drop Counterparties most affected by this were interdealer brokers the BIS added Meanwhile volume in dollardenominated interest rate swaps remained buoyant That market second behind eurodenominated swaps accounted for trillion in notional value at the end of up around percent from endJune GROWTH IN OTC STARTS TO LOOK LIKE EXCHANGETRADED BUSINESS The BIS data show the pace of growth in the OTC market which once outstripped that seen for exchangetraded instruments slowed after rapid expansion in the past decade OTC derivatives volume based on notional value rose by percent for all of compared with growth in exchangetraded contracts of percent The BIS gave no indication whether it thought the OTC market would pick up again in the first half of Its statistics also omit data on the fastgrowing market for credit derivatives While growth in notional value slowed in the second half socalled gross market values which reflect the cost of replacing a derivatives contract rose by percent in the same period to trillion from trillion at endJune Estimated gross market values experienced the most pronounced increase since the BIS began collecting data on the OTC market the BIS said The BIS which serves as a bank to and forum for the worlds central banks began collecting the data in It gave no reasons for the discrepancy for the relatively rapid growth in OTC gross market value The largest absolute increase here was seen in foreign exchange contracts which rose by billion in the final six months of The BIS gave no reason for the large increase in the gross market value relative to notional amounts which rose to trillion for currency instruments also up one percent Currency activity picked up in the latter part of however while a drop in shortterm interest rates relative to long rates could have raised the value of interest rate swaps Federal Home Loan Bank of New York meets full FAS compliance with Principia Partners solution M Presswire May

Service May By Nicholas Elliott NEW YORK Dow Jones Singlestock futures have drawbacks that may limit their use according to Philip McBrideJohnson head of exchangetraded derivatives at law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher Flom and a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission McBrideJohnson was speaking at the Third Annual Derivatives Expo Tuesday He pointed out that because singlestock futures which were legalized under the Commodity Futures Modernization Act passed last December will be regulated by both the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission the costs of regulation will be higher than for other futures or for options on stocks For current users of options on stocks McBrideJohnson noted that futures on stocks entail a higher cost in margin payments plus a standard fee paid by options users to the SEC McBrideJohnson added that of the international exchanges that list futures on stocks and options on stocks the volume of options traded is times larger than on the futures He pointed out that the new law prohibits options on singlestock futures for at least three years another limit on the appeal of such futures McBrideJohnson stressed that he

market got a partial reprieve last month from an onerous provision in the US Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB new derivatives accounting standard FAS requires companies to report option premium volatility due to time value changes theta in their earnings Endusers say this causes earnings volatility that many of them cannot tolerate and which they argue makes no sense to report if they plan to hold the hedge to maturity Endusers are currently scaling back their use of complex options and swaptions in favour of simpler hedging tools that qualify for FAS s hedge accounting which allows endusers to avoid reporting the effective portion of a hedges fair value fluctuations in earnings Indeed of endusers in a recent survey of about US corporations and asset mangers by Greenwich Associates a Greenwich Connecticutbased research firm said FAS would cause them to reduce their use of interest rate options with saying it would force a significant reduction A handful of highprofile US derivatives endusers led by home mortgage securitisation giant Fannie Mae lobbied unsuccessfully for a change in the option provision last year The group proposed that the timevalue component of an options premium be amortised into earnings over its life Rejection The FASB rejected this approach during its comment period for FAS and again last autumn when the group pressed once more for an amendment Risk October page After the years of controversy leading up to FAS s passage the board is loath to reopen the standard for amendments Rather the FASBs derivatives implementation group DIG a task force of accountants and derivatives industry members that churns out advice on how to implement FAS has devised a guideline that skirts the need for an amendment We are not amortising time value as was proposed last year in one of the amendments says Timothy Lucas director of research and technical activities at FASB and chairman of the DIG There will definitely be no amendment he says The implementation guideline is no panacea Essentially the DIG has proposed that all changes in an options fair value be recorded under other comprehensive income OCI a part of a companys equity account until the date that the hedged transaction affects earnings Then the fair value of the hedge should offset the fair value of the exposure But the option must match the underlying exactly it must pass all FAS s effectiveness test requirements It must match the timing of the underlying cashflow and there must be no basis risk FASB put the proposal out for a fiveweek comment period on April Fannie Mae and other endusers say they are scrutinising it and expect to submit comments this month The FSAs hardliner Risk May By Matthew Crabbe Is there a schism between the New York Federal Reserve Bank and the UKs Financial Services Authority FSA A speech delivered by William McDonough president of the New York Fed and chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to the annual meeting of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association in Washington last month seemed to offer the prospect of a cut in the w charge a capital floor on credit derivative positions or even its full removal The Basel Committee may have confused legal risk with op risk in its conception of the charge McDonough said It seemed for a while as if the derivatives business might have persuaded the Basel Committee to make an historic Uturn on a charge that ISDA says will damage the credit derivatives business If the w charge is anyones idea it is Oliver Pages Page joined the Bank of England in from Cambridge and worked his way through the statistics division the forex division the international division and then markets supervision He moved with other supervisors to the new FSA in where he became director of financial supervision for complex international groups the largest UK banks Last month that responsibility was expanded to include major insurance companies and the division was renamed the major financial groups division In recent speeches FSA chairman Howard Davies has been hammering home the message that insurance companies should be subject to the same prudential standards of the Basel Accord as banks Page is also chairman of the Basel Committees capital group and one of that groups subgroups covers credit risk mitigation This is the source of the detail of the w charge the w stands for weight it was Pages idea to label it so David Clementi deputy governor of the Bank of England has also been making hawkish noises about the hidden dangers of the credit derivatives business Page says too much has been read into McDonoughs speech This is a consultative paper we are talking about he says The operational risk charge is a concept that still has to be fleshed out Even the internal ratingsbased approach to credit calculations still has to be fleshed out And banks are only just waking up to the message that by October these proposals will be decided But while everything is open to discussion Page insists The w charge is not a mistake We the Basel Committee decided last year that if we could locate capital charges closer to the risks then those charges would be more accurate Speaking at an FSAorganised conference in London the following week McDonough failed to repeat the suggestion that the w charge could be about to go I still think people are reading too much into what they think was said in Washington about the w charge There are some material risks there and this is the solution that people on the Committee signed up for Page says the w charge is not just a kneejerk response to last Septembers loan restructuring by Conseco the US insurer a restructuring that triggered default clauses under ISDAs standard documentation for credit derivatives Even if it were specifically a charge for the legal risk involved in writing credit protection that doesnt mean it should not be charged separately but wrapped up in Basels sweeping charge for operational risks says Page And anyway this is not a pure legal risk charge ISDA tried to get the documentation for credit derivatives right twice and now they are changing it again Thats not about legal risk its about the risk that credit derivatives do not pay out when people expect them to Its about the instability of the documentation As for the op risk charge Page rejects the idea that banks should be able to take out insurance instead Just because its been laid off the risk is not zero he says What is the evidence that insurance companies can lay off the risk somewhere else So there may be differences in opinion among the Basel Committees members but a deal was done And if there are going to be any changes to the proposals for a new Accord they must be decided quickly because the proposals are going to be set in six months time This is a sensitive stage in the global regulatory process the FSA believes The Basel Committees January deadline for the implementation of the new Accord was seen as a concession to European banks and their supervisors by the Fed The FSA has told the EU it must move fast if it wants its Capital Adequacy Directive which parallels Basels New Accord to be ready at the same time The FSA is not just worried that there will be an uneven regulatory playing field for banks with US banks being forced by the supervisors into their own capitalefficient superleague while flabby European banks fall behind It also wants to stamp its authority as the allembracing single regulator for UK financial markets responsible for consumer protection and the safety of the financial system The nod and a wink style of market supervision that the Bank of England perfected over the years has gone replaced by the kind of bold statement favoured by US government agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission Building society use of credit derivatives approved IFR May The UK Treasury last week proposed legislation that would allow building societies to use credit derivatives for risk management purposes UK building societies are already active users of interest rate and currency derivatives and wilt be able to hedge against borrower default if the legislation is passed The UK parliament has Just broken up ahead of the June general election but a change in the law to extend the use of credit derivatives could still K enacted later this year The most active debt issuers and hedgers among building societies have converted from mutual status in recent years With Halifax and Alliance Leicester among those following Abbey National in turning themselves into listed banks There are still building societies in the UK with total assets of more than olbbn however and credit derivatives dealers in London can be exported to start pitching credit protection products to the societies in advance of any actual change in the law Nationwide is the biggest remaining building society in asset terms followed by Britannia and Yorkshire Even assuming that legislation allowing credit derivatives use is passed building societies will not be able to use default swaps to take speculative positions The Building Societies Act of restricts derivatives use to risk management purposes and sets out a list of risk factors where derivatives use is permissible Default swap collapse opens arbitrage window IFR May By Jon Macaskill At least Ebn and possibly as much as Ebn equivalent of creditlinked note issuance has been seen in the last month The resulting offsetting of short credit default swap positions has caused a sharp widening in the negative basis between default swaps and the asset swap value of the underlying debt in the secondary bond market Dealers with access to corporate bonds have been able to buy default swaps at levels as much as bp under the asset swap value of the debt and to create synthetic packages for their clients where in effect the only risk is to the counterparty on the swap Credit derivatives dealers who chanced to be flat have been turning huge profits by proprietary dealing and from sales of these packages to their favoured insurance company customers Deutsche Bank Merrill Lynch Bear Stearns and Citigroup have been among the most aggressive sellers of default swaps in recent weeks according to dealers at rival houses and their crossing of bidoffer spreads has driven the negative default swap basis to bonds ever wider A Ebn creditlinked note issued by Deutsche Bank is typical of the deals that have been fuelling this movement The deal Deutsche Bank Repon offered exposure to separate corporate credits from the US and from Europe Because Deutsche Bank had the deal rated the terms of the issue spread across trading desks in London and New York and rival dealers pulled hack their bids on default swaps in the relevant corporates Other banks were selling similar unrated and therefore private credit linked notes at the same times which led to a scramble to offset swap positions Faced with a shortage of bonds in the secondary market and repo rates at for some corporate issues forced to hit whatever bid was available in the default swap market pushing the negative basis for many investment grade fiveyear default swaps from an bpbp negative basis to a bp bp basis last week This produced wild diversity between default swaps for corporates that had seen their debt used for creditlinked notes and similar companies that had not Lufthansa fiveyear default swaps were offered at bp late last week while British Airways offers in the same maturity were no lower than bp for example Many default swaps were also very low on an absolute basis Single A rated French pharmaceuticals company Aventis was quoted at bpbp for a fiveyear default swap at the close of dealing on Friday for example Other corporate default swaps were also at extremely tight levels with RollsRoyce offered as low as bp in the fiveyear Volkswagen at bp BMW offered at least as low as bp and Unilever at bp Run for the door The movement was not limited to European credits Offsetting of default swaps led to the sale of negative basis packages in US names including Sears Bank of America and Philip Morris with Bank of America trading at levels below bp in the fiveyear or less than half its trade point when fears about US bank credit quality were at their height earlier this year General market sentiment that the worst of the current downturn in credit quality has passed has amplified the effect of the default swap selling Investors are happy to hold corporate bonds which has left dealers struggling to buy paper to cover their positions as tentative to selling default swaps Everyone tried to run for the door at the same time said one head dealer describing trading in recent weeks He predicted that the wide negative basis between swaps and bonds will be a trading feature for some time Dealers worry that the banks which are selling default swaps most aggressively are more synthetic credit linked notes As long as they can maintain a margin between the notes and the level at which they can offset their exposure they will keep hitting swap bids This collision of default swap offset needs a bond shortage and improved credit sentiment is working in favour of corporate treasurers WorldCom managed to sell the biggest deal yet from a US corporate last week and saw spread talk on what proved to be an USbn equivalent deal tighten ahead of pricing An issue of this size would normally prompt a sharp widening in default swaps on the relevant corporate but WorldCom saw its fiveyear mid quotes fall from bp two weeks ago to below lObp last week The decline in default swap quotes and widening basis to asset swap levels for bonds has been restricted to Europe and the US so far If sentiment about the credit quality of Asian corporates improves there could be note issuance and spread movement The dealers who have been struggling to cover their positions in the supposedly liquid US and European bond and swap markets may be reluctant to try the same approach in Asia however With the prospect of more issuance of creditlinked notes on US and European corporates and maintenance of the wide negative swap to bond basis dealers who are allowed to run proprietary positions and their insurance company clients should reap further windfall arbitrage profits The traders forced to offset deals issued by their structured note departments face further weeks of anxious hedging however Lightrade expands pooling points network IFR May The time it takes to deliver bandwidth between New York and Los Angeles will soon get a little shorter Lightrade the neutral pooling point operator is expanding its network of pooling points the high capacity switches that deliver bandwidth between buyers from New York to Los Angeles The pooling centre is under construction at present but plans are under way to complete the connection by the end of June according to Doug Minster vicepresident of corporate development at Lightrade Lightrade formed in November began establishing pooling points or carrier hotels in most major US metropolitan cities to shorten the time it takes to deliver bandwidth and provide the quality of service measurements needed to efficiently connect all parties Beginning with Seattle Lightrade operates its pooling points in cities including Philadelphia Washington Atlanta Miami Chicago Dallas and San Jose The pooling point operator is focusing on deploying seven or eight more pooling point centres throughout the US with San FranciscoDenver and HoustonBoston in progress The company is also investigating opportunities in Europe Energy companies are excited about the prospect of more pooling point expansion as that is one of the catalysts they believe will accelerate bandwidth trading and derivatives use A carrier could bring in a large pipe and split off and give smaller pipes to multiple different entities Minster said As much as of the trading that is occurring now in the bandwidth market is via Lightrade pooling points according to an energy trader The Lightrade active switch equipment that can be controlled from a personal computer is favoured by energy traders over alternative passive cross connect panels that may be cheaper noted another energy trader Mike Pardun vicepresident marketing and development at Colocom a neutral colocation provider that offers facilities and power to carriers and service providers including Lightrade agreed that telecoms traders have a particular need for multiple pooling point operators The Holy Grail of bandwidth trading only becomes a reality when true multicarrier bandwidth on demand is enabled by seamlessly traversing multiple pooling points said Pardun As a neutral operator Lightrade does not own any fibre just the switches that facilitate the faster buying and selling of bandwidth It does not get involved in any actual trading but charges a port fee to connect to its equipment and a delivery fee Though Enron El Paso and Williams Communications all operate pooling points of their own Lightrade is not in direct competition with them There is a natural disinclination for other energy companies to want to do business with them since they are not a neutral body Some companies like Enron also use Lightrade pooling points Other carriers however do not have a compelling incentive to interconnect with Lightrade as they often prefer to avoid the pooling point middleman and swap bandwidth among themselves Some opposition to Lightrade also stems from Lightrades favouring of the trading community over the carriers notes Cobs Pardun He adds that Lightrade and bandwidth traders in general have not yet convinced the carriers that matter that there is revenue to be had that tips the balance away from the perceived threat of the commoditisation of bandwidth Companies that have attempted to have neutral bandwidth trading platforms as well as operate neutral pooling points have had conflicts arise RateXchange the online trading exchange for bandwidth and futures products shut down its neutral pooling points that were deployed globally for that very reason The trading platform is often viewed as competing with online brokers and conflicts existed in cultivating their business through the neutral pooling point according to Nick Coil senior vicepresident of trading operations at RateXchange It was not as much with the energy trading groups but it was still an issue he adds RateXchange has three pooling points in Europe that were shut down last year and still have to be uninstalled Competition could conic from virtual pooling points that perform a similar role as the neutral pooling points but use software instead of deploying a large unit Companies such as Telseon are already breaking ground with the use of highspeed gigabit ethernet services Pooling Points Corporation is also entering this market with the use of a Teletrade Intelligent Platform that uses realtime analysis but it is not expected to be ready until later this year ISDA Finalizes Credit Derivatives Restructuring Document Dow Jones May By Joe Niedzielski NEW YORK Dow Jones The International Swaps and Derivatives Association said Friday that it has finalized and published the restructuring supplement to its ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions The supplement which was previewed in early April at the trade groups annual meeting in Washington DC includes changes to what kind of underlying financial instruments can be delivered in the event of a creditrestructuring event The Supplement represents the consensus of a diverse range of constituents in the credit derivatives markets including portfolio managers credit protection sellers and dealers Robert Pickel ISDAs executive director and CEO said Friday in a press release Credit default swaps are overthecounter derivatives contracts that let investors transfer the default risk on loans or bonds by selling it to a third party for a premium that is derived from the notional amount of the contract The language of these contracts generally allows protection buyers to collect on their default swaps if a debt instrument such as a loan is restructured and the underlying instruments coupon is reduced or its maturity is lengthened Buyers can also usually collect if there is some other type of credit event that would make the loan economically impaired But the restructuring of loans last year made to Conseco Inc CNC created some stir in the market Market participants who had bought default swap protection on the Conseco credit were able to deliver cheap cash bonds to dealers and receive par in exchange Some of the maturities on longerdated bonds that were delivered far outweighed the maturity of the loans Some dealers then decided to remove the restructuring language from the contracts on newly written business Those dealers and others noted that the Conseco example amounted to a cheapest to deliver opportunity that wasnt the initial intent of how these contracts should be settled The primary change that ISDA and its credit derivatives market practice committee announced in April limits the maturity of physical securities that can be delivered if a restructuring event is declared Under the new supplement credit protection buyers would be limited to delivering physical securities with a maturity of less than months following the restructuring date or to the extended maturity of the restructured loan Since the supplement was previewed in April ISDAs credit derivatives market practice committee have worked to finalize several details in the proposal ISDA said These include the definition of an eligible transferee for certain deliverable obligations under a credit derivative transaction ISDA said the full test of the restructuring supplement is available on its web site End of ISDA Press Report for May THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS

restructuring info session ECB intervention fails to bolster euro Corporates Caught Napping As Deadline For FAS looms Derivatives traders at JP Morgan are delighted Derivatives Week November Tax Change to Boost Danish Derivatives Market A change in Danish tax law that is expected to be passed this month should lead to a surge in derivatives use among pension funds and life insurance companies Jens Kristensen head of the financial division at the Danish Ministry of Economic Affairs in Copenhagen said the tax rates for all the gains on investments for pension funds and life insurance companies are being equalized at Previously there were tax incentives to investing in cash equitiesgains on equity positions were taxed at The flip side of this was that nonequity investments including hedging were taxed at a much higher rate and losses on cash investments were not offsettable against gains on hedges Clause Stampe chief investment officer at pension fund Laegernes Pensionskasse in Copenhagen said it plans to increase its use of derivatives because of the taxation change It will use more derivatives to hedge all of its noneuro and nonkrone denominated fixed income portfolio and its equity portfolio where it feels there is currency risk About of the funds DKK billion USD billion portfolio is in noneuro or kronedenominated fixed income products The pension fund already occasionally uses foreign exchange swaps and options to hedge equity investments but not fixed income products Stampe said he envisages its use of derivatives to hedge equity would increase slightly but said it was too early to estimate by how much Pensionskassen for jusristernes og okonomernes a pension fund is going to start using derivatives according to Jesper Jakobsen strategist and head of asset allocation in Copenhagen He said it was too early to tell exactly what strategies it will pursue but he envisages the fund will use derivatives for hedging all asset classes because of the change in tax law Previously there was a lower tax for equity to encourage Danish pension funds and life insurance companies to invest in local equities With global capital increasingly dominating the local equity market local institutional investors are no long required to maintain liquidity on the Danish stock market Derivatives Week November ISDA plans restructuring info session The International Swaps ant Derivatives Association is holding a meeting in the next two weeks to discuss restructuring as a credit event Credit derivatives players recently were at loggerheads regarding whether restructuring should be listed as a credit event under the standard terms of singlename credit default swaps DW A group of dealers in New York elected last month to stop including restructuring as a credit event when quoting prices for standard singlename credit default swaps Restructuring as a credit event will still be available as a menu choice on the ISDA confirm ant will not be removed from the ISDA definitions According to Bob Pickel general counsel at ISDA in New York dealers and end users have had numerous questions regarding the decision and ISDAs credit derivatives documentation task force is providing a forum for those questions to be answered Some dealers reported a slowdown in the credit default swap market following the decision Others said that they saw no slowdown in their trading activity and noted that even if there was a slowdown it cannot be linked to the decision Cash markets remain volatile and there has been little in the way of new bond issuance or loan activity recently they added Pickel emphasized that the main point of the meetings is to allow participants to provide information rather than provide a forum for debate Because this is a market practice issue it is not up to ISDA to rule how parties should trade Meetings will be held concurrently in New York and London with a brief conference call joining both of the meetings The meeting is open to all ISDA members Separately ISDA is planning to complete its strategic documentation review by yearend Financial Times November ECB intervention fails to bolster euro By Christopher Swan and Adrienne Roberts The European Central Bank intervened in foreign exchange markets yesterday for the second consecutive trading day emphasising its determination to defend the currency The unilateral move by the bank initially drove the single currency almost a cent higher to But the impact was shortlived The release of figures indicating that growth is slowing both in the eurozone and in its biggest economy Germany pushed the euro back below the level at which it had started the day It finished in London at down from its close on Friday In Birmingham Romano Prodi president of the European Commission expressed full confidence in Wim Duisenberg chairman of the European Central Bank and insisted that the euro would recover more ground Sales of distressed assets by Japanese banks and other financial institutions to investors such as US hedge funds have unexpectedly slowed in recent months bankers and analysts say The decline is likely to raise new unease about the health of Japans financial industry and its slow progress in cleaning up the problems caused by the collapse of the countrys s bubble Some industry observers suspect that one reason for the slowdown is that falling Japanese share prices have eroded the banks capital and left them unwilling to make additional provisions for losses If the slowdown persists this could leave some foreign funds and banks reexamining their attempts to build a distresseddebt business in Japan Precise data on the distresseddebt market is not available because it is one of the most secretive sectors of Japans financial markets Derivatives Week November Corporates Caught Napping As Deadline For FAS looms A raft of corporates have delayed implementing the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement and are scrambling to meet the deadline which for most companies is Jan The big five have been warning people for years not to delay in figuring out how to implement FAS but a lot of people didnt listen said Rob Royall partner in the national accounting group at Ernst Young in New York Dilip Kumar partner at Arthur Andersen in New York added that billiondollar companies have been laggards in implementing the measure although he declined to name them We were worried that would happen said Bob Wilkins senior project manager in charge of FAS at the accounting standards board in Norwalk Conn He noted that the standard was originally slated to come into effect for fiscal years beginning after June Corporations concerned about digesting the bulky standard while also preparing for YK persuaded the FASB to push the deadline back to fiscal years beginning after June For most companies thats Jan Cynics here said that some companies would just let the standard sit on their bookshelves for another year he added The standard itself is daunting consisting of about pages plus pages of derivatives implementation group interpretations Ernst Youngs Royall said the whole document could balloon to pages by a year from now as hazy parts of the standard are cleared up Satish Rishi vp and assistant treasurer at Dell Computer in Austin Texas noted that his company has preparing for some time for the new standard and will be ready for it when the deadline arrives But he noted that companies that have not planned adequately are reaching a crunch point now ZD U AND

offers Gore and Bush derivatives Reuters November Sri Lanka Plans To Deregulate Broking Industry Sri Lanka plans to deregulate its broking industry and to allow for specialised brokers who will promote new risk instruments the director general of the Colombo Stock Exchange CSE said We are looking at the deregulation of the stock broking industry to allow free entry and exit Hiran Mendis told a forum of business leaders late on Thursday In the current system the CSE board advertises slots for broking licences and approves eligible applications We will allow brokers to do more investment banking margin lending and dealing on their own account and are also considering brokers doing their own underwriting Mendis said Brokers fees are too high due to the lack of diversification in activities Mendis said The CSE has been badly hit by an exodus of foreign equity capital this year due to an escalation in Sri Lankas ethnic war Average daily trading volumes were down to about million rupees last month half the volume from earlier this year The key Colombo all share index opened around on Friday up from the low of the year of in May but down from the years high of The CSE also plans to introduce derivatives shortselling and securities lending from around September At present Sri Lankas broking firms act only as agency brokers while having some leeway to extend margin lending facilities and to trade on their own account Mendis said brokers would also be allowed to segment their activities with some offering trading facilities and others clearing and settlement services We also hope to introduce Internet trading in the next threefour months Mendis added rupees Financial Times November Battle For The Benchmark Is On The French government bond market has benefited from the launch of the euro but possibly not as much as it might have liked to according to market strategists When the introduction of the European single currency did away with currency risk among the participating countries France set out to topple Germany from its position as the benchmark provider for the European government bond market Germany has maintained that position mainly as a result of the strength of its currency the DMark as well as the reputation of its central bank the Bundesbank But with the first no longer an independent entity and the second stripped of its monetary policy remit the battle for providing the new eurozone benchmark has been thrown open So far the outcome is inconclusive Market participants praise the French government debt agency France Tresor for its transparent information policy and efficient debt management at a time when falling budget deficits and windfall earnings from the sale of mobile phone licenses are reducing European governments need to borrow It is certainly the case that the information policy of France Tresor is better than that of the various bodies in Germany says Daniel Pfandler bond strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson But Germany remains the benchmark in and year issues whereas in the twoand fiveyear maturities one could argue that France is ahead Frances deficit is expected to fall to per cent of gross domestic product next year excluding the projected receipts from UMTS mobile licences Including those receipts France expects a small surplus However there should be little impact on bond issuance as UMTS receipts expected to amount to some Euros bn are spread over several years France has also embarked on an active debt management programme in order to boost liquidity even as financing requirements fall That includes the activities of agencies such as the Caisse dAmortissement de la Dette Sociale which refinances the debt of Frances social security system and will continue to be active in the market But although France has emerged as the leading European issuer in some maturities and some types of bonds many investors especially outside the eurozone continue to regard Germany as the point of reference for eurodenominated government bonds Germanys competitive advantage in the year maturities is underpinned by the liquidity in the Bund futures market on Eurex the SwissGerman derivatives exchange which is perceived as the European market leader But the French policy of releasing issuance schedules up to a year in advance with bond auctions held regularly every month is seen as superior to Germanys quarterly schedules France has also traditionally provided a more regular supply of liquid issues over the whole range of maturities from to year bonds France has always had liquid issuances spread much more evenly across the whole of the yield curve says Nathalie Fillet bond strategist at BNP Paribas The fiveyear BTAN is now widely regarded as the benchmark trading at the same or a slightly lower yield than its German counterpart the Bobl France has also led the way in launching the first eurodenominated index linked bond known as OATi and runs the most developed market for strippable government bonds which can be split into their component parts of coupons and principal Even so French bonds in parts of the yield curve still trade at a spread over the German governments Bunds meaning that France is borrowing at a more expensive interest rate than Germany The French curve offers more steady large issuances it is very transparent and from the French Tresors point of view that should certainly be producing narrower spreads says Padhraic Garvey senior bond strategist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam But the French curve is regarded as a spread product because the German market is seen as the anchor to the system for historic reasons Mr Garvey said that this year spreads between German bunds and other European government bonds have widened as a result of increasing worries in the market over the quality of European monetary union Those fears were exacerbated by the relentless slide of the euro on the foreign exchange markets Greeces decision to join the euro next year while Denmark has decided to stay out has further shaken investor confidence The launch of euro notes and coins in is likely to help allay fears that monetary union could break up and that is likely to produce tighter spreads between European government bonds The Hindustan Times November Swiss bank offers Gore and Bush derivatives A SWISS bank is offering

Derivatives Act Investment Instrument Standards Fight Grows Derivatives Standards Need Check Osaka and Dow To Form Derivatives Alliance Australia Credit Derivatives Turnover At AB Powerful Financial Services Reform Body Urged Lamfalussy group sees the way to a golden future for an integrated market Few issuers expected for first SET index options Acceptance hinges on Derivatives Act Bangkok Post SET options will be the first derivative index launched on the Stock Exchange of Thailand next year as a new riskmanagement tool for investors But a lack of firms willing to issue index options remains a challenge Regulators will allow the issue of both call and put options based on index changes A buyer of a call option for instance will receive payment for the difference in the change of the index if it rises above a set level Similarly a buyer of a put option is paid if the index falls Suvit Mapaisansin managing director of Merrill Lynch Phatra Securities said index options would become an important riskmanagement tool In overseas markets most regulators choose to develop a futures market first to support derivative instruments While Thailand plans to eventually develop a futures market final passage of a new Derivatives Act is needed first Mr Suvit said both futures and options were needed to enable investors to fully manage their risk The SET has sort of moved backward developing options before futures Under such circumstances the market will have only buyers with few sellers The sentiment for market trends will be similar both for puts and calls Brokers would likely serve as intermediaries in processing orders rather than taking positions themselves to limit their own risks Mr Suvit said I think there is interest among investors in the instruments but the problem is that there are no issuers yet Full development of options would likely await the launch of the futures market How successful derivative instruments become will hinge on overall investment sentiment SET officials acknowledge that the lack of issuers poses problems The draft Derivatives Act is being reviewed by the Council of State and then will be scrutinised by various agencies before final submission to Parliament Investment Instrument Standards Fight Grows Australian Financial Review By Roger Hogan The controversy over how Australian companies should account for financial instruments is likely to intensify during the next few weeks when a joint working group set up by the Australian Accounting Standards Board releases a draft document designed to settle the question According to the AASBs chairman Mr Keith Alfredson the document on which comments will be invited is likely to blow the minds of many in the financial markets major corporates and the accounting profession judging by the criticisms it has attracted even before its publication But he said time for argument was fast running out Whatever happened after the draft and invitation to comment were issued in the runup to Christmas Australia will have to make a choice Accounting bodies worldwide have been working on standards for financial instruments to prevent the derivatives related disasters that rocked many companies during the late s and early s including US company Procter Gamble which lost US million on interestrate derivatives in The matter has become urgent in Australia partly because the United States has introduced its own standard Financial Accounting Standard Board statement No which became effective for some companies on July and which will operate from January for those whose financial years coincide with the calendar FAS is regarded as a nightmare by corporate treasurers in the US and here because it requires derivatives and other financial instruments to be marked to market every quarter rather than accounted for on a fairvalue basis Its critics claim it will lead to volatility and confusion in company financial statements Mr Alfredson said that in the US there is now a special interpretation group like the Urgent Issues Group here interpreting In other words it is so complex readers cant just read the standard and interpret it The group has already issued more than interpretations Australia has no accounting standard that deals comprehensively with the recognition and measurement of financial instruments although it has made progress with disclosure requirements Acknowledging the concern over the marktomarket approach the AASB commissioned the development of a fairvalue model The joint working group consists of representatives from Australia Canada France Germany New Zealand the Nordic countries Britain the US and the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC has incorporated elements of FAS into its own muchcriticised financial instruments standard IAS It remains to be seen how much simpler the fairvalue approach will be In fairvalue accounting you get the market value for the instruments at the time and fair value them It sounds easy in principle but it is much more complicated in practice Mr Alfredson said Developing the appropriate standard is only half the battle however the trick is to gain widespread acceptance for it Even if Australia accepted the fairvalue model Mr Alfredson said it would not be able to implement it alone at least if I have any influence There would need to be a convergence by the major standardsetters after appropriate due processes including field testing of its relevance and reliability to preparers and users Either that or we may have to go to something else Perhaps FAS and all its committees Derivatives Standards Need Check Australian Financial Review By Roger Hogan The Bank for International Settlements will indirectly highlight the need for appropriate accounting standards for derivatives today when it releases statistics showing global overthecounter derivatives markets continue to grow strongly with total notional outstandings for the first half of the year at US trillion trillion This represents a per cent increase on the US billion at December and reflects an overall buoyancy of the market which contrasts sharply with the stagnation of volumes on derivatives exchanges The notional value of exchangetraded contracts during the first half was US trillion the same as December Another trend picked out by the BIS data is the rise of the euro as a key currency in the derivatives market It extended its already dominant position in the interest rate derivatives markets where it accounted for the equivalent of US trillion or per cent of the total compared with US trillion per cent in the previous period Growth during the first half was led by forwardtype contracts particularly interest rate swaps outright forwards and foreign exchange swaps said the BIS The biggest segment interest rate derivatives grew by per cent to US trillion Most of the growth was in swaps which expanded percent to US trillion Swaps have grown more quickly than other interest rate derivatives for the past few years a trend the BIS said might be explained by the development of various swap structures which might have enabled the market to respond to endusers needs in a more flexible way than exchangetraded interest derivatives Other reasons included the introduction of the euro and its stimulus to the growth of European capital markets issuance some exposure to which was likely to have been hedged in the interest rate swap market and reduced government bond issuance which would have made government bond futures less useful as hedging instruments Not surprisingly given the currency volatility during the first half the value of contracts outstanding in various currency instruments increased per cent to US trillion This included a very sharp per cent rise in contracts involving the euro the value of US and sterling contracts rose and per cent respectively Activity in the equitylinked sector fell by per cent to US trillion while that in commodity derivatives markets increased by per cent to US billion Looking behind these face values the actual credit exposures of financial institutions to derivatives fell by per cent from US trillion to US billion Osaka and Dow To Form Derivatives Alliance Financial Times October By Bayan Rahman Osaka Securities Exchange Japans secondlargest stock exchange and Dow Jones Co the US index provider will on Thursday sign an agreement to list the US companys derivatives products on the OSE early next year Osaka will develop futures and options contracts whose value will be linked to the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Goro Tatsumi OSE president and David Moran president of Dow Jones Indexes will sign a memorandum of understanding in Osaka on Thursday The OSE is seeking derivativesrelated tieups to expand its range of global products to attract international clients The move is also designed to help the exchange defend its market share against the threat from hour and internet trading The agreement between the Osaka exchange and Dow Jones follows another one between the OSE and Nasdaq of the US to list derivatives products based on the Nasdaq index The OSE is also in talks with the Chicago Board Options Exchange and is considering talks with Eurex the SwissGerman derivatives exchange Australia Credit Derivatives Turnover At AB Dow Jones International News By Adam Bradbery SYDNEY Dow Jones The Australian credit derivatives market saw total turnover for the financial year of A billion up substantially from the Australian Financial Markets Association said Monday This is the first year the AFMA has surveyed the credit derivatives market but it estimates turnover was A billion to A billion in Credit derivatives are instruments that allow market participants to manage the credit risk within their assets or to take exposure to such risk to boost returns This shows that the market has liquidity and depth said AFMA credit derivatives committee chairman Pierre Katerdjian The findings are the result of a survey conducted by AFMA and the Securities Industry Research Centre of AsiaPacific Its very encouraging particularly as there are still a number of offshore banks and investment houses which trade Australian name default swaps but which were not captured by the AFMA survey Katerdjian said AFMA Chief Executive Ken Farrow says that the growth in the market is good for Australias lenders and helpful in lowering systemic risk in Australian financial markets Katerdjian says most market participants expect turnover of credit derivatives to increase this financial year from last year with the global reduction in government debt on issue and the increased liquidity of corporate bond markets encouraging this trend There is a greater need to hedge credit risk and these instruments are the most efficient way to do that he said Powerful Financial Services Reform Body Urged Financial Times November By Peter Norman The European Union needs a powerful new EU securities committee to help speed regulatory reform In markets for financial services and capital a special EU group on securities regulation proposed yesterday The group rejected the idea of a single EU regulatory agency at his stage of the development of the EUs securities markets This idea which would require changes to EU treaties gained little support from market practitioners But Alexandre Lamfalussy the former Belgian central banker who chaired the so called wise mens group urged EU leaders at next Marchs summit in Stockholm to agree to proposals for a new faster method of regulatory reform and make commitments for it to be in place in the EU by We can no longer afford the luxury of regulatory inefficiency in the instantaneous internet age declared Mr Lamfalussy Financial markets are changing by the week and European regulation is simply not up to speed The report said an efficient regulatory process for financial services and capital markets was crucial for the EU and its citizens because it would boost growth competitiveness and jobs Mr Lamfalussy said the proposed system which would have the securities committee work out the detailed implementation of new regulations could cut the time needed to complete reforms substantially and possibly by a half The committee which would consist of representatives of the Commission and member states would be able to adapt existing legislation to changed circumstances very quickly he added Mr Lamfalussy made clear that the fast track system being proposed would have to be monitored carefully and reviewed promptly if found to be manifestly failing to secure progress The interim report was welcomed by representatives of the financial sector Some bankers said it was auspicious that the final recommendations would be delivered in February during EU presidency of Sweden which is known to favour speeding the development of the single financial market Adam Ridley direcxtor general of the London Investment Banking Association said the report proposed a sensible institutional structure He welcomed the decision to initiate a wide debate on the proposals before production of the groups final report Paul Ariman the secretary general of the Federation of European Stock Exchanges praised the reports very pragmatic approach noting that it would have taken at least three years to set up a single European regulator Mr Lamfalussy said regulatory changes were especially urgent if the EU was to create a real single market for financial services He endorsed the proposals of the EUs financial services action plan but urged that it be completed by The present target of could be missed unless the EU adopted the groups fast track approach on legislation he warned Lamfalussy group sees the way to a golden future for an integrated market Financial Times By Peter Norman The average US investment fund is six times larger than its European equivalent Venture capital per head of population in the European Union is onefifth of US levels The average annual real return on US pension funds was per cent between and against percent in the EU With these facts Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy and his group of wise men highlighted the deficiencies of the EUs financial market in yesterdays interim report on the regulation of European securities markets The prize of creating a properly integrated European financial services and capital market that would virtually complete the EUs single market for goods and services was couched in correspondingly glittering terms Financial market integration Mr Lamfalussy said would lead to increased productivity of both capital and labour enabling the Europes economy to grow faster and create more jobs It would bring benefits to consumers through higher returns to small and mediumsized enterprises through more venture capital and to large companies through lower capital costs The reforms needed to create such a market have long been identified and cover issues such as new rules for regulated and non regulated markets a single passport to ease the raising of capital across borders and updating investment rules for pension and investment funds They form the EUs financial services action plan due to be implemented by but which the Lamfalussy group wants completed by The problem so far has been putting in place the regulatory conditions to police such a market in a period of rapid technological and market change As Mr Lamfalussys report recalled it takes an average three years to agree an EU regulation or directive and delays can be much longer The EU takeover directive has been under discussion for years and still to be enacted The report called for a regulatory system that can adjust continuously flexibly and rapidly to future developments which are unpredictable today It must not inhibit legitimate market development and be neu tral as regards competition between different service providers The current system Mr Lamfalussy complained is too slow too rigid and contains too much ambiguity and inconsistent implementation The novelty of yesterdays report is in the way it draws on a little used element of the EUs legislative procedure to propose a faster way of introducing and implementing legislation governing financial markets At first sight its four level approach for securities legislation appears technical and undramatic But by using the process known as comitology it offers a chance of halving the time needed to introduce financial market rules Mr Lamfalussys group proposed that future EU securities legislation should concentrate on principles rather than details The legislation which would be agreed in the usual way by the council of ministers and the European parliament on a proposal of the Commission would ideally be framed as EU regulations which do not require transposing into national law A new EU securities committee would define how these principles would be implemented It would comprise Commission officials and representatives of member states who would decide technical details and update them when necessary EU member states would be responsible for implementing the legislation ensuring that it was consistent and equivalent throughout the KU This would entail much greater cooperation between regulators and the Commission The attraction of the plan is that it could be enacted without changing the EU treaties and in force by the beginning of It would be closely monitored and reviewed around However Mr Lamfalussy made clear the new procedure would need political endorsement at the highest level and suggested EU leaders at their Stockholm summit in March next year should pass a resolution agreeing a series of commitments to be delivered by His fast track method would also have to win the support of the European parliament which has adopted a generally hostile approach to comitology because it pares its powers Stressing that yesterdays report was an interim proposal Mr Lamfalussy said his group would now seek political and market reactions End of ISDA Press Report for Thursday November THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE

Commodities Laws In Legislative Limbo AG Subcommittee Candidate Raises Eyebrows SFE Cleared To Sell In US Markets Digest Levitts Options Penny Postulation Too Pricey Reform Of Investment Rules Urged Financial Times November The European Commission is pressing for a radical overhaul of its investment rules to keep up with the accelerating pace of change in securities markets and to encourage more crossborder trade Frits Bolkestein the EUs single market commissioner will launch a widespread consultation process on Thursday to discuss the changes needed to the EUs investment services rules The update of the EUs investment services legislation is one of the top priorities set by the Commission for its financial services work in the next six months EU heads of government want to complete the integration of the financial market by as part of the drive to improve competitiveness Financial services accounts for per cent of EU gross domestic product and this is expected to grow rapidly as the euro and new technology lead to a more integrated capital market Part of the drive to overhaul the investment legislation is the Commissions recognition that its single passport rules allowing a firm to sell investment services across the EU as long as it complies with supervisory rules in its home country do not work well in practice This is because too many countries impose their own additional specifically local restrictions in the name of investor protection The Commission now wants to ensure that home country rule is enforced for all professional investors such as pension funds and other institutions and any local restrictions removed National supervisors may still impose some restrictions on services provided to retail investors but these should be kept to a minimum This involves countries agreeing on a common definition for a professional investor generally an institution But sophisticated individual investors can also apply to be treated as professionals if they have enough experience and a large portfolio Mr Bolkestein also wants to stimulate discussion among countries about how to achieve more common regulation of markets and trading systems including new electronic trading arrangements It is vital for the Commission to address the discrepancies in regulation between different markets There is a danger that EU rules will not keep up with the growing number of mergers between securities exchanges and the development of electronic marketplaces that are used across borders The consultation exercise will take place until March next year after which the Commission will legislate US Election Has New Commodities Laws In Legislative Limbo Dow Jones News Service November By Dawn Kopecki Like everything else in Washington these days the push for new US commodities laws is stuck in legislative limbo with an unresolved presidential election and an undetermined end to the congressional session Lawmakers were expected to finish outstanding budget work and a handful of policy bills by the end of this week But they decided Monday to suspend all legislative action for the next three weeks returning to work in early December At some point or another we have to do our job But its very hard to do when the election isnt settled said Sen Phil Gramm RTexas The Senate Banking Chairman who objects to the commodities legislation being considered in the Senate didnt rule out anything regarding new derivatives laws or bankruptcy rules Tuesday He spoke with reporters after the Senate GOPs weekly policy lunch Theres still a lot here to be done Gramm said responding to a question about the commodities bill and possible bankruptcy laws There are a lot of things that could happen Senate Agriculture Chairman Richard Lugar RInd hasnt yet decided whether he will push legislation that merely extends current commodities laws or press Senate leaders to pass the House bill that overhauls the laws that oversee the trillion derivatives industry There are so many things up in the air said Senate Agriculture spokeswoman Tiffany Steele Lugar has said in the past that he could bring up the commodities bill that passed the House over Gramms objections and attach it to a federal spending bill before Congress adjourns for the year Thats one of the options being considered Steele said The House bill excludes OTC contracts from US commodities laws eases regulations for US futures exchanges and lifts the year ban on singlestock futures The most recent statistics available placed the total estimated worldwide notional value of outstanding overthecounter derivatives contracts at trillion at the end of June according to the Bank for International Settlements Ag Subcommittee Candidate Raises Eyebrows Wall Street Letter November By Dan Freed One of the more interesting possibilities in the forthcoming appointment of new committee leadership positions in the House of Representatives in the wake of last weeks elections which has thus far escaped the notice of many in Washington involves a subcommittee chairmanship and a crucial piece of legislation A number of committee leadership positions that are critical to the interests of Wall Street are still considered to be open Nick Smith RMichigan was one of only four members of the House of Representatives who voted against the Commodity Futures Modernization Act last month Nevertheless Smith is in the running to be appointed chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee for Risk Management Research and Specialty Crops which wrote the legislation If the bill which would overhaul commodity trading regulations doesnt pass Congress this year Smith could well find himself responsible for writing the next one A spokesman for Smith did not provide an explanation for the congressmans vote by press time and he had no comment on whether Smith would pursue the subcommittee chairmanship One lobbyist could not explain Smiths vote but suggested that the congressman didnt have a solid understanding of the issues surrounding the legislation Hes very strange He attends most of the hearings but he zeroes in on things that dont matter to many people delivery points with Chicago Board of Trade grain contracts People in the audience snicker when he asks questions The lobbyist conceded however that Smith is always open to listening to everyones concerns The Smith spokesman did not return a call requesting a response to these comments Another lobbyist was less critical pointing out that CBOT delivery points are an important issue for Smiths constituents as well as others in his region The first lobbyist doubted that Smith would get the chairmanship and seconded a House staff members guess that the post would go to Frank Lucas itOklahoma who represents both energy and agricultural interests giving him ties to the futures and overthecounter communities Other possibilities are John Boehner itOhio and Terry Everett RAlabama Full Committee chairmanships said to be still undetermined in the House include the two principal financial industry oversight committees Banking and Commerce Marge Roukema RNew Jersey has seniority in the Banking Committee but Richard Baker RLouisiana is considered a contender Michael Oxley ROhio has also been rumored as a possible Banking chairman though he announced his candidacy for the Commerce position last week WJ Billy Tauzin RLouisiana has also staked a claim to Commerce and his battle with Oxley which has flared up in public on occasion will be interesting to watch Chairmanship of the House Ways and Means committee which is responsible for tax issues is also in question Either Philip Crane RIllinois or William Thomas RCalifornia could get the nod SFE Cleared To Sell In US Markets Digest Financial Times November SFE cleared to sell in US The Sydney Futures Exchange said yesterday it was now permitted to directly offer its stock futures and options contracts to US customers The exchange said it had obtained authorisation from US regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and its Share Price Index products were now available to customers globally Introduced in May the SPI futures and options are based on the SPASX index the new benchmark equity index for Australian markets SFEs interest rate and commodity products are already available for trading to customers worldwide Meanwhile the Australian Derivatives Exchange ADX said yesterday it was confident it would be able to open for business within weeks and a firm launch date would be announced as soon as possible The ADX said it believed it was in the final stages of satisfying the information and documentation requirements of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission which was in the process of assessing the exchanges market application Originally scheduled to be launched on October the ADX had postponed its launch date to the middle of November saying more time was required to complete the regulatory process ADX is intended to be a fully electronic derivatives exchange with a global focus Levitts Options Penny Postulation Too Pricey Wall Street Letter November Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitts recent suggestion that the Commission may ban trading and quoting of options contracts in increments larger than a penny has drawn considerable skepticism from a market data expert who said that trading options in pennies would cause a tremendous strain on industry information systems Leo McBlain who chairs the Financial Information Forum an industry organization devoted to information systems matters said that were the Commission to mandate that options trade in pennies it could conceivably cause some firms to choose to abandon the product altogether if they determined that the cost of bringing systems up to speed outweighed the revenue it generated During a speech delivered just over a week ago at the Fordham Law School in New York City Levitt suggested that the Commission might mandate penny increments for options just as it has for stocks McBlain explained that one equity stock can generate as many as options contracts due to different information about prices and expiration dates He noted that options data already accounts for roughly of all market data generated in North America Increasing the number of options pricing possibilities by five or times could generate far more message traffic than current systems can handle Updating those systems could be tremendously costly he said though he wasnt aware that any cost estimates have been made thus far John Panchery who heads the Securities Industry Associations decimals conversion project said that industry attention is still focused on ensuring that it will be able to handle the additional message traffic that will be generated when Nasdaq converts to decimals in the spring He said it was too early to say whether trading options in pennies within a year was an unrealistic goal or whether such a mandate from the SEC might cause some firms to choose not to trade options An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment noting only that Levitt said in his speech that he did not underestimate the technological and regulatory challenges options markets face End of ISDA Press Report for Wednesday November THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED

Derivatives Trade Darts Up In November A Treasury Management ASP for FASB and Beyond The Slow Death Of The FX Salesman New Derivative Squeezes Power Out Of Bottlenecks Dow Jones International News November By Michael Young As the deregulated Nordic power market plugs into new regions an electrical shortcircuit has set off trading in a new derivative Price differences that arise from bottlenecks in the Nordic regions power grid capacity has led the local electricity bourse Nordpool to launch a new category of derivative Contracts for Difference with hedgers and speculators keen to give it a go I think they could easily make some headway into the market and we intend to trade them thats for certain said Allan Toft Hansen power trader at Elsam one of the largest Danish power producers A large proportion of electricity in the Nordic area is traded on the Nordpool exchange the worlds first international commodity exchange for electrical power The bourse matches power producers and power wholesalers setting Nordicwide prices for each hour of the following hour day Also power derivatives such as futures and options are traded and with the contracts for difference a new third type of financial instrument is to be bought and sold Demand for this new type of derivative contract came from price anomalies between the Nordic electricity regions price differences that are the result of bottlenecks in the power grids capacity Nordpool started the new contracts on Nov and in the first week a total of gigawatts hours were traded This was bigger turnover than we expected said Hartvig Munthe Kaas head of corporate communications at Nordpool He added that he was optimistic about turnover developing in coming months although he declined to put a figure on it It is a tool for alleviating a situation where you have different area prices for the same product Kaas added Capacity limits on the power lines may cause for example a predominantly coalpowered western Denmark region to be priced higher than a region in Norway where full reservoirs for hydroelectric plants allow supercheap electricity to stream out of the turbines As a result producers and distributors face uncertainty as to whether their region will be served with the lowest price The contracts for difference allow market players to hedge against or take on the risk of these regional price differences Paradoxically the need for a market in contracts for difference increased with the success of the Nordpool pricing system which was originally designed to ensure more homogeneous pricing for different regions As electricity markets integrate through advanced market systems the grid capacity is overloaded between coalpowered producers with one set of prices and hydropowered producers with another The contracts will become more and more usual the more that hydrogenerated power integrates with coalgenerated power says Flemming Loekke who heads power trading at Danish company Elektra Energihandel And with moves to integrate Nordic and German electricity planned more exchange trading in contracts for difference will plug the price gaps between coal and hydropower he says With the Scandinavian power trading exchanges being increasingly integrated with other exchanges in northern Europe demand for an instrument to avoid or take on the risk of price anomalies through the bourse may increase If spot prices differ on the same market then indeed there is room for more use of this instrument said Nordpools Kaas But some market dealers are doubtful about the prospects for a derivative that allows some producers with inside information on grid capacity to make gains while those less fortunate bear the risk I am skeptical Some producers have access to privileged information and this could give them market power said Jon Ove Heen a trader at the Norwegian power company Interkraft Derivatives Trade Darts Up In November Our Markets Bureau November Total volumes in the derivatives segment of the Bombay Stock Exchange BSE witnessed an increase of per cent till November to Rs crore from contracts compared with Rs crore from contracts in October The National Stock Exchange NSE also saw a jump in the trading volume in its derivatives segment at Rs crore from contracts till November against Rs crore from contracts in October Manoj Vaish deputy executive director BSE said We expect the derivatives segment to witness a daily trading volume of Rs crore by March Derivatives trading started in June with a modest volume of Rs crore from contracts on the BSE and Rs crore from contracts on the NSE In July on the BSE the volume moved up to Rs crore contracts On the NSE the volume increased to Rs crore contracts Since then the trading volume in the segment has been gradually improving despite the fact that most institutional players are not much active in the segment Analysts point out that another major hurdle in the derivatives sector is the lack of a pricing mechanism for contracts Normally pricing of derivatives is dependent on the interest rates in the country and there are arbitrage opportunities across the debt derivatives and equity markets In the absence of a debt market no proper pricing mechanism has been established yet in the country Arbitrage opportunities are essential for the healthy development of the capital market and today we only have speculators in this segment as hedging is virtually absent owing to the absence of index funds Also arbitrage cannot be done because there is no debt market in the country So only speculation can be done and no market can be developed with mere speculators Hence institutional presence in the derivatives market will take time analysts said Meanwhile the BSE has received new applications for limited trading membership in the derivatives segment This is in addition to the regular members A Treasury Management ASP for FASB and Beyond Derivatives Strategy October By Robert Hunter The implementation date for Financial Accounting Standard was pushed back so many times that corporate treasurers and accountants alike began hoping the elephant in the living room would just go away But now that its finally a reality theyre scrambling to apply the complex rules to flesh and blood accounting reports In spite of the long delays a surprisingly small number of vendors offer products that can even charitably be considered FAS compliant All of which is good news for Revalcom an application service provider trying to bridge the chasm in FAS compliant treasury management systems Reval bills itself as the only Internetbased treasury management system that addresses FAS in any kind of comprehensive way I think its a misnomer for any software company including Reval to say that its FAS compliant says Jiro Okochi CEO and cofounder of Reval The company not the vendor needs to be compliant and its our job to simplify and clarify this task Some vendors may be misleading the end user into thinking that purchasing their software automatically solves all of the companys FAS issues and that is wrong The companys ultimate goal is to help corporate treasurers at Fortune and middlemarket companies centralize their disparate patchwork of treasury management systems and avoid the manually intensive processing associated with these trades by warehousing financial data on the Internet At the moment highfunctionality treasury systems are quite pricey while cheaper systems cover only the generic vanilla structures Reval hopes to fill this gap by offering an affordable webbased solution that covers a broad range of asset classes including derivatives Of course product coverage isnt the only problem facing treasury systems trying to deal with Even if a package accommodated every financial product known to man the Big Five accounting firms each have their own interpretation of the standard and these views may contradict each other Moreover since the Financial Accounting Standards Board is still dealing with Derivatives Implementation Group issues FAS accounting remains a moving target By offering an Internetbased solution instead of a standalone system Reval can adapt to evolutionary changes as decisions are made Simple webbased systems with their common interfaces and unlimited scalability are dearly the wave of the future if not the present But true derivatives functionality is still rare in treasury ASPs and therein lies Revals opportunity For the bigger companies says Okochi were not going to be immediately accepted as a stand alone systems alternative Were going to have to prove ourselves to them Well do this by starting with a derivatives and FAS specialization As people gain awareness and comfort with Revals accomplishments in delivering these sophisticated tasks via an ASP model theyll subscribe to more of our treasury functions across the board Under the new standards all derivatives are markedtomarket on the balance sheet The main challenge for treasurers is to find an underlying hedged item that can also be markedtomarket into earnings to offset the derivatives change in market value Any changes in value that dont match are deemed ineffective and are reflected in a companys earnings As a rule of thumb no one wants variability in derivatives positions to affect earnings As an alternative however a company can try to prove that a derivative hedges a variable cash flow in which case it can be recorded as other comprehensive income OCI directly on the balance sheet with no earnings impact What does this mean for treasury systems In the good old days a company that issued debt could rely on a simple system that monitored the debt portfolio with an entirely separate derivatives accounting function handling the accompanying swap Some bigger companies of course boasted systems that could monitor price and riskmanage the derivative portfolio but such functionality was rare Now because hedges must be priced and tied to the underlying hedged items at an inception integrated derivatives accounting is more critical than ever To address this Reval plans to provide full marktomarket services including pricing models and independent thirdparty market data You can have the best and brightest stars write all the C algorithms you want says Okochi but unless you have good market data going into the models you wont generate a very good price Reval will also match hedges with underlying hedged items and track them throughout their lives as FAS requires The Slow Death Of The FX Salesman Derivatives Strategy October By Barclay T Leib When new technology first started eating up jobs at foreign exchange voice brokers like Garban Intercapital and Cantor Fitzgerald it didnt take long for foreign exchange salespeople at dealer firms to figure out that they were next on the menu The foreign exchange world a huge geographically disperse but ultimately simple twoway market that depends mostly on the speed of executionwas a natural to go electronic And today electronic systems most notably the Electronic Broking Services platform dominate the interbank foreign exchange markets EBS itself now captures more than percent of the daily inter bank trading volume Traditional voice brokers in cash are all but dead Add the Internet age and the pressure only gets worse A dizzying array of new foreign exchange trading platforms such as FXallcom Atriaxcom Currenex and CFOWebcom promise that theyll soon allow clients to do everything from research to execution on the web leaving little room for the humans to work Meanwhile bidoffer spreads are shrinking quicker than a waif model for Calvin Klein The official line from the banks even as they go electronic is that theres still an important role for salespeople to play Good salespeople are still essential to cement client dealing relationships they say What salespeople might lose in spread revenue moreover can be made up by revenue from greater volume and sales of structured products Banks even say that electronic trading is a good thing for the salesfolks The more sales and trades done electronically the more time salespeople have to analyze markets and cook up profitable sophisticated hedging strategies It also means they have more time to prospect for new clients which should be great news for the salespeople Who wants to be stuck in the office with five telephones on two ears when you could be out wining and dining But does anyone really believe that Do the banks have a truly cogent game plan to sort all this out At the very least what new qualities must salespeople now possess to hold down a job Given that foreign exchange is ahead of other capital markets in its use of electronic price delivery the answer to these questions could set the tone for the future of all Wall Street salespeople So listen carefully I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW First it is important to put things in perspective What exactly are the facts for foreign sales staffs Fact one The recent spate of bank megamergers means that fewer banks are trading foreign exchange Moreover big banks seem to be getting bigger and more powerful in this area while the small ones are slowly falling by the wayside Banks like KBC Deutscheland Daiwa and Nikko have all dosed their spot foreign exchange trading in London SGCowen New York has laid off part of its corporate sales force and DG Bank recently shut down foreign exchange trading in New York At the same time after aggressively re cruising new salespeople in Deutsche Bank has stolen market share even from the likes of UBS Warburg and JP Morgan The latter institutions reported lower foreign ex change volumes and profitability during the year and specifically cited foreign exchange as an overall drag on their corporate profitability JPMorgan will soon be folded into Chase and a nascent foreign exchange effort at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette will soon be absorbed into Credit Suisse First Boston According to headhunters resumes from both Morgan and DLJ have already hit the street In short the number of bank players is down and bank foreign exchange volumes have been static to slightly lower in the year Fact two Since the introduction of the euro last year there are fewer currencies to trade In the words of Adam Sorab a former Londonbased foreign exchange salesman at CSFB The Rubix cube of currency risk management has been reduced to a much simpler matchtheshape type puzzle With no more lira peseta or other fringeEuropean currencies to worry about risk management has generally become simpler Without fringe currencies to worry about and trade many previously spreadable opportunities for the banks have also flown out the window Fact three There are fewer customers Large macro hedge fund managers and commercial speculators have for a variety of reasons stopped trading the way they used to This may have more to do with losses in other macro bets gone awry in equity markets and elsewhere as opposed to problems within the foreign exchange market itself But for whatever reason it is making the business a tougher one for salespeople According to one Londonbased salesperson The foreign exchange market used to have three prongs to it the hedge funds the commercial speculative community and the commercial hedging community Now with the demise of Tiger Management and the downsizing of George Soros Quantum Fund some of the biggest clients have simply disappeared Speculative commercial accounts such as French corporates Batif Aerospatiale and Thompson have also largely stopped trading in the aggressive style of yesteryear This still leaves the commercial hedgers with simple tradeflow repatriation but foreign exchange in general is now a much lonelier and thinner market The only recent players with any stepup in activity are the banks doing oneoff hedging for large MA activities and global equity managers rebalancing their portfolios and currency exposures says this salesman If you dont see those flows youre dead Almost everyone else is gone Hes particularly incensed because the year has brought some goodsized moves in the market Weve gone from to in l the euro Deutsche markyen for us oldtimers has fallen off the charts to But nobody cares The hedge fund community is not around Its mindboggling Fact four Salary and bonus levels are stagnant Gone are the days of the megadeal with big guaranteed bonuses says Elaine de Flores president of the recruiting firm de Flores International in Stamford Conn Some guarantees are still given but its not like the old days You really have to produce put your money where your mouth is to get paid De Flores thoughts are echoed by foreign exchange recruiting specialist Kenny Blonder senior vice president of Integrated Management Resources in Tempe Ariz Salary levels have been flat he says The highest paid salesperson might make tops as a base salary these days COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS So whats the good news Well salespeople may be surviving better than some traders are Blonder says that in the last two years hes placed strategists economists quantitative people and a few salespeople but he hasnt been able to place a single currency trader during that time Ecommerce and the EBS may be even tougher on the traders than the salespeople says Blonder No one calls out to do spot business anymore Volume is just done on the machine With the new platforms one guy can watch more currencies at the same time You dont need hoards of trading staff Having said that there are still two factors keeping demand for salespeople firm for now First according to de Flores banks still want a few rainmakers who bring a book of clients with them when changing firms All recruiters are looking for the same person she says He or she must have a loyal customer base that is transferable and must be wellversed in derivatives and other markets as well as foreign exchange The interview process has also grown lengthier and fussier Banks want to see more people So while theres still a demand its not easy to dose a deal The second factor is ironically excessive and premature pessimism over the future of the business A New York foreign exchange salesperson notes that Because the death bells of this business were rung so loudly and so early no fresh new blood has come into foreign exchange for three or four years maybe longer Unfortunately he does not think this will help over the long term I dont think were all going to die but I think we will be in a reducedsalary advisory role he says I certainly cant promise to bring anyone a given amount of turnover and profitability anymore The business no longer works that way LOOKING FOR THE PATH OUT Given all of the above what is the average foreign exchange salesperson or trader supposed to do The threadbare spreads are prompting a lot of people to contemplate switching careers Up to two years ago I could make million in spread revenue for my institution in a good year says one salesman at a UKbased bank This year Ill be lucky to make million Thats still enough to keep my job but Im working harder now to take home far less money If something better came along Id take it De Flores confirms that this is the overall attitude I cant tell you how often I get a phone call from some foreign exchange person asking What do I do Where do I go How do I reinvent myself she says Women in particular are getting out of the business in droves taking the attitude that it is not worth it to come in day after day chasing the same small group of customers I dont mean to sound sexist at all but they are leaving the industry either to go home and take care of the kids or do something completely different sometimes in businesstobusiness commerce Theres really a dearth of women in the industry now Men unfortunately dont quite have that luxury of just packing it in More often they are forced to at least try sticking it out De Flores specifically says that many traders quarttypes and structurers inquire about the buy or equityside of the business Theyd be there in a heartbeat if I had more of these positions says de Flores But while business may be getting more difficult at the margin people are still holding onto their jobs for now mainly because no may be the worst time to jump ship to another firm As always its easier to fill a position going up the chain than down says Blonder People are always happy to step up to a Chase Citi or Goldman as opposed to moving down to a smaller bank But those making the step up know that if they dont perform once they get there they risk not having a seat anywhere at all WHERE TO GO To survive within the industry itself a foreign exchange salesperson today needs to know more than how to spread spot and forward foreign exchange trades Whats required is a strategic ability to transact orders in a variety of markets and to solve problems for clients using derivatives Threeway option deals are still going to require the human touch for quite awhile to come says one recruiter who is still bullish on the prospects for quality people within foreign currency sales Salespeople not capable of reinventing themselves also might find a niche selling the very technology that threatens them We may end up with two distinct groups of sales people muses Craig Puffenberger managing director in charge of foreign exchange trading at CSFB One handling complex trades and advisory functions while the other just services the portal In the meantime to those thinking of leaving the business altogether Ian Dow president of Dow Consultants in New York advises Youre going to have to reinvent yourself a bit retrain maybe take a pay cut According to Blonder There are jobs in ecommerce tech companies and foreign exchange trading software vendors and I have made a few placements there The only problem is that while many of these companies pay a competitive salary they usually dont come dose on a bonus basis Notwithstanding that caveat electronic trading platform Currenex has recently lured several first class veteran sales people to its offices hiring both Keith Hill from JP Morgans London office and Kendra Wisler formerly of UBS Warburg Perhaps stock options did the trick Others have found positions on the buyside Laura Munisteri a veteran foreign exchange trader options specialist and salesperson formerly of Deutsche Banks Frankfurt office joined the United Nations Common Fund in before moving in to join the global corporate treasury area at Philips AG Others have headed into consulting One individual with a strong foreign exchange and treasury background decided in that the time had come to hang up his sellside boots He started out as a senior consultant at a Big Five accounting firm and says hes never regretted the switch To make any real money as a consultant you have to become a partner he says And even though I did not have the credentials to come in at that level back then Im much closer to that objective now Ive taken my capitalmarkets expertise and been able to apply it to a whole slew of new businesses these days largely in the dotcoin world Others have gone into the regulatory agencies Ernest Eckersdorf who spent most of a sevenyear career at Citibank running corporate foreign exchange sales and then played a similar role at Societe Generale for eight years now acts as a supervising risk management specialist for the New York State Banking Department I get to see a wide crosssection of institutions from the top down he says It is actually quite enlightening and professionally its extremely satisfying There is simply no comparison between what I do now and the single lowmargin product that foreign exchange has become Meanwhile Sorab formerly of Credit Suisse foreign exchange sales leapt at an opportunity in when Credit Suisse and CS First Boston merged their foreign exchange efforts to shift his focus He moved into the hedge fund marketing and investor relations group of CSFBs leveraged funds group Four years later he is happy he did that Sorab is soon to become a director of European sales at Deutsche Asset Managements absolute returns group in London I still have a great many friends in foreign exchange and many of them are looking to get out if they can he says Lastly we find Christina Engelchor formerly a year ABN Amro foreign exchange salesperson now happily at home in Nagele The Netherlands with her fouryear old son Cees I enjoyed what I was doing for a long time says Engelchor But then the technology started getting better and the clients more astute Foreign exchange became too competitive Moneymaking opportunities were declining just as my personal priorities were changing Being a woman working in Europe within a maleoriented business also wasnt always particularly easy Sometimes I felt like I was the only female member of a European football team So there you have it The impending death of the foreign exchange salesman was predicted by some as early as and has been acknowledged by more and more since then Some banking models are less threatening see Wells Fargo Takes a Novel Approach Page and a good salesperson who can also act as a strategist and derivatives expert will likely survive But the very nature of ecommerce puts the pressure on the bottom line and as that pressure builds look for the sales community to change almost as much as the voice braking community has While banks are loathe to admit it shedding expensive foreign exchange sales staff and excess traders may be the only way they can survive and profit as etrading truly begins to burgeon Everyone has access to EBS now even if they are not supposed to says a European salesman The banks are themselves a major disservice by providing such transparency If this continues within two years all flow transaction will go from a companys corporate headquarters directly into an electronic system bypassing salesman The only exception will be very largesized trades and structured optionsoriented trading Its obvious were not necessary anymore agrees a Chicagobased salesperson as cheerily

<3631287.1075859665796.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,smarra@isda.org,2000-11-28 04:23:00,ISDA PRESS REPORT FOR TUESDAY NOVEMBER PRESS REPORT TUESDAY NOVEMBER Uneven Progress German Derivatives Legislation A Need For Change Now Rate Derivatives Is Top Performer Capital Concerns Enron To Expand Weather Derivatives Cover Uneven Progress Asia Risk November By Quentin Hills The derivatives markets across Asia continue to develop in terms of maturity and complexity However as has been the case over the past five years this development has been neither homogeneous or consistent Before considering the future landscape it is worth reviewing the various phases of the market during the last few years During the early to mid s the main activity comprised currency and interest rate transactions in the major currencies The market was dominated by a handful of foreign financial institutions while local currency business was limited and activity was for the most part evenly distributed throughout the region The regulatory environment was mixed and generally not well defined or comprehensive Increasingly during this period the transactions became more speculative in line with global trendsand the inevitable occurred in the first quarter of As interest rates quickly reversed de rose in February there were several wellpublicised losses both in the region and globally There were quick and adverse consequences on the derivatives markets Activity abruptly slowed speculative transactions ceased and financial institutions that had been active pulled back at least temporarily Globally the focus turned towards discipline and control and there was a flurry of new derivatives guidelines and regulations Asian regulators responded with new guidelines which largely followed international practice During this period the industry represented by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and regulators from all countries developed strong relationships These relationships continue to this day and result in increasing industry comments during the drafting of new regulations As derivatives markets began to recover players returned and new entrants emerged local currency markets developed strongly and endusers focused on risk management processes Nevertheless despite the lack of highly leveraged structures companies throughout the region continued to fund longterm local currency investments with shorter term foreign currency cheaper liabilities both in the cash markets and synthetic derivatives When the Asian Crisis struck the impact was severe and the toll heavy Apart from deals being unwound activity ceased and liquidity disappeared Since the crisis derivatives markets have recovered with a marked increase in activity although not to precrisis levels the return of market makers and the introduction of new products such as credit derivatives Going forward the market seems poised to resume strong growth as Asia emerges from this difficult period Breadth and depth of participants A consequence of the crisis was a sharp and significant fall in counterparty creditworthiness across the region and the withdrawal of many market makers This was particularly acute during the height of the crisis but is reversing as foreign banks once again become more active and local banks build their derivatives capabilities Corporate credit quality is slowly improving and a recent trend has been the increasing use of derivatives by financial institutions particularly local banks and fund managers This is expected to continue as more active portfolio management leads to a focus on yield enhancement and credit risk management Additionally there has been an ongoing mend among endusers of markedly improved understanding and use of derivatives in risk management Also noticeable is the broader application of new products For example local financial institutions are using credit derivatives to manage balance sheet risk strategically both for liabilities and assets This reflects the efficiencies available through the correct use of derivatives and increasing sophistication of endusers Domestic bond markets The emergence of domestic bond markets is having a positive impact on market development both directly and indirectly There is a direct impact where bond issues are swapped into a different currency in the case of foreign issuers accessing a market or interest rate where issuers wish to alter the interest rate basis Additionally the increased availability of instruments in the market and greater demand for product from investors is leading to new local currency products such as options on domestic interest rates and securities Regulatory convergence Finally derivatives regulation in the region has generally been somewhat mixed with some countries adopting a prescriptive approach and others a riskbased approach Prior to the Asian Crisis there was a trend towards convergence and harmonization with respect to regulation During the crisis however new regulatory initiatives were put on hold as countries managed larger and more pressing issues The response to the economic turmoil elicited different responses concerning currency convertibility Naturally where currency controls were imposed either in part or in full there was a direct adverse impact on the local derivatives market However in those countries where the response has been to keep markets open or even to restructure the local financial markets derivatives usage has rebounded quickly This in turn requires further regulatory consideration which has generally been in line with international standards Going forward it is reasonable to expect a mend towards regulatory harmonization and increasing adoption of international regulatory standards The derivatives markets in Asia have undergone dramatic changes over the last few years The markets themselves are far from homogeneous and significant progress has been made from a low base There has been continual progress as the number of users increases more products become available and regulations put in place to allow healthy market development Development has not been uniform across the region nor has it been consistent over time as evidenced by the setbacks brought about by the Asian Crisis Nevertheless the derivatives markets in Asia will continue to develop and mature as endusers grow in number and sophistication while the range of products continues to expand German Derivatives Legislation A Need For Change Now Derivatives Week November In a global economy it is essential that each country establish a transparent and efficient regulatory system for financial products To ensure market stability governments must also instill a high degree of confidence m the legal system In relation to overthecounter derivatives transactions these goals have not yet been fully achieved in Germany But with the forthcoming Fourth Financial Markets Enhancement Act Finanzmarktfrderungsgesetz there might be light at the end of the tunnel In this context it makes sense to look at a muchneeded change in the legal regulation of the so called Borsentermingeschaft ENFORCEABILITY Generally a party to a derivatives contract under German law could attempt to challenge the validity of the agreement by raising a statutory defense the gaming or betting defense sec of the Civil Code Burgerliches Gesetzbuch the margin defense sec of the Civil Code or the futures defense sec of the Exchange Act Borsengesetz However there are two ways to possibly avoid the threat of such defenses i the contract in question could qualify as a hedging transaction or ii as a so called exchange traded futures agreement Borsentermingeschaft HEDGING Under the hedging exception a derivatives transaction is valid enforceable and not subject to the gaming betting or margin defense either if it constitutes a hedge for both parties or if the transaction is a hedge for one party and if this party believes without negligence that the transaction constitutes a hedge for the other party as well The term hedge in this context covers microhedging strategies Whether this exception is also true with respect to macrohedging strategies is not entirely dear Modern legal authors tend not to use the term hedging exception anymore but more broadly refer to economically justified transactions BORSENTERMINGESCHAFTE According to the Exchange Act sec pare Borsentermingeschafte are binding on both parties if each party is a merchant and is either registered or not subject to registration because heit is a foreign resident or a public law entity or a professional defined as a person who at the time of the transaction or prior thereto traded in futures commercially or professionally or is permanently admitted to engage in exchangetrading If only one party qualifies under the relevant provision of the Exchange Act a futures transaction is enforceable only if one party is subject to statutory banking or exchange supervision be it in Germany or abroad and informs the other party in writing of the risks inherent in the derivatives transactions in question standardized information papers which pursuant to German Supreme Court Bundesterichtshof case law satisfy the requirements under the Exchange Act and were created by the industry federations of the German banks This technique of entering a valid agreement is commonly referred to as the information model and is subject to strict and ongoing form requirements In addition the transaction in question must qualify as a Borsentermingeschaft Unfortunately this term has never been statutorily defined but is intended to cover new types of transactions and has thus to be interpreted in a broad sense Moreover the Exchange Act was amended in to extend the privilege of its sec to transactions with a similar financial purpose as exchangetraded futures transactions Therefore today most types of financial commodity energy and credit derivatives whether stock exchange traded or OTC products are generally eligible for falling under sec of the Exchange Act Despite the vast amount of case law almost exclusively in the context of warrants on this matter there is still some uncertainty as to whether certain OTC derivatives qualify as Borsenterningeschdffe within the meaning of this provision RELIEF THE FOURTH FINANCIAL MARKETS ENHANCEMENT ACT It is however widely expectedor at least hoped that the forthcoming Fourth Financial Markets Enhancement Act will include the introduction of a statutory definition of Borsentermingeschafte A legislative initiative to define Borsentermingeschafte in concrete terms would be helpful not least because the German Supreme Court seems in its more recent judgments to have entirely given up the attempt to bring such transactions within its own traditional definition attempts and now lays emphasis only on the financial purpose necessary for qualification as a Borsentermingeschafte The term also requires clarification in light of recent amendments to the Securities Trading Act Wertpapierhandelsgesetz and the Banking Act Kreditwesengesetz implementing into German law the EC Investment Services Directive ISD and the EC Capital Adequacy Directive CAD which introduced the distinguishable supervisory law term derivative narrowly defined into the two acts The term Borsentermingeschaft is not used internationally it is specific to Germany Its conceptual scope is controvasial and the continuous development of new types of transactions requires a provision which is as comprehensive as possible For this reason it makes sense to find a legal definition which includes existing derivatives and can accommodate new developments Moreover the essential point of a derivative is the dependence of its price upon the development of its underlyings Securities moneymarket instruments currencies units of account interest rates or other yields as well as commodities power and precious metals may all be assets underlying derivatives transactions as defined in for example the Securities Trading Act and the Banking Act In addition the inclusion of other underlyings such as credit events weather developments traffic flows and environmental emissions would be desirable in order to ensure that here too validity defenses are essentially eliminated A broad definition of a Borsentermingeschafte would remedy the existing lack of public confidence in the law especially with regard to future developmentsand thus would enhance the status of Finanzplatz Deutschland The German banking associations and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association should be supported by all market participants in air attempts to convince the German legislator to make a broad definition of Borsentermingeschafte a reality as soon as possible Rate Derivatives Is Top Performer Australian Financial Review November By Bill McConnell An explosion in the use of interest rate derivatives particularly forward rate agreements and swaps has been the standout feature of Australian financial markets this year alongside strong growth in nongovernment debt securities However a slump in foreign exchange transactions resulted in an overall decline in total financial markets turnover The Australian Financial Markets Association in conjunction with the Securities Industry Research Centre of AsiaPacific released the results of its annual report on trading in Australian financial instruments yesterday The report detailed statistical results of Australian overthecounter and exchange traded market activity Traded contracts in Australian financial instruments totaled trillion with the bulk of trading taking place on overthecounter markets which contributed per cent of total market turnover The two markets to show substantial declines in trading activity were foreign exchange and options on futures with yearly volumes down per cent in FX markets and per cent in SFE traded options The fall in activity in currency trading the first since led to an overall decline in market turnover of per cent The total turnover on the Australian Stock Exchange options and direct equities was billion or a little over percent of total market volume But the meager contribution provided by equity markets masked an impressive per cent increase on volumes from levels last year and a per cent increase in exchange traded options Market capitalisation in the Australian sharemarket also increased by per cent to billion The report identified not only a growth in share trading but also a changing investor profile This growth in investor participation in the market does not mean larger volumes It also means there is a growing number of more experienced investors seeking a broader range of investment products In addition the growth in superannuation funds in Australia is placing greater demand on investment products The challenge for exchanges is to meet these growing demands But the top performer in Australian financial markets this year was interest rate derivatives Use of forward rate agreements more than doubled during the year to trillion making it the fastest growing market segment for the year Nongovernment debt securities repurchase agreements and swaps experienced growth in turnover between and percent Swap turnover has increased every year since data was first collected in Turnover in swap markets has increased each year for four years and that has been happening irrelevant of economic circumstances said Mr Gordon Axford chairman of the Swaps Committee This has been a function of greater use of capital markets and an increased borrowing requirement by the corporate sector requiring the use of swaps to hedge exposure Mr Ken Farrow chief executive officer of AFMA said it had been an astonishing turnaround by interest rate markets after FRA markets appeared to be in decline in The interest rate market was more volatile this year than last and that means there was greater underlying customer demand for interest rate hedging said Mr Farrow Trading in government debt securities fell for the fourth consecutive year and while the traded volumes fell by only per cent the trend suggests a creeping supply gap between government and corporate markets Corporate issuance has really come into its own said Mr Phil Coates AFMA debt capital markets committee chairman The market has advanced considerably People are very much in tune with what is on offer and we have seen the expansion of the corporate floating rate note market But Mr Brad Scott vicepresident head of fixed income credit research at Salomon Smith Barney said while the corporate bond market was of equal size to the semigovernment sector the liquidity of the government bond market still far outstripped the corporate market by a factor of more than three As funds inflow continues to outstrip demand deal sizes particularly in the triple B land will need to continue to increase to attract offshore demand and encourage broadbased turnover growth Similarly greater issue diversity and liquidity provided by global credit markets will continue to attract more interest from funds who have money to place and cant wait for the market to grow KEY POINTS Australian financial markets turnover was trillion for the year Turnover in forward rate agreements increased by percent the fastest growing market segment Foreign exchange trading fell per cent the first fall since Trading in government debt securities fell for the fourth consecutive year down per cent Capital Concerns Risk November By Oliver Bennett There are plenty of people who believed it would or should never happen But early next year regulators are expected to announce a tier one capital charge for operational risk Bankers who have worked closely with the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision say it is likely to recommend three different options for banking supervisors basic indicators that is a single proxy for the entire bank such as trading volumes a business line approach using Committeeimposed capital ratio or thirdly internal measurement using a banks own loss data within a supervisory specified framework The implication is that further and more detailed work on the internal measurement approach may result an the development of appropriate models and a fourth regulatory option based on internal modelling There has been intense criticism from banks about an operational risk capital charge through industry groups such as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA and the British Bankers Association BBA However the Committees consistent position on a capital charge for other risks is encouraging initiatives to develop methodologies and coiled data related to managing operational risk Standardisation is some way off although there is growing industry agreement on a core operational risk definition the collection and sharing of internal loss data and the importance of qualitative criteria The proposal took banks by surprise the absence of a standard methodology led to fears of an arbitrary operational risk charge supplementary to existing capital charges for credit and market risk based on size and volume Allen Wheat chief executive officer and chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston speaking at Risks annual European congress in Paris last April described the proposal for an operational risk capital charge as the dopiest thing Ive ever seen Other leading banks like JP Morgan also expressed concern that an operational risk capital charge was premature when the industry had not come to an agreement on how important the issue was or how to measure it A ruleofthumb measurement would not accurately reflect different levels of risk in various banks and could result in overcharging some banks for risk and undercharging others Similarly operational risk capital charges could penalise banks competing against nonbanking organisations not subject to the charge The principal message to regulators is that larger banks with good operational risk measurement and management should achieve lower capital charges However without a standardised methodology proposed operational risk capital charge criteria need to be progressive flexible and include a riskbased option Joseph Sabitini managing director in the corporate risk management group at JP Morgan in New York recognises that a new regulatory framework for operational risk must accommodate banks at all levels of sophistication in terms of risk measurement and management but that it also includes a riskbased option for those with the appropriate capability Sabitini who has been working closely with the Risk Management Group of the Committee goes on to say that to avoid the shortcomings of the previous Accord the capital rules must also be transparent uniform and consistency applied A recent report by Meridien Research the Massachusettsbased technology and advisory service concludes that in two to three years only onethird of financial institutions will have the technology to measure and manage their operational risks The report examines how financial institutions measure up in a fourstage progression of addressing and implementing an operational risk management strategy In the first stage firms concentrate on the identification of key risk Indicators and data collection Stage two involves developing metrics and tracking for the identified risks from stage one Stages three and four move on to using technology for the measurement and management of those risks within a firm The report gods on to say that most firms are working in stages one and two of the operational risk management process With the regulatory option to focus on specific business lines such as investment banking retail banking or asset management banks are concentrating on internal definitions and management strategies But how are they preparing for a capital charge For most banks this includes lossgathering initiatives key indicator information risk assessment and in some cases calculation However unlike market risk and credit risk a purely quantitative approach to measure operational risk is not the current focus Chris Rachlin head of group operational risk at Royal Bank of Scotland RBS details the main initiatives his group have been focusing on We have been identifying and implementing tools and techniques to help our businesses identify manage and monitor operational risks better As part of this we have been collecting data on loss events We have also looked at a number of quantification techniques but believe their effectiveness will depend on the quality and quantity of the data available The current challenge is to find a way around the lack of data on big loss experiences Due to the rarity of these large losses banks lack extensive data on operational catastrophes such as Nick Leesonstyle fraud or a complete systems breakdown According to Tony Peccia vicepresident in the operational risk management division at CIBC World Markets in Toronto most banks would want to be at the internal measurement stage of the proposed capital charge when implemented which is dependent on internal data This has led to the establishment of a number of operational loss databases in particular introduction consortia of internal loss databases The two principal consortia are the Multinational Operational Risk Exchange managed by NetRisk and the Global Operational Loss Database Gold managed by the BBA which both provide a mechanism to share loss data in a secure environment The consortium members supply operational loss data business and risk characteristics to the managing agents The data is sanitised secured and scaled then returned to the consortium members As well as assisting banks to manage their operational risks the data can be used to compare their performance against their competitors and highlight vulnerable areas The More consortium has agreed to begin sharing data from November and receive the first batch of scrubbed anonymous data by the end of the year There are a number of concerns regarding data standards According to Richard Metcalfe ISDA Assistant Director of European Policy There is concern that while the proposed Basle Committee rules incentivise data gathering that is not the only issued if banks record their losses in general categories when submitting internal data but do not associate losses with enough contextual information it we be difficult to understand the finer gradations of risk later on or indeed to reclassify the database to an agreed industry or regulatory standard Matt Kimber a director with Arthur Andersens financial practice welcomes initiatives to collect internal loss data to increase the breadth of information available However he goes on to say that users of the information will have to be mindful of the parameters as to how the information is gathered and prepared Similar criticisms are also levelled at publicly disclosed external loss databases where issues of caring and cleansing must be considered Last month ISDA issued a discussion paper Operational Risk Regulatory Approach Discussion on operational risk capital charges The paper highlights concerns that a purely quantitative approach could enable institutions with poor operational risk management processes and controls but with access to internal loss event data to achieve a lower capital charge that institutions with stronger risk management processes but no access to internal loss event data The paper also highlights fears over the method of calculation of operational risk capital for an institution that has recently experienced serious loss but where management has reacted and strengthened the control environment in that area and consequently reduced the likelihood of reoccurrence The paper produced with the active support of over ISDA member firms and facilitated by PriceWaterhouseCoopers sets out a series of structured and transparent qualitative assessment criteria with particular reference to quantitative criteria to complement the operational risk data requirements currency proposed by regulators The paper argues blat there is strong support in the industry for a regulatory capital assessment model that allows institutions managing operational risk to effectively access a more precise means of Calculating an operational risk capital charge institutions should benefit from more sophisticated controls and the regulatory regime should establish incentives to improve risk management and controls This is consistent with proposed quantative techniques once internal loss data is incorporated into the operational risk capital charge calculation as any institution with an effective control environment would normally expect to have a lower loss experience and thus a lower capital charge According to Arthur Andersens Kimber there is another option insurance Insurance and risk transfer will become an important and sophisticated component in an operational risk managers toolbox over the next few years There are definitely challenges for insurance providers in offering operational risk cover but there has been some recent headway in the last year or two In fact regulators have made it clear that in principle mechanisms such as insurance might be an acceptable way for banks to mitigate risk and reduce their capital charges Depending on the stance of regulators the Committee might insist that policies that mitigate the capital charge pay out immediately after any operational disaster or that these polices only cover certain classes of operational risk It may also stipulate a specified credit rating of the insurance company or the percentage of risk that the primary insurer can sell into the wider insurance market Possibly the most wellknown operational risk insurance product is Swiss Res Financial Institutions Operational Risk Insurance Fiord With Fidelity Investments as the first client for the reinsurance firms product it is designed for the top financial institutions in the world FIORI would have covered most of the devastating losses that have hit the headlines over the last few years of them according to the insurers own analysis Lars SchmidtOtt head of global banking practice at Swiss Re New Markets sees insurance as a good alternative to capital charges Holding Capital on the balance sheet is not good for shareholder value if you can keep it off the balance sheet at an efficient price you only pay the downside premium But according to RBSs Rachlin there are a number of problems with the insurance option principally the speed of payment and potential lack of capacity for meaningful levels of rover from financially secure insurers Although some products on the market will provide immediate liquidity to a bank following a disaster there may be certain arguments after the event Policies with catastrophe levels of cover would also need to be scheduled or layered and it is not always possible to secure acceptance for finely worded polices from differed underwriters Rachlin also highlights reputational issues While insurance may cover the shortterm financial impact for some events the longer term reputation impact can be of greater concern Although SchmidtOtt does not agree that there are any reputational issues using insurance products he recognises that it may be some time before gaining relief from operational risk charges becomes a real incentive to take out insurance Insurance will play a role as an instrument for managing operational risk but not in its current formwe are waiting for the regulators Insurance aside the Basle Committees capital charge announcement for operational risk is not eagerly awaited If the regulators make their announcements in the first quarter of they probably would not become effective until at least Depending on the flexibility of the proposals research into internal modelling approaches to operational risk is likely to intensify Victor Dowd an associate involved with operational risk capital charge discussion at the UKs Financial Services Authority agrees that further and more detailed work on the internal measurement approach may result in the development of appropriate models However for the present he says modelling is not an option for the regulators to consider Enron To Expand Weather Derivatives

Derivatives Growth Lures US Banks To Europe German Electricity Market Set For Growth EuroMPs Seek Reform Delay Exchange Mergers To Encourage Derivatives Markets Asia Risk November Malaysias derivatives markets are set for big changes after December This is now the mostly likely date for the merger between the Commodity and Monetary Exchange of Malaysia Commex The amalgamation will bring together all the countrys exchangelisted futures and options trading Completion of the merger also seems likely to lead to the launch of several new derivatives contracts which had been put on hold pending the union Kloffe which is owned by the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange currently lists just one contract futures on the KLSE composite share index Commex is itself the result of a merger in late between the year old Commodity Exchange offering palm oil contracts and the Malaysian Monetary Exchange which began operating in to provide three month klibor futures The need to rationalise Malaysias exchanges and cut costs are the main reasons for the merger according to Allan Au Yond head of business development at Commex This rationalisation is being strongly pushed by the government as part of its broader plans for consolidation in the financial sector Although volumes have fallen on both the Kloffe and Commex since controls were imposed in September Au Yond says this is not the key factor in amalgamation In any case activity on the Commex is rebounding he says A new name for the combined exchange has not been decided After the proposed December merger the trading of all futures and options will be located in the stock exchange building All trading will also be electronic At present Kloffe trades on screen but Commex still uses the openoutcry system According to Commex officials they will be seeking approval for a bond futures contract to compliment the shortterm klibor one Kolfe meanwhile is planning to launch options on the composite share index before the end of the year Exchange officials would also like to launch options on individual shares However this will have to wait until the authorities lift the ban on short selling and the lending of shares Such practices were banned in August during the Asian Crisis although short positions on composite index futures are allowed At that time excessive shortselling was blamed for the sharp drop in share prices While the ban exists options on individual shares would be unlikely to find much investor interest Another launch proposal under consideration is a futures contract on an Islamic index covering shares acceptable under Shari law Kloffe was hit quite badly by the imposition of foreign exchange controls in September Until trading volumes had been rising The early days of East Asias crisis inevitably created heaving trading with monthly contract volumes peaking at in June The average monthly volume in the first half of this year has not been much more than a third of that level This is hardly surprising Foreigners accounted for about of the Kloffe turnover in This year the proportion is down to as foreign equity investors deserted the country once the repatriation controls were relaxed New equity portfolio investment from overseas remains low Along with other Asian markets the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange has seen a sharp fall in share prices in In the year to early October the Malaysia dollar returns index compiled by Standard Poors IFC was showing a fall of almost But this was only half the drop seen across much of the region which posted an average slide of Share price performances this year partially reverse the strong advances made in when the Malaysian market climbed and gains in Asia averaged Equity Derivatives Growth Lures US Banks To Europe IFR November By Elisabeth Bertalanffy US investment banks including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch are stepping up their bid to win equity derivatives business in Continental Europe after a boom year One area in which they are aiming to win market share from European banks is the sale of derivatives Alastair Cooper managing director in the equity group at MSDW in London said that the bank has increased the headcount in its European equity derivatives operations by this year and is planning to add roughly the same number next year The vast majority of these hires have been and will be on the marketing side The client functionality side such as research has also been boosted The bank is also preparing to roll out an improved technology platform early next year which will provide sophisticated online facilities for its clients According to Cooper the bank has invested a lot in the platform which offers for example stateoftheart risk management and execution management systems and also in improving its infrastructure Over the last few years MSDW has been rapidly building up headcount and resources across virtually all product lines in Europe Equity derivatives however had been lagging behind in this expansion drive Cooper explained owing in part to prioritization and risk appetite considerations Last year the banks management made the decision significantly to expand MSDWs European equity derivatives business with a special commitment to carving out a market position in the mushrooming local retail markets The decision was driven by several factors according to Cooper First MSDW wanted to leverage its strength in related areas such as its equity cash highnetworth individuals and mergers and acquisitions businesses he said Also the bank is extremely optimistic on economic prospects in Europe which it believes point to further growth in equity derivatives volumes in the near future Additionally Cooper noted that the range and sophistication of equity products has been steadily increasing especially in the retail sector with strong growth in singlename and sectoral products One of the most important elements in MSDWs foray into the European equity derivatives and retail arena where so far the bank has not left much of a mark is its efforts on the technology side This is especially important for retail clients whom the bank can now reach directly MSDWs interest in the retail market has been sparked by the considerable increase in the volume of equity and equitylinked products in this area Cooper pointed to the advanced warrant and certificate markets across Europe as well as to the breadth of alternative assets like funds of hedge funds The retail market is becoming more and more sophisticated and the product offering wider and more complex he said Internet trading is furthering this trend because it makes it so easy to deal Merrill Lynch has been targeting the European retail market for some time now and is one of the largest US players on the Continent The bank is managing to leverage off its strong position in the US equity markets to compete with European banks and has also been willing to commit large numbers of staff and significant investment in technology to make a name for itself Merrill strongly emphasises the ecommerce side of the business currently offering a dozen product sites in eight languages around the world in Europe it provides sites for Italian German and UK clients and a fully integrated global product menu From this month its online site allows for the trading of warrants and certificates On the retail side in Europe the bank already offers a range of equitylinked products including certificates and LDRs tracker shares jointly developed with European stock exchanges and STOXX On its certificate platform the bank more than doubled issuance in Europe this year It has also rolled its successful US HOLDRS product out in Europe It is among the market leaders in warrants and listed options Aside from the welldeveloped Swiss and German markets Spain and Italy are also promising retail arenas for the future MSDWs acquisition of Spanish firm AB Asesores last year will provide a valuable launching pad for the banks foray into this market as it provides it with an extensive retail brokerage presence Cooper said At the same time it is expanding its credit card business in Europe and stepping up direct braking and marketing he added Cooper acknowledged that it would be difficult to compete against established retail market players like Deutsche Bank and UBS Warburg on their home turf MSDW will thus focus on niche sectors and will also take advantage of its strengths like its leading role in the technology sector The bank will also be able to add value in nonEuropean indices and sectors Banks that want to be successful in the European retail markets have to recognise that it is a staffintensive low margin highvolume business Merrill for example has equity derivatives salespeople worldwide and a staggering retail financial consultants Another crucial element is a strong technology platform which is costly and takes time to set up It remains to be seen if other US houses which have traditionally been strong in equity derivatives are willing to take the plunge into the retail market Goldman Sachs for example has so far focused primarily on the highmargin business of large institutional clients using fewer staff to cover large areas of the market However the European equity derivatives retail market has been going strong for some time now and shows no signs of slowing down It would come as no surprise if more US players were to push into the sector soon German Electricity Market Set For Growth IFR November The German electricity derivatives market is expected to grow tenfold over the next four years a development that will be helped by the startup of several electricity spot and futures exchanges Last month the European Energy Exchange EEX started simulating energy futures trades with market participants including banks and regional and international electricity providers according to an EEX spokesman in Frankfurt The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is also targeting the German as well as the Dutch electricity futures market in cooperation with the Hanover commodity exchange And the Leipzig Power Exchange LPX is planning to roll out futures trading in the first half of next year An official at a leading German energy company said that volume in the electricity forwards market in Germany is currently only about Em per year By however the company forecasts volumes of up to Em times as much The vast majority of these trades are done overthecounter His company currently trades forwards futures swaps and options as well as hybrid products linked to the prices of commodities whose production is very energy consuming such as aluminum Tenors are usually a year Liquidity is still lagging behind even in the spot markets EEX which launched electricity spot trading in August has average weekly trading volumes of roughly megawatt hours Rival LPX trades roughly half that amount In the derivatives arena the major players are investment banks like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and international power companies like Enron or Hess as well as local electricity company RWE But all the signs are there that the electricity derivatives market is poised to take off The official pointed to the fact that the market for qualified energy derivatives personnel such as traders as well as legal and compliance experts is completely exhausted It shows how everybody is looking to build up or strengthen their capabilities in this business he said adding that his company also is looking for International Swaps and Derivatives Association documentation experts A twopronged approach is necessary to foster the energy derivatives market the official stressed First it is important to conduct education and information campaigns to draw smaller players into the market and lobby for the standardisation of contracts to increase trading volumes and liquidity Another important application for energy derivatives is as an access provider to lesser deregulated markets in Europe according to the official He explained that Germany and the UK are the most deregulated energy markets in Europe while other markets like the Benelux countries and Italy still lag behind The easiest way to enter and open up these countries is via derivatives which are unregulated EuroMPs Seek Reform Delay Financial Times November By Doug Cameron The European parliament is seeking a moratorium on sweeping reform of the global banking industry because of concern that US banks will gain a competitive advantage The Bank of International Settlements BIS the industrys de facto regulator is due to publish a consultation paper in January on updating the Basle Accord which governs how banks manage risks on their balance sheets The BIS plans to allow banks to use their internal systems for managing and monitoring risks replacing the current framework where central banks set minimum capital requirements to cover potential losses However while US banks may be able to implement the changes by the start of European rivals will have to wait as long as three years as legislation passes through the European Commission Council of Ministers and parliament Sarah Villers the European parliament member for London who leads its working group on the Basle reforms said that while the US introduced the rules in a matter of months the EU took twoandahalf years European banks undoubtedly suffered last time said Ms Villers A report passed last week by the parliament said the EU should also press for a moratorium on the implementation of the revised accord for an agreed period of time to allow Basle Committee members to adopt implementing legislation and enable the accord to enter into force on the same day in all countries However the industry appears to be resigned to implementation at different times and many view it as the price worth paying for the greater management flexibility that the internal ratings system will provide We have to live with the fact that the EU cannot go any faster said Jan Kalff the former chairman of ABN Amro who now heads work on Basle for the Institute of International Finance a trade body for the global banking industry There will be a competitive disadvantage for the EUbased banks unless we can force the US to slow down he said adding that this was unlikely The large US banks which are expected to benefit most from the revised accord are keen to push for its early implementation Officials involved in the Basle talks suggested that the BIS was unwilling as well as powerless to become involved in any possible confrontation with the US over the timetable However officials conceded that a twintrack timetable would contradict its intention of creating a level playing field in the way banks manage risk and are monitored by local regulatory authorities Ms Villiers agreed that the US was unlikely to accede to any request for delay and was pressing for fasttrack European legislation which would at best allow directives implementing the new accord to be passed in a minimum of around months End of ISDA Press Report for Wednesday November THE ISDA

Looms The Wall Street Journal Europe OTC Derivatives Market Grows Financial Times DC Bar Panelists Call for Tax Law Review In Wake of FASB Rule Change on Derivatives BNA Inc Ops Execs See Raised Profile Operations Management UK Association Sets Up Think Tank Operations Management Firms Alter Derivatives Use As Rule Change Looms The Wall Street Journal Europe November By Joe Niedzielski Some big US corporations are altering their use of derivatives in the runup to a new accounting rule that goes on the books next year according to a survey of senior financial executives released by Solutioncom LLC The basic findings of the survey of more than senior executives at Fortune companies confirm what some observers of the derivatives markets have been saying for several months Corporations will stick with simple or plain vanilla derivatives instruments because of the complexity and requirements of the new rule known as Financial Accounting Standard In its broadest form FAS requires corporations to report on their balance sheets the fair market value of their holdings of derivatives and that they be marked to market Corporations have publicly voiced their concerns in recent years that the standard may result in significant earnings volatility and hurt their share prices That concern remains among the top issues for those corporate executives surveyed by Solutioncom an Internetbased resource of information and tools that lets companies tackle the valuation accounting and reporting requirements of the new rule Solutioncom is a joint venture of PricewaterhouseCoopers and Gifford Fong Associates Hopefully all companies that produce USbased GAAP Generally Accepted Accounting Principles financial statements are evaluating their use of derivatives and hedges especially understanding the impact on earnings volatility that could occur as a result of FAS said Stan Friedman Solutioncoms chairman and chief executive officer The new standard has also been viewed by many observers as a spotlight into the riskmanagement profiles of US corporations Thats because the standard also requires corporations to describe their riskmanagement strategies and reasons for undertaking a particular hedge at its inception The correlation or effectiveness of the derivative with the hedged item must also be tested Solutioncom said the results of the survey reflect an increasing concern that these requirements expose a company to an unprecedented degree of outside scrutiny Not surprisingly those corporations surveyed ranked testing for hedge effectiveness documenting riskmanagement strategies and valuing derivatives as their three chief concerns with the new accounting standard though earnings volatility closely followed Some of the large companies that were dealing with are much more concerned about doing the hedge effectiveness test than anything else Mr Friedman said The survey also suggested that corporations will become more risk adverse and alter their selection of derivatives No longer able to defer gains or losses companies are being forced to review their derivative strategies and internal assessment of risk in more detail the Solutioncom report said Accounting requirements are top of mind as executives evaluate their positions and many companies are anticipating changes or adjustments in their earnings That has led to an increased focus on avoiding any speculative activity The more exotic the instrument the more likely the internal scrutiny on its merits the report said Of the of the corporations surveyed that used derivative many said they would avoid more customized or targeted derivatives and stay with the plain vanilla type until they fully understood the possibility of any earnings ramifications OTC Derivatives Market Grows Financial Times November The global overthecounter derivatives market grew by almost per cent in value during the first half of this year according to Swaps Monitor Publications a US research group SMP said the notional size of the global derivatives market grew to Dollars bn at the end of June an increase of per cent from Dollars bn in outstanding derivatives transactions at the end of Interestrate swaps increased by per cent in the first half of the year to a total notional value of Dollars bn from Dollars bn at the end of The swaps which involve the swapping of a fixedinterest rate payment for a floating rate one on debts of same maturity and value are increasingly being used by investors as a means of hedging fixedincome investments Interestrate options remained unchanged at Dollars bn while interestrate forwards grew to Dollars bn from Dollars bn The figures are compiled from databases of about global OTC derivatives dealers DC Bar Panelists Call for Tax Law Review In Wake of FASB Rule Change on Derivatives BNA Inc November The Democratic chief tax counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee said Nov he thought Congress should review the taxation of derivatives in view of changes to the accounting rules for reporting of gains and losses from derivatives John Buckley spoke at a program on derivatives presented by the DC Bar Section on Taxation Committee on Financial Instruments and Products Other speakers included Mark Price and Steve Rosenthal of KPMG and Chuck Wheeler of Alston Bird Price said Financial Accounting Standard No adopted in by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and amended in June DTR G requires separate accounting for derivatives using a marktomarket approach like that used under Internal Revenue Code Section The new rule requires that any change in the value of the derivative be bookedincluded as a gain or loss in determining the companys income for financial accounting purposeseven if the company has not disposed of the derivative The result Price said is to create increased volatility in the companys determination of income and loss for accounting purposes Wheeler said that companies do not want this increased volatility to apply to their determinations of income for tax purposes Price said the accounting profession adopted new standards for derivatives because of numerous problems including incomplete reporting in that some companies reported no information or reported information only in a footnote inconsistent reporting in that companies used different rules for determining cost and value difficulty in applying the accounting rules and lack of transparency in that companies took different approaches in their treatment of derivatives meaning income was not determined under the same rules and information on financial statements could not be compared with reliability Issues for Congress to Study Buckley said the marktomarket approach is slowly being adopted in the tax system He said it was not something he favored across the board but in his view it made sense for the tax system to apply the marktomarket approach to derivatives He said the problems identified by Price in accounting for derivatives also applied to the tax systemthere is uncertainty and inconsistency Buckley also said it would simplify recordkeeping to conform the tax system to the accounting approach and he favored Congress looking at this question He said that Congresss adoption of the marktomarket approach for securities in the early s was the right approach and he thought that the Financial Accounting Standards Board had taken an interesting and important step in adopting FAS Buckley said he sees the problem of defining a derivative as a major issue for the tax law and questioned whether the accounting definition was workable Other panelists said it is but Price noted that the definition is very factspecific and Wheeler said the rules are so new it is too early to tell whether companies will attempt to structure transactions to use the accounting definition Buckley said an additional issue would be whether gains and losses from derivatives should be treated as capital or ordinary under a marktomarket approach Hedge Accounting Reduces Volatility Wheeler said that some companies show reserves on their financial statements to account for potential losses in value but that this is not generally used for tax reporting Rosenthal said a current Tax Court case involves the Internal Revenue Service disputing a companys use of a credit adjustment to reduce income Price said the rules allow companies to elect to use hedge accounting He said a company which recognized gain or loss from a derivative identified as a hedge could have an offsetting gain or loss from the item being hedged Thus hedge accounting reduces the volatility created by FAS for companies that hedge their risk However FAS contains a strict definition for a hedge and an item could lose its character as a hedge because the definition is reapplied every quarter to the same item The panelists noted that for tax purposes once an item is considered a hedge its character would not change subsequently Price said the new FASB rule applies to entities that report to the Securities Exchange Commission and are effective for fiscal years beginning after June and Jan for companies reporting on a calendar year Ops Execs See Raised Profile Operations Management November Operations and technology executives are taking on a larger role within firms and ate receiving more senior job titles as a result according to a Russell Reynolds Associates study to be released this week The head of operations is no longer just a senior vp but is now at the partner level said George Wilbanks partner with Russell Reynolds The shift has been prompted by a number of factors including the blurring of lines between banks insurers mutual fund firms and other financial services companies and the growing importance of multiple channels and the subsequent complexity of operations and information Firms need much more robust technology and operations platforms to handle the added complexity Wilbanks said The study Recruiting Trends in Investment Management also found an increase in the number of searches in operations because many firms do not have someone in place who can take on a more executive role UK Association Sets Up Think Tank Operations Management November The Computing Services and Software Association the UK trade association for the IT services and software sector is establishing a think tank to investigate applied technology in the financial and business sectors The idea originated with members who were noticing the proliferation of technology initiatives and wanted ways to navigate them said Andrew Muir director of global securities solutions for Mercator and chair of the banking and finance group for CSSA With so many software initiatives it is difficult for the industry to know how to direct research and development to apply the evolving technology explained Muir For example SWIFTs SWIFTNet the new Internet Protocol based network will impact on initiatives such as Continuous Linked Settlement and the Global Straight Through Processing Association Muir said The bimonthly meetings will begin Dec in London and then white papers will be issued to promote thought and provide direction to the industry Muir noted Muir will head up the soontobenamed think tank and will be joined by Anthony Kirby the axexecutive director of the GSTPA who is now heading up a team responsible for BB at Boleronet and John Wilson a director with Londonbased consultancy CityIQ There will also be senior representatives from the leading securities firms including Deutsche Bank and UBS Warburg and other vendors an industry official noted Calls to Wilson and Kirby were not returned End of

Times Singapore Derivatives Platform May Give CBA Edge Over Locals Australian Financial Review Kloffe Launches KLSE CI Options Contract Business Times Malaysia CFTC Rules Could Change Futures Industry How Is The Question Bridge News Web BondTrade Systems Draw Regulators Scrutiny The Wall Street Journal New MAS Guidelines On Credit Derivatives Business Times Singapore December By Ling Su Ann The Monetary Authority of Singapore yesterday issued new guidelines on the capital treatment of credit derivatives to deal with the problem of excessive capital charge for a debt asset Credit derivatives first used in the United States in are used by banks to reduce their risk exposure to certain credits or loans In a typical creditlinked note transaction the protection seller Bank A assumes the credit risk from the protection buyer Bank B in return for a stream of regular interest payments Bank B will then assume the default risk for a preselected asset and Bank A will acquire the credit exposure to both the reference asset in this case the notes and Bank B Under Section of MAS notice the seller is required to sum up the riskweighted exposures to both the notes and Bank B A capital charge of per cent is then applied to the aggregate credit exposure resulting in a uniform per cent capital charge for protection selling banks This would clearly be excessive says the MAS especially when the reference assets are of very high credit quality In June last year the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision proposed a more risksensitive standardised approach Pending the finalisation of this new framework protection selling banks should not be unduly penalised MAS said To address this concern protection sellers will now be allowed to apply the higher of the risk charges appropriate to the reference asset or protection buyer subject to the condition that both are rated as being investment grade or higher BBBand above Should the credit rating of either fall below investment grade a dual capital charge must be applied to both these credit exposures Where the reference asset or protection buyer is not rated the MAS may waive the dual charge rule on a casebycase basis However it must be shown that the risk faced by the seller is adequately addressed by a single capital charge The rule wont impact Singapore banks right now because they dont enter into a high amount of credit derivatives But it will make things more transparent by telling banks how to treat the notes on their balance sheets said Joe Toh credit analyst at UOB Asia Derivatives Platform May Give CBA Edge Over Locals Australian Financial Review December By George Lekakis Commonwealth Bank of Australia is hoping that a new inhouse derivatives risk management platform will lead to a reduction of regulatory capital it is required to hold on its balance sheet The new risk simulation system known as CSPARQ was launched in July and is being used to scope credit and market risk in CBAs institutional banking arm Mr Ellis Bugg a senior risk executive said the system would be extended to the foreign exchange operations in the next six months He said the platform would give CBA a competitive edge over other local investment banks in evaluating current and future trading exposures Mr Bugg said the Reserve Bank was aware of the advantages of the inhouse system but was not yet prepared to allow any variation in the banks Tier One capital requirements Up until now most risk analysis systems have simply analysed present positions and risk exposures he said This system is forward looking allowing us to project exposures in the future over the entire life of a fiveyear contract for instance The bank is also considering setting up a special unit that would take on risk management business from corporate clients and less efficient financial institutions The head of technology in the institutional bank Mr Bob Stribling said CBA was among a handful of banks that had the capability of running near realtime credit simulation on a global basis We think we have something quite special that could be used outside the group A string of derivatives driven disasters in global banks since the mids has prompted crossborder regulators led by the Bank of International Settlements to clamp down on the measurement and reporting of derivative risk in banking CBA embarked on a complete overhaul of its risk management system in its investment bank in November and launched the new platform in July At the height of the Asian economic crisis in shortcomings in the risk management systems of institutions such as ANZ and Caspian Securities were highlighted with the companies reporting big losses from derivatives related activities in emerging markets Since then local regulators have paid more attention to the risk management tools and disclosure of the big four Australian banks National CBA Westpac and ANZ on their derivatives based exposures Mr Bugg said no other bank in Australia had developed such risk management capabilities CBA was aware of only three North American banks that were using similar methodologies Kloffe Launches KLSE CI Options Contract Business Times Malaysia December By Debra Moreira The Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange Bhd Kloffe today launches its second product the KLSE CI Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index options contract The move is part of the plan to increase the number of products and enhance liquidity in the market Kloffe is hoping the product will attract local and foreign institutional support which will subsequently assist towards building and attracting liquidity Kloffe a whollyowned subsidiary of the KLSE is the first derivatives exchange in Malaysia Executive chairman Ramli Ibrahim has said that the new product is a step in he right direction to woo foreign investors back in the country citing as one of the reasons investors were staying out was due to a lack of choice in products Kloffe will also be introducing an additional two products by the first quarter of placing high importance on futures products based on Islamic index It the options contract is a good step forward in developing an interest and hopefully bring back the foreign investors It is a step in the right direction Ramli said Although a huge initial demand for the product is not expected Kloffe expects the product to grow gradually as people get used to it Kloffe recognises that it is critical for all market participants to be properly educated to ensure that they have sufficient understanding of the use of derivatives products and are fully equipped to manage their investment portfolios said Ramli As such Kloffe is currently undertaking a comprehensive marketing and educational programme for the KLSE CI Options launch and to promote the existing product An option provides the holderbuyer the right without the obligation to purchase call or sell put a quantity of a specific underlying instrument at a stipulated price within a specific period of time To acquire this right the holderbuyer pays a minimal price known as the option premium to the seller also called the writer of the option A futures contract however is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell the underlying instrument at a specific time in the future for a specific price determined today CFTC Rules Could Change Futures Industry How Is The Question Bridge News November By Mary Haffenberg After months of anticipation new regulatory rules were released last week that pave the way for changes in how exchanges list derivatives contracts The proposals also open the door for new electronic trading platforms and clearing organizations to jump into the derivatives listing and clearing business But how these rules will be interpreted without making them into law is leaving some industry players wary The Commodity Futures Trading Commission the regulator of US derivatives markets last week approved rules first proposed in February that create a new regulatory framework for futures markets The rules which go into effect days after they first appear in the Federal Register create three regulatory tiers under which various futures contracts and swaps products in established markets will fall The idea is that the three tiers will match the degree of regulation to the varying nature of the products and the customers trading in the markets Under the new rules the three regulatory tiers are recognized futures exchanges derivatives transactions facilities and exempt multilateral transaction execution facilities Products within the RFE category for example will allow for retail participation and those contracts will have the most customer protection and regulatory safeguards attached to them A bill that passed the House of Representatives in October but is stalled in the Senate would make into law most of these CFTC rule changes The bill also would legalize single stock futures provide legal certainty to overthecounter markets take the CFTC rule changes even farther in some areas and make other changes not within the power of the CFTC If the bill the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of does overcome significant obstacles in the Senate and pass when Congress returns next month to finish up its work the bill would supercede any CFTC rules Because the CFTC rules dont go into effect until at least the end of January or the beginning of February as of Wednesday they still had not been listed on the Federal Register lawyers and others reading the rules have been in no hurry to digest and interpret them In addition a lot could change if lawmakers pass the futures modernization act WIDESPREAD PRAISE FOR RULE CHANGES To be sure the rule changes that have been spurred on by CFTC Chairman William Rainer have received widespread praise Market participants and established exchanges like the idea that in the less regulated markets costs to do business are expected to decrease Also less regulation could lead to more flexibility in listing and trading contracts and more experimentation in the futures markets which in recent years have been sorely lagging when compared with the growth of cash and securities markets There also is a doubleedged sword of changes The rules make it significantly easier for a new electronic trading platform similar to electronic communications networks popular in the equities markets to come in and list futures contracts taking on the established futures exchanges that for decades have had a virtual contractlisting monopoly The rules also allow for the first time nonCFTC regulated organizations to clear exempt MTEF and bilateral contracts However these clearing groups still must be regulated under banking laws foreign regulators or the Securities and Exchange Commission Established clearing organizations and futures exchanges already are expressing concern that these new expected competitors will be able to become more nimble because they should be able to operate under less regulation The established exchanges and clearing organizations are expected to fall under the most regulated CFTC tier of regulations if they are to continue to serve retail customers If were a provider of a broad series of markets its unclear as to the net savings said Dennis Dutterer interim president and CEO of the Chicago Board of Trade By some estimates more than of futures market participants are institutional or commercial customers With that figure in mind ECNs could come in and list contracts under the DTF category That would prohibit retail customer participation unless the ECN got special CFTC approval that would allow retail trading through futures commission merchants that have at least million in adjusted net capital The exchanges which to date have had at least some retail participation in most of their contracts would have to continue under RFE rules Some industry watchers suggested that some exchanges to combat ECN competition yet retain retail customers could list two contracts For example the New York Board of Trade could have an RFE sugar pit and an allelectronic DTF sugar pit NYBOT President and CEO Mark Fichtel said his exchange was expected to request that its sugar and cocoa contracts fall under the DTF category Im not saying this will happen but based on what theyre talking about they have to be careful about compartmentalizing the markets said Joseph Murphy CEO of Refco Global Futures one of the countrys largest FCMs A probable solution would be to put it on the backs of FCMs We could become market makers to give access to our retail customers like the FX markets referring to the cash foreign exchange markets in which the interbank markets commonly take the other side of a customer trade instead of routing it to outside customers Others question whether that is the course of the futures markets as a result of the rule changes and whether it is good for the markets to have peripheral markets proliferating However its still too early to determine how the traditional exchanges will list their contracts under these new rules Although no one is suggesting that the exchanges will close their doors to easy access for retail customers allowing them in their markets may not be cheap I would hope that the CFTC would continue the concept of trying to ensure that our markets are competitive with competing markets when the exchanges are looking for flexibility to respond to competitive possibilities Dutterer said SWAP MARKETS CONTINUE WITH EXEMPTIONS For their part participants in swaps are basically happy with what the CFTC has done within their limited powers with the exempt MTEF rules For example new entities such as insurance companies can participate in the swaps markets These markets will continue to operate under an exemption of the commodities act and will continue on without legal certainty but a spokeswoman for the International Swaps and Derivatives Association said the rule changes were an improvement over current conditions However the ISDA is unhappy that only financial products can be included in the exempt MTEF category The CFTC said metals and energy contracts cannot qualify for exempt MTEF the least regulated tier because the markets are not sufficiently deep and liquid and there are concerns related to the exhaustibility of supply and market manipulation As a result multilateral electronic executing trading facilities will fall under the DTF category which has led to concerns that the regulations may stymie innovation in these markets Once the rules do come into play and assuming Congress does not codify them there is still another underlying concern Because the CFTC rules are not law some in the industry worry how they will be interpreted in the upcoming years and under different CFTC heads After all the regulator has had its share of leaders with vastly different philosophies from each other Web BondTrade Systems Draw Regulators Scrutiny The Wall Street Journal December By Randall Smith and Gregory Zuckerman Antitrust regulators launched an investigation of online bondtrading and foreignexchange systems owned by several of Wall Streets biggest securities firms to examine whether the trading platforms are used to limit competition Several top securities firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc Merrill Lynch Co Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup Inc have received requests for information as part of the investigation which is being conducted by the antitrust division of the US Department of Justice The firms either had no comment or said they are cooperating A Justice Department spokesman said the agency is looking at the competitive effects of certain joint ventures in the online bondtrading industry and in online foreign exchange The inquiry was reported Thursday by the Bond Buyer newspaper and the Web site of Industry Standard a magazine that covers Internet economic issues Ralph C Ferrara a lawyer specializing in securities regulation at the New York law firm of Debevoise Plimpton said the probe raises an interesting issue because a commonly owned utility that boosts price transparency for the entire market but simultaneously gives firms a look at each others market strategies is something that is a Jekyll and a Hyde The requests for information known as civil investigative demands involve the recent formation of several online bond and foreignexchange portals by Wall Streets biggest firms in various combinations people familiar with the matter say I think their interest is because the largest firms are involved together said John Ladensack bond chief for the Schwab Capital Markets unit of San Francisco discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp Schwab which is forming its own bondtrading portal has avoided participation in some online marketplaces because of the dominance of the big players Mr Ladensack said The probe isnt the only Justice Department investigation into the inner workings of Wall Street Another pending inquiry disclosed in early is focusing on the prevalence of a underwriting fee for initial public offerings of less than million in size Federal regulators have looked at the antitrust implications of a wide range of other Internet marketplaces from cars to real estate to airline tickets The American Society of Travel Agents for example asked the Justice Department to investigate an online service owned by several airlines saying it would drive travel agents out of business The Federal Trade Commission has approved a carparts Web site set up by the Big Three auto makers Electronic bond trading is growing but has yet to catch on Such activity represents just to of overall bond trading according to Tower Group a technologyresearch firm up from about last year Its worth investigating the area There are questions about how these markets will turn electronic and whether these dealers will control the market place says Larry Tabb group director at Tower Group The concern is that they see each others bids and can artificially manipulate prices and that they will create an electronic market thats not open to all participants but so far it looks like theyre letting others in Two of the bestknown upstart onlinebond systems sponsored by leading Wall Street firms that deal with corporate bonds are BondBook LLC and Market Axess LLC Another of the big online trading firms is TradeWeb LLC owned by a group including Goldman Sachs Lehman Brothers Group Holdings Inc and the Credit Suisse First Boston unit of Credit Suisse Group TradeWebs trading volume represents between and of all dealertocustomer transactions in the US Treasury market up from a year ago according to Tower Group although TradeWeb officials say the figure is higher With TradeWebs online system investors can contact as many as five dealers at a time and send them orders to buy or sell Treasurys or governmentagency securities Investors also can compare prices from the five firms The dealers cant see bond quotes from their rivals according to Tom Eady chief operating officer at TradeWeb Mr Eady says the firm hasnt been contacted by the Department of Justice securities executives said the Justice probe doesnt appear to encompass Treasury bonds End of ISDA Press Report for Friday December

Committee hears Lamfalussy on financial services Reuters Bank regulator intervenes in Turkish crisis Financial Times Slightly Altered Bankruptcy Bill Clears Senate Committee American Banker FASB Excludes Joint Ventures From Business Combinations Project BNA March NORWALK ConnThe Financial Accounting Standards Board Feb wrestled with how to define joint ventures business enterprises intended to be outside the scope of rules on business combinations and the kind of reporting that will leave deeper imprints on firms earnings statements than current practice FASB specifically excluded joint ventures from its pending proposal on accounting for mergers and acquisitions The proposal is expected to yield final rules in late June The rationale for the decision to exclude joint ventures is the idea that there exist shared enterprises or mutually beneficial projects of companies or other entities that do not represent an acquisition of one enterprise by another Instead two or more existing corporations governments or perhaps even individual people may combine assets and create a genuinely new enterprise to for example develop a new product or technology Such joint ventures often carry with them veto rights of the venturers that typically are not enjoyed by shareholders of a public company Goal Is Speedy Issuance In addition FASB members have stressed their goal of issuing as quickly as possible a standard to remedy longstanding problems in the use of the poolingofinterests method of accounting in more breadandbutter corporate combinations In the past joint ventures have presented difficult definitional problems They are a focus of the phase two of the boards business combinations project which deals with new basis accounting issues At the same time FASB believes the topic of joint ventures warrants actionor at least some clarificationto address the misapplication of joint venture accounting to transactions that should be accounted for as business combinations according to a recommendation of the boards staff endorsed at the Feb meeting Under current accounting practice for joint ventures the assets in play are reported on a carryover basis at historical cost That treatment mirrors the effect of a pooling under which the book values of the assets of two combining companies are merely added together leaving no dent on the income statement With the impending issuance of the new rules on combinations FASB would bar poolings and instead require use of the purchase method of accounting Under purchase accounting one company is identified as the acquirer It must record the cost of purchasing a company on its books whether it uses cash or exchanges stock to acquire the target firm APB s Description Clarified In defining joint venture FASB Feb tentatively decided to retain the description of the term in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock It also would add the clarifications to help draw boundaries around use of joint venture accounting in areas where the planned rules on combinations should come into play The term corporate joint venture refers to a corporation owned and operated by a small group of businesses the joint venturers as a separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the members of the group APB the rulemaking board that preceded FASB stated in Opinion No A government may also be a member of the group APB said the purpose of a joint venture frequently is to share risks and rewards in developing a new market product or technology and to pool knowhow and resources to reach the joint goal In addition such a corporate joint venture usually provides an arrangement under which each venturer may help manage the venture and have an interest or relationship other than as a passive investor according to APB No In extended discussion that showed how difficult the issue of joint ventures is FASB agreed most strongly on adding by way of clarification that the participating rights entailed in taking part in a joint venture have some economic substance beyond shareholder rights Along those lines FASB and its staff plan to refer to guidance completed in by the boards Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No That guidance is used for investors accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of voting interest in a firm but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights Sticky Issues Two other issues to be taken up in the planned clarification proved to be sticky Feb First the board will try to resolve whether an individual person can be a joint venturer in other words whether an individuals participation in what is termed a joint venture can mean that the label is legitimate and not simply form part of a cover for what in reality is a business combination or acquisition That issue carries some relevance internationally as pointed out by Michael Crooch a FASB member In some countries laws require that a citizen of that country be a partnerif not a majority shareholder of recordin an enterprise financed by a foreign company The last issue confronting FASB pertains to planned transactions The board posed the following question If a company planned at the date of formation of the venture to issue a public offering of stock stemming from the venture was the enterprise a joint venture What if the offering of stock were unplannned In coming weeks FASBs staff plans to work on answering those questions and return to the board with recommendations We need to take this around the track one more time said FASB Chairman Edmund Jenkins The board plans to make the envisioned language on joint ventures part of the standard on business combinations rather than place it in the planned rules basis for conclusions Derivatives Guidance to Be on Web Separately Feb FASB approved clarifications to cure some confusion about use of guidance on the boards rules on derivatives and hedge accounting Statement No The guidance developed with the help of the boards Derivatives Implementation Group was cleared previously by the board DIG Issue No H Measuring the Amount of Ineffectiveness in a Net Investment Hedge FASB plans to post the revised guidance March on its World Wide Web site EP Committee hears Lamfalussy on financial services Reuters English News Service March Lamfalussy and financial services MEPs seek call back mechanism Appearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee Alexandre LAMFALUSSY chair of the Group of Wise Men on Financial Services responded to concerns raised by MEPs seeking a call back mechanism as part of a new approach to speed up the integration of Europes financial markets The committee wants to retain the right to review legislation as it passes through various processes should this be considered necessary Mr LAMFALUSSY has proposed setting up two new committees an EU Securities Committee and an EU Securities Regulatory Committee to help speed up necessary financial reforms He has offered to allay Parliaments concerns by keeping MEPs informed of the work of both committees by the provision of documents minutes and agendas and the introduction of a procedure whereby if Parliament passed a resolution taking the view that the Commission exceeded its legislative powers then the Commission should take the utmost account of the European Parliaments position a procedure which he admitted did not amount to a formal call back position but would in practice amount to the same thing At the same time he could not envisage the Commission ignoring Parliaments view In the ensuing discussions attention focussed on whether or not this amounted to sufficient controls on the Commission and the proposed European Securities Committee One fear is that this new body which Mr LAMFALUSSY recommends should be chaired by the Commission but composed of high level national civil servants of state secretary level would be the key decisionmaking body responsible for the technical details and under the control of national governments The report will be discussed at the March plenary and the committee will meet again next week with a view to proposing a draft resolution to plenary Bank regulator intervenes in Turkish crisis Financial Times March By Leyla Boulton Uncertainty over the Turkish governments next steps in the economic crisis gripping the country continued yesterday as the Ankara Chamber of Industry said foreign companies were refusing to accept letters of credit issued by Turkish companies Local banks were also reported to be freezing personal and company loans and the use of credit cards In its first move since the crisis erupted last week the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency took control of a small troubled bank Ulusal Bank while Bulent Ecevit prime minister expressed the hope Ankara could secure a Dollars bn loan from foreign banks to help it through the crisis Separately the government expressed hope that Kemal Dervis a top Turkish economist at the World Bank in Washington would accept the job of central bank governor The post has been vacant since Gazi Ercel the former governor resigned last weekend after the government was forced to allow the free float of the Turkish lira Turkish officials are now negotiating with the IMF and World Bank a revised disinflation plan together with a bank restructuring strategy But they are not expected to make any announcements before the start on Monday of the weeklong religious holiday of Eid alAdha and before the central bank governor and treasury chief are replaced Despite Mr Ecevits optimism over future loans analysts and bankers said it was more important for the government to show it was serious about economic reform in general and bank restructuring in particular Apart from implementing radical fiscal measures and privatisation this meant closing any other unhealthy institutions among privately owned Turkish commercial banks to counter the twin shock of a big jump in interest rates followed by a devaluation If the bad banks are not closed down they will ruin the market for the healthy ones said one senior banker who declined to be identified Aluk Akdogan analyst at Salomon Smith Barney concurred saying the countrys four biggest private banks still seen as sound accounted for per cent of the industrys Dollars bn equity But their net foreign exchange liabilities which he estimated as not exceeding per cent of their equity base could become more difficult to trim if weak banks were allowed to continue to drain available liquidity The government also faces the challenge of dealing with four stateowned banks that account for per cent of deposits and have accumulated historic losses of at least Dollars bn But analysts say dealing more effectively with the stateowned banks also risks uncovering corruption which could in turn hurt individual members of the threeparty coalition government This is above all a crisis of political leadership said Charles Blitzer an economist who follows Turkey closely Slightly Altered Bankruptcy Bill Clears Senate Committee American Banker March By Nicole Duran WASHINGTON The Senate Judiciary Committee cleared the bankruptcy overhaul bill Wednesday eliminating one sticking point but leaving several others for Thursdays anticipated floor action The legislation appears headed for passage in both chambers Theyre not going to stop it Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch said of the bills opponents after the committees lOto vote in favor of the bill The Utah Republican said that opponents could slow the legislation down but predicted they will ultimately fail unless the entire process breaks down and there is no bipartisanship The House cleared the way for a vote on its version of the bankruptcy bill Wednesday afternoon and was expected to begin debate this morning The Senate Judiciary Committee accepted some Democratic amendments Wednesday most notably one by Sen Charles Schumer DNY that would prohibit people convicted of crimes from filing for bankruptcy to avoid paying courtordered fines penalties or damages Similar amendments that specifically applied to people convicted of violence against abortion clinics held up identical bankrupt cy legislation in the th Congress before it eventually passed only to be pocketvetoed by thenPresident Clinton Sen Schumer modified his amendment to eliminate all specific references to abortion He scored again when the committee unanimously agreed to adopt his netting amendment The provision is designed to limit the damage that can occur when a company that holds derivatives contracts files for bankruptcy Under current law derivative contracts are frozen in a bankruptcy proceeding which prevents creditors of a bankrupt institution from settling their obligations The amendment would allow creditors to reconcile or net out their derivatives contracts and thus reduce their losses Sen Hatch and Sen Patrick Leahy of Vermont the ranking Democrat on the committee collaborated on an amendment to protect consumer privacy Their amendment adopted on a voice vote would prohibit companies filing for bankruptcy from selling client lists containing personal information such as Social Security numbers as a way to pay off creditors The provision also would create a consumer privacy ombudsman to protect consumers interests in bankruptcy court Sen Leahy said the ToySmartcom case revealed the need for such a provision The company had a privacy statement assuring customers that personal information would be kept confidential but when it went under the bankruptcy judge ordered it to sell one of its only assets its customer list to pay off its debts Sen Leahy said Sen Russ Feingold DWis a vocal bankruptcy opponent got about half his amendments approved outright and agreed to save some of his more controversial provisions for the Senate floor Two of his victories concern farming One of his amendments would make it easier for farmers to qualify for more lenient Chapter terms by lowering the amount of a filers income that comes from farming operations to from and by doubling the debt limit to million The other would ensure that any bankruptcy payment plan leaves a farmer with enough money to continue farming The panel also agreed to a modified version of Sen Feingolds amendment dealing with renters eviction during bankruptcy proceedings The committees work Tuesday and Wednesday still left about half of Democrats odd amendments to be tackled on the Senate floor Some of the more nettlesome outstanding points concern whether bankruptcy filers can keep expensive homes and how much information credit companies must provide consumers about interest rates and minimum payments End of ISDA Press Report for March THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF ISDAS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

Passes Bankruptcy Reform BNA Whats A Default Derivatives Strategy Derivatives Give Extra Nudge To Falling Nikkei Reuters Fed Study Hints Credit Risks Correlation Should Tighten Dow Jones March NEW YORK Dow Jones Banks should be prepared to tighten the coordination between credit risks they are exposed to in different markets as they adapt to the changing requirements of the Basel Accord on capital requirements a Federal Reserve study says Specifically the report cites exposure to derivatives as one area where broader and more tightly integrated models of credit risk are likely to be a future requirement for banks Especially in such cases of positions that involve derivatives banks credit risk models should reflect not only the uncertainty in future exposures but also the potential correlation of exposures across credits the paper says The New York Federal Reserve study entitled Using Credit Risk Models For Regulatory Capital Issues And Options is for future publication in a forthcoming Economic Policy Review The goal of this paper is to generate discussion and air alternative scenarios among regulators and among banks as they adapt their credit risk models in future said a coauthor of the report Beverly Hirtle vice president at the New York Federal Reserve for banking studies speaking with Dow Jones Newswires Wednesday Other coauthors were Mark Levonian a director in the Banking Supervision and Regulation Division at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Marc Saidenberg a Bank Supervision officer and Stefan Walter a vice president at the New York Fed and David Wright an assistant director of the Banking Supervision and Regulation Division at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System When questioned Hirtle said the studys reference to derivatives and to the possible need for some banks to tighten correlations among different instruments of credit risk going forward wasnt based on specific events or problems in the financial sector Derivatives exposures were one factor that made a number of banks and companies vulnerable to financial shocks during the s including Barings Bank German company Metallgesellschaft Japans Sumitomo Bank and the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management For positions that involve derivatives or that otherwise depend to a material extent on market factors standards likely would require integrated models of market movements and credit exposures the report said Unlike exposures to loans exposures to derivatives can change more rapidly Hirtle said Correlating Different Loans Is Key Hirtle stressed the importance of banks correlating the levels of credit risk among loans to different borrowers When a loan to a particular borrower has a rating in a banks internal ratings system and the bank then decides that loan is is better or worse than previously then if you looked across all of the loans in a banks books that tends to mean other credits are also being downgraded or upgraded Hirtle said That correlation is a very important factor in the risks facing banks and one which many banks are already aware of Hirtle added She also gave an example in general terms of how a chain of events might lower the worth of a credit for a bank A firm might be downgraded by a credit ratings agency and they might draw down on a line of credit from a bank so the banks exposure goes up and the value of the loan goes down Hirtle said Thats an example of how three factors can move against a bank at the same time she added Banks adaptation of their internal controls to monitor risk will be partly driven by changes to an international agreement on the subject The coming revisions to the Basel Accord planned for introduction by aim to update the way that banks globally account for risk The new version of that agreement will likely incorporate a greater reliance on banks internal risk rating systems in assessing regulatory minimum capital requirements the Fed paper said Derivatives Give Extra Nudge to Falling Nikkei Reuters English News Service By Risa Maeda A plunge in the Tokyo stock market partly reflects hedge selling related to equity derivatives products analysts said on Friday forecasting more such sales ahead if the benchmark Nikkei average crumbles further Selling related to derivatives products mainly structured bonds with returns linked to the Nikkeis level has gathered steam since the Nikkei dipped below the analysts said On Friday it stood at a year low The so called Nikkeilinked bonds have grown especially popular in the last two years as cashrich individual investors hunger for returns beyond current rockbottom interest rates offered by conventional government debt Financial Services Minister Hakuo Yanagisawa said on Friday that the recent sharp drop in share prices was due in part to trading in equity derivatives products Equity derivatives products have been accelerating the decline in Japans stock market Yanagisawa said Nobuaki Kurisu chief fund manager at Sumisei Global Investment Trust Management also cited derivatives related selling as a factor in the stock markets plunge and added that such selling should keep market volatility high for the time being making institutional investors hesitant to buy Analysts said speculators have been selling Nikkei futures contracts in the past weeks trying to nudge the Nikkei average to predetermined

to one year offer higher interest rates than ordinary bonds if the Nikkei stays above a predetermined level But once the Nikkei drops below that level the return at the bonds maturity will be lower

stock certificates carrying latent losses causing many investors to unload the unwanted certificates in an already bearish market Yen House Passes Bankruptcy Reform BNA March By Adam Walsh Three years in the making sweeping bankruptcy reform legislation HR passed the House March sending waves of contentment through much of the financial services sector and the ranks of Republicans none of whom voted to oppose the measure In the end Democrats crossed party lines to support the bill which has moved through the House before only to be pocket vetoed by former President Clinton last year The majority of Democrats opposed the measure deploring it for its treatment of lower and middleincome Americans who depend upon bankruptcy to achieve a fresh start A Democratic replacement amendment which Rep F James Sensenbrenner Jr RWis said would eviscerate the present bill was defeated Also the House moved to defeat a motion by Rep John Conyers DMich the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee to recommit the bill back to committee Conyers proposed a measure limiting the marketing of credit cards to those who are under This bill seeks to restore personal responsibility and integrity to the bankruptcy system and ensure these laws are fair to both debtor and creditors Sensenbrenner said following the bills passage Abuse of the current systemestimated to cost the rest of us approximately billion each yearis the driving force behind this bipartisan balanced and comprehensive legislation In a statement Edward L Yingling executive director of the American Bankers Association said ABA is very pleased to see bankruptcy reform pass the House today by such a broad bipartisan margin Saying the current bankruptcy code permits individuals with higher incomes to walk away from debts he called bankruptcy reform an urgent matter because the system is broken and needs to be fixed In general HR and S its companion bill in the Senate seek to force more bankruptcy filers to file under Chapter which requires some repayment of debts instead of Chapter which discharges most debts Means Test Main Feature of Measure Before moving off the House floor three substantive amendments were made to HR in addition to one technical amendment The first which passed by voice vote and was offered by Rep Sheila JacksonLee DTexas adds a debtors monthly public school expenses as an allowable expense under the bills means test and puts public school expenses on an equal footing with that of private school expenses which is already included in the bill The means test is the reform measures primary feature It is designed to serve as a kind of calculation device to determine who can file under Chapter and who can file under Chapter A second and third amendment also passed by voice vote Offered by Rep Mark Green RWis the second amendment would remove the names of children from bankruptcy filings in order to shield minors from wouldbe predators The final substantive amendment offered jointly by Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael Oxley ROhio and the committees ranking member Rep John J LaFalce DNY aims to reduce uncertainty and limit systemic risk in the banking system by simplifying the terms for settling large financial contracts in the event that one counterparty becomes insolvent Former House Banking Committee Chairman James A Leach RIowa rose to support the bill citing this sole amendment as reason enough to do so A similar amendment was made to the legislation during markup in the Senate Judiciary Committee Feb Both amendments conform legal definitions throughout the body of law that cover the bankruptcy of large financial institutions House Majority Leader Dick Armey RTexas rose to support the bill saying it was a matter of enormous pride that the House adopt bankruptcy reform legislation Rep Mel Watt DNC took a different view alleging that the bill was the result of special interests At the end of the day this bill will not be amended because it is a political statement Watt said on the floor People who wanted this bill knew that they could not get it unless they exempted the poorest people from the system Watt referred to a portion of the bills means test that exempts wage earners who make less than half of their states median income The establishment of two classes of debtorsone poorer and one richerwould be the lasting legacy of this bill Watt said Rep Jerrold Nadler DNY called the bill a poster child for campaign reform legislation Commenting on the House rule that limited debate on HR Rep Adam Schiff DCalif said the House was delegating its legislative responsibilities to the Senate The bill now must wait until the Senate passes its version before a conference can be appointed to work out differences between the two bills see related report in this section Whats a default Derivatives Strategy February By Barclay T Leib Credit derivatives only came into existence in the latter half of the Os and the documentation behind the product has been lightly tested But on September last fall some credit derivatives traders got a rude wakeup call That was the day Bank of America and Chase announced the extension of billion in loans to the troubled Conseco Corp While this helped Conseco avoid an immediate bankruptcy declaration and sent the companys bonds modestly higher the loan extension was technically deemed a restructuring As such it was also deemed a credit eventwhich allowed some fastfooted dealers to deliver longdated Conseco securities against credit default swap agreements Bonds that had previously been trading at a handle could suddenly be tendered at par Since credit default events had been rare to that point Rite Aid Armstrong Corp and schoolbus manufacturer Laidlaw being the only three highprofile examplesseveral banks were caught completely offguard by the Conseco situation I think there was a gentlemans perception that this loan restructuring should not have caused a default trigger even though the nittygritty of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association document clearly allowed it to be such notes a credit derivatives broker Even fewer dealers thought it was an appropriate response to get delivered longerdated paper when it was a shortterm loan that got extended Ever since the usefulness of credit default swaps has been called into question and the market has been abuzz with proposed language changes to the ISDA derivatives document For all the deal flow these days its suddenly become apparent that many people arent entirely sure what it is theyve been trading Is this a product that is supposed to pay off on credit impairment or is it a product intended to protect capital in case of a cataclysmic inability to recover ones principal Most people believe it should be the latter but the Conseco event suddenly raised disparate interests and views that previously had been shoved under the rug Tailormade contracts with specific restructuring provisionseither included or notcan always be designed and traded but suddenly no one knows what the standard documentation for the interdealer market should beand that has regulators and industry groups scrambling for answers In a research report called Restructuring A Defining Event for Synthetic CDOs dated December the rating agency Fitch even stated that recent developments may eventually necessitate changes in its rating criteria for credit derivatives and the collateralized debt obligations into which they are sometimes packaged According to Roger Merritt managing director in Fitchs global loan products group a narrower definition as to what constitutes a credit event or the complete elimination of restructuring should in fact correspond with a lower incidence of credit protection payments for synthetic CDOs and credit derivatives Important insurance Credit default swaps stipulate that in one of several possible eventsthe declaration of a bankruptcy the failure to pay interest on a loan or bond or the restructuring repudiation or acceleration of a loan that lowers the overall creditworthiness of a counterpartythe buyer of the swap may deliver to the seller any loan or bond extending out to a predefined maturity and receive back par value in return In a market where it can be difficult and timeintensive for bank portfolio managers to resell an actual loan this is an important and attractive product for lenders Although delivery is typically based on physical settlement of loans or bonds at their par value contracts are sometimes written for cash settlement of par value minus any recovery from the sale of the asset Because of the product loan portfolio managers on both sides of the Atlantic have morphed in recent years into active traders while insurance company and hedge fund managers gained a new way to position themselves Within the credit default swap contract restructuring is clearly a trigger event important to many commercial banks There are increasing pressures on banks to mark loans to market and when a loan is restructured it is clearly a loss of valueoften a step taken just to avoid an immediate default explains Hetty Harlan a managing director in charge of credit derivatives trading for BofAs portfolio management group Harlan thus considers structurings de facto or prepackaged defaults and a legitimate credit event under standard ISDA document Such loans become expensive to hang onto in terms of loan loss reserves or chargeoffs she explains so we need to have some relief at that point to help mitigate the risk of doing so Nobody wants to throw a company into bankruptcy if theres a glimmer of hope that a company may turn around with time Banks shouldnt be in a position where they have to push for default because restructuring does not qualify for relief That is in nobodys best interest Not everyone in the credit market thinks this issue is quite that simple and straightforward however According to sources close to the Conseco situation Bank of America was actually the first institution to start delivering Conseco paper against long credit default swaps it had previously purchased Harlan claims the bank only delivered the restructured loans but other sources say BofA delivered the cheapest bonds it could get its hands on Merrill Lynch quickly followed But since Bank of America also had a hand in the loan extension some cried foul at the potential conflict of interest Since the loan was renegotiated on the last day of the contract BofA certainly could have considered it a repaid loan and then extended a new loan if it had wanted to couch it in such terms says one dealer That path would have avoided the technical default In lieu of that however Bank of America termed the extension a restructuring and quickly delivered Conseco paper to get it off its books At the end of the day calling the Conseco loan a restructuring was probably the commercially normal thing for BofA to have done ventures another senior dealer It knew the implications of its actions and coincidentally was happy to benefit This is a financial market not a social club You have to have compelling bigpicture incentives for people not to do shortterm things in their economic best interest Nonetheless these events highlight a moral hazard issue and more than a few fund and insurance sellers of credit derivatives protection felt burned After all how can a bank extend a loan collect big fees for doing so then come crying to the market that they need added compensation under their credit default swaps Many think theres something fundamentally wrong here Moreover they argue if Bank of America had been short credit default swaps instead of long might it have potentially followed a different path that would have once again benefited its own book but potentially left those actually betting on a Conseco default with less satisfaction Slow down dont move too fast A s a result of this debate many USbased dealers last MOctober petitioned for the complete removal of restructuring as a trigger event in credit derivatives documentation Not long after these dealers started quoting standard credit derivative contracts with the restructuring language removed The broker market became a twotier market of credit default swaps with restructuring and without restructuring But many again cried foul I was very taken aback says BofNs Harlan A credit default swap without a trigger for restructuring is a much less valuable instrument to us By proposing such a change dealers were just trying to simplify and provide a quick fix to the problem issue But this quick fix would truly eat away at the contracts very usefulness to many buyersparticularly banks Since then Harlan has continued to insist that restructuring be included in all new contracts she enters into European credit derivative participants also balked at the new direction decided upon by their American counterparts The European capital markets contain a much higher percentage of bank loans vs bond debt and few bankers want to lose the protection of a loan restructuring clause as a trigger for credit default swaps After all isnt a loan restructuring just one step removed from outright bankruptcy And if people dont recognize it as such whats the point of buying credit protection in the first place The result to date of this Continental drift all credit derivatives transacted between US and European counterparties continue to include restructuring in the documentation But many contracts negotiated solely between US counterparties do not The credit derivatives market has effectively bifurcated itself into two distinctly different products and although it hasnt yet reached a critical stage participants are concerned that this bifurcation may start to hurt overall market liquidity Regulator warnings If the rancor from European bankers was not already loud I enough the global regulatory community also posted a strong stop sign in front of the without restructuring contracts At the ChaseDerivatives Strategy Credit Derivatives Conference in midNovember Federal Reserve Board official Thomas Boemio threw down the proverbial gauntlet If restructuring is taken out of ISDA documentation he said the Fed will ignore credit derivatives for purposes of capital relief There were loud oohs and aahs from the bankers and dealers in the audience at Boemios pronouncement After all credit derivatives were born very much to help banks satisfy Fedmandated regulatory capital requirements Take that regulatory relief away and core demand for the product would certainly be reduced Since that conference dealers have met many more times to try to hash things out ISDA executive director and CEO Bob Pickel traveled to London in early December to try to smooth the ruffled feathers of European bankers At the first of those meetings held in the stately Fleet Street offices of Goldman Sachs several European bankers explained that French regulatory officials had joined the Feds Boemio in reiterating that credit derivatives documentation needs to retain loan restructuring default clauses in order to be deemed good offset to a loan or bond position Such news caused further groans from dealing participants across the Atlantic I dont think the Fed or the Commission Banquaire the French regulator have truly thought out their position on this says one senior credit derivatives dealer at a major New York investment bank Since all bank loans can only be restructured with the percent approval of those holding these loans wheres the harm in allowing capital relief at least until such a restructuring transpires In other words if a bank has a twoyear loan covered by a twoyear credit default swap that bank would naturally agree to a loan extension only on terms attractive to it If not offered such terms it would simply demand repayment of the loan even if such demands forced the company into bankruptcy For its part the Fed seems to have larger issues of fairness and security in mind It doesnt want banks to appear to have capital protection after buying credit default swaps only to be forced to effectively abandon such protection by a corporate counterpart playing hardball in a loan renegotiation process For example would a bank give up its collection rights on a million credit default swap if it had billion in total loans that could be thrown into the nonperforming category by a bankruptcy declaration Without a hard and fast rule that a loan restructuring is a credit event it might feel obliged to do so A pendulum Over its short history credit derivatives documentation has swung from being overly vague to potentially too specific ISDAs initial credit derivative definitions drafted in as an addendum to the ISDA master derivatives document stipulated that in order to trigger a credit event the change in the terms of any loan or bond obligation had to result in terms that were materially less favorable to any holders of the obligation Many deemed this language too vague and subjective it tended to encourage litigation rather than avoid it After the turmoil surrounding Russian paper which many viewed as a default but some called a period of acute market stressthere was general agreement in to try to tighten up the documentation language Very specific definitions of a credit event were introduced Even then some participants were not fully confident of the new verbiage but after much discussion exhaustion ruled People grew so sick of the debate on restructuring that in the end it was just easiest to go with the new definitions and come back to the issue at a later date says Richard Kennaugh cohead of credit derivatives trading at Chase Securities At the time the definitions were thought to at least be better than what was used before The definitions lasted all of months before hitting their first stumbling block Now participants complain that the definition of a credit default actually became far too precise back in The Conseco situation showed how a technical default could trigger a credit derivatives exercise but without the debt of the underlying company being truly hurt At the center of the snafu is the presumption that when a bank loan is restructured all other corporate debt becomes harmed and thus due and payable Events have clearly proven otherwise not only has Conseco not fallen into bankruptcy but its various tranches of debt and bonds continue to trade at markedly different valuations in the market Almost every major institution wants some change to the restructuring language now says Kennaugh The status quo is not an acceptable option We have to establish a better standard for interdealer business or risk less liquidity and a great deal of added basis risk within dealer books Although achieving consensus will not be easy Kennaughs hope is that some standard acceptable to investors hedgers and dealers alike can be established Then anything different from that standard will continue to be available in the market at a premium or discounted price depending upon the specific language used The milliondollar question So what should ISDA do to set the credit derivatives market back on course There are two basic pathswith numerous permutations buried withinthe trade group could take First it could try to narrow the definition of restructuring and limit the deliverability under a restructuring to the actual loans or bonds in question or to paper with a shorter tenor than the restructuring period The language to accomplish this might require some tricky drafting but the goal would be to give sellers of credit derivatives more solace that they could not be blindsided on a loan restructuring with the delivery of longerdated paper while the buyers of credit default swaps would still maintain the regulatory ability to tender restructured paper This compromise however could create a twostep delivery option On the occasion of a loan restructuring the holder of a credit default swap might be able to either tender the actual loan affected or a similar shortterm piece of debt or hold onto the credit derivative for the possibility of an actual bankruptcy event at a later date If bankruptcy eventually transpired then any paper out to a predefined maturity would be renderable In other words there could be one central contract but with a new delivery twist within it That might be a possible outcome says BofAs Harlan But banks are so conservative I think almost everyone would exercise the credit derivative on the first goround The pressure just to get troubled debt off ones books would dominate the potential reward of gleaning even greater value from the default swap later on Others arent so sure this solution would work It might introduce too much uncertainty into the delivery process People want to know what they are going to get and when says Hilmar Schaumann head of credit derivatives trading for Swiss Re New Markets in New York At the moment credit default swaps can be triggered by either the buyer or seller of the swap in order not to leave the seller hanging with a contingent liability If a narrowed restructuring delivery option is introduced it is likely that only the buyer of the default swap would have the power to decide whether to deliver a specific restructured loan Some also argue that to be completely fair the party long the credit default swap and tendering the loan should be forced to hand over any added fees collected from the restructuring This is not currently standard practice The inclusion of a materiality clause is another possible permutation of the restructuring language being bandied about Such a clause could stipulate that a restructuring only be considered a default event if the credit rating of the underlying corporate entity subsequently deteriorates beyond a stated level Given the large range of potential underlying credits however the specific drafting required here might be even more difficult for participants to agree on in advance The other major alternative would be to continue allowing the two contractsone with restructuring and the other withoutto simply develop of their own accord with Darwinian forces of supply and demand deciding which is more useful and popular as a core product Restructuring would just become another checkbox among many on the ISDA document that people could either use or ignore Such an approach might result in more documentation mismatches and basis risk on dealer books but it might also keep diverse enduser participants more satisfied ISDA cannot unilaterally tell the market what it should use says Jeremy Barnum head credit derivatives trader at JP Morgan People will trade what contracts they want to trade and we may have to wait to see which contract that will be There is a perception that without regulatory capital relief the market just dies but that is patently wrong Banks are increasingly a small percentage of the market If banks still want relief with restructuring included that price exists today and will continue to exist It just may not be the standard contract anymore It is possible of course that the market will end up with a refined restructuring definition and a checkbox approach to whether restructuring is included in a deal or not Barnum for one thinks it is unrealistic to expect a single contract that unifies bank loan people and bond investorstwo groups with fundamentally different needs and desires But ISDA had the foresight to structure its document in a menu framework where you can check off prepackaged definitions he says so were likely just headed to another checkbox solution maybe with some improved definitions within Whatever ISDA decides it must do so quickly before other credit derivative problems pop up A year ago for example Xerox credit default swaps were trading at just basis points per annum Now they are basis points bid with no offer Overall Xerox has billion in out standing debt and is quickly approaching full usage of its bank lines of credit Separately many of its interest rate and equity swap agreements have embedded credit clauses that will force it to liquidate these contracts should it be downgraded below a certain credit rating Its easy to imagine yet another situation where Xerox may technically fall into default on certain obligations but continue to pay interest on other paper It is also noteworthy that Conseco credit default swaps involved only a few hundred million dollars in notional obligations while the outstanding amount of credit derivatives written on Xerox is quite a bit greater Lawsuits havent sprung from the Conseco situation but they could for Xerox since there is more money on the table Were just starting to see the world of distressed securities realize that some of these clauses that many thought didnt matter actually matter a great deal says Leslie Rahl president of Capital Market Risk Advisors Xerox in particular may be a good example of documentation language that was intended to protect counterparties in a downgrade situation but now may have unintended negative consequences if these clauses actually get triggered Rahl acknowledges that credit trigger levels need to be precise but she also worries that they introduce a certain amount of systemic risk Given the proclivity of rating agencies to downgrade whole industry sectors at the same time she says credit triggers are the one thing in my mind that could cause systemic risk and bring on required kneejerk reactions While ISDA is at it some also think that language revolving around successor corporations should be examined ISDA documentation provides that after a merger spinoff or other corporate restructuring a credit derivative will apply to the surviving corporation that inherits the majority of the original debt But what happens to a credit derivative contract if say ATT gets split into four equal parts with equal debt loads Perhaps the credit derivative should really be split into pieces as well particularly given the massive debt load to be transferred Unfortunately ISDA must work in a world in which financial nuances wreak havoc on derivatives contracts originally designed to be relatively simple and fungible Have you every tried to cash in an insurance policy asks Rahl If you havent read the fine print its not always as easy as it should be she says This is what the credit derivatives market is currently grappling with In other words credit derivatives documentation may have worked reasonably well in good times but what happens in bad Thats an important question given the current spate of earnings warnings and massive corporate debt loads If more credit problems flare up soon ISDA documentation will likely come under even more scrutiny with Conseco simply having been the first warning shot across the bow of the credit derivatives market In a litigious society where a presidential election can be contested for six weeks dont expect an easy path to defining when a real default begins and mere credit impairment ends Scott Marra Administrator for Policy Media

Basel Rqmts Now Dow Jones A ragbag of reform The Economist No taste for risk Are markets rejecting their traditional role Financial Times SEC to toughen reports scrutiny Financial Times March By John Labate Securities regulators in the US plan to step up their scrutiny of company financial reports in response to changes in economic and corporate conditions The move comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC finds its accounting review resources freed up by the slowdown in filings for initial public offerings that were once the agencys main target Last year companies faced a onein chance of being reviewed by SEC accountants but the aim this year is to review as many as one in three reports The change could mean companies face tougher inspection on a range of accounting issues that in the past might have gone unnoticed Among the issues to get a heightened review are revenue disclosures credit risk reporting hedging techniques and derivatives exposures SEC enforcement officials are also expected to raise their surveillance of financial fraud as new trends in manipulation of earnings have begun to emerge Annual reports are more likely to be selected for review this year said Robert Bayless chief accountant at the SECs division of corporate finance Were returning to the historical norm after a twoyear period of focusing on initial public offering issues In the last five years some of the biggest financial frauds have been uncovered against companies such as Cendant and McKesson HBOC Tens of billions of dollars in market value have been lost as a result SEC officials have disclosed that more than financial fraud investigations are under way and that more highprofile cases are likely to be announced soon We are finding more ingenious ways that revenues are being improperly enhanced said Charles Niemeier chief accountant at the SECs division of enforcement Another area of investigation involves corporate earnings warnings and how long a company might wait before disclosing news to investors One unnamed company being investigated is said to have waited nine months before revealing a warning Few Banks Could Meet New Basel Rqmts Now Dow Jones March By Jonathan Nicholson WASHINGTON Dow Jones Federal Reserve Gov Laurence Meyer on Monday criticized the internal riskassessment capabilities of US banks Meyer in prepared remarks to be delivered to a meeting of the Institute of International Bankers here also said few US banks would qualify now for the relaxed treatment proposed under a new international agreement on how banks are regulated That proposed update to the socalled Basel Capital Accord is expected to be effective in Meyers prepared remarks didnt touch on monetary policy or the economic outlook The proposed update to the Basel Accord was released in January It calls for a threepronged approach to bank regulation involving a new capital standard increased scrutiny of a banks own internal assessment of its capital levels and increased disclosure of risks to the marketplace Banks would be allowed to use an internal ratingsbased approach for some capital requirements But Meyer said that would only work for banks with good riskmeasuring capabilities As bankers you should ask yourselves whether you are truly ready The quick answer were there is probably wrong Meyer said Based on our examinations of US banks internal riskrating processes I suspect that few banks would or should get a clean signoff from their supervisor today Meyer said banks have been surprisingly slow to link acceptable credit risks and assessments of capital adequacy he said The processes banks use to make internal grades of credit risks are also lacking he said Most significantly the rigor and internal consistency of the internal riskrating process is often handicapped by insufficient or unclear rating criteria or by limited resources dedicated to independent reviews of riskrating assignments he said Meyer urged banks to comment on the proposal now while it is still undergoing development Once adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision it will be submitted to the central banks of the worlds largest economic powers Meyer said After that in the US it will go through the usual rulemaking process The proposal may be complex and at times confusing but I believe we are on the right track We need regulatory capital standards that are far more risk sensitive than the one we have now and that provide the industry greater incentives to measure and manage risk he said A ragbag of reform The Economist March Across Europes financial markets lies a colourful patchwork of regulation In Austria a government department watches over the markets a task that the Irish leave to their central bank The French have two main regulators for their markets while the Germans have three With many countries still separating the regulation of banks insurers and securities firms there are about different authorities currently tying up EU member states with red tape These old structures however are changing The British set a brand new example last year when they introduced a single allpowerful regulator the Financial Services Authority FA to watch over all their financial markets And in February an influential EU group of wise men headed by Alexandre Lamfalussy a former chairman of the EMI forerunner of the European Central Bank endorsed the British model and recommended a single national regulator for each EU country That led some to wonder whether whats good for Britain might be good for Europe too Would the EU benefit from having a single superregulator The Lamfalussy group says that a single authority in each member state would bring economies of scale more streamlined management greater transparency and clearer accountability Most EU countries say they are heading towards that goal though so far only Denmark and Sweden have gone as far as Britain Belgium Luxembourg and Finland have merged the supervision of securities and banking but in seven EU countries a separate institution still regulates the securities markets The main motive for reform is clear a broader constituency for each regulator is expected to reduce the inefficiencies in Europes fragmented financial markets This fragmentation diminishes the depth and liquidity of the markets and makes the cost of capital in Europe persistently higher than it is in America It also makes it more difficult for entrepreneurs to find startup funds Per head of population there is five times as much venture capital available in America as there is in Europe America has one national regulator for its securities marketsthe Securities and Exchange Commission SEC But it has several regulators for other parts of the financial system The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation the Federal Reserve Board and the various state banking commissions all keep an eye on banks while state insurance commissions regulate insurance firms The regime is a mix of monopoly and fragmentation Debate on the reform of financial regulation in America has emerged at irregular intervals usually after the shock of a financial scandal Whenever something goes seriously wrongthe stock market crash in the collapse of the notorious Bank of Credit and Commerce International or the crash of LongTerm Capital Management in reform of financial regulation is hotly debated Until now though no evidently superior solution for the regulatory conundrum has prevailed So each country has been left to devise its own system American markets have by and large pioneered those developments in recent years that have made the regulators job much tougherrapid innovation internationalisation and the broadening range of businesses in which individual firms take part But none of these has led to radical reform The American regulatory system has not changed fundamentally since when the SEC was set up Two heads better than one Discussion of regulatory reform in Europe has a shorter history Most European regulators have not been established for long and change in financial markets has been slower than in America The pressure for reform has accelerated with the recent introduction of the single European currency and with technological progress The euro in effect a single financial market for cash has integrated national bond markets in the euro area and has begun to do the same for equities Investment managers now do their research on European bonds and equities by sector rather than by country At the same time changes in technology have replaced many of the old highdecibel trading floors with electronic trading platforms Supervising such markets is forcing regulators to rethink their traditional methods of regulation The British government eager to preserve the City of Londons leading role in financial services announced a reform of its system of regulation in For years the City had policed itself with selfregulatory organisations that covered both wholesale and retail financial services After a protracted debate about the wisdom of merging all these bodies into one supersupervisor the British parliament finally passed the unwieldy Financial Services and Markets Bill last year It is this legislation that established the pioneering FSA The idea of a single regulator is now spreading across Europe Hans Eichel the German finance minister wants to merge his countrys three regulatory bodies one each for banks insurers and securities houses into one Federal Agency for Financial Market Supervision However his plan is unpopular with state governments always sensitive to incursions into their prerogatives At the moment they oversee Germanys eight bourses the government of Hesse keeps an eye on the Frankfurt stock exchange for example while BadenWrttemberg watches over the bourse in Stuttgart The French too are talking about merging their regulators Frances main supervisory authority is the Commission des Operations de Bourse COB but it shares responsibility with two other bodies the Conseil des Marchs Financiers a self regulatory organisation that oversees market transactions and the Commission Bancaire the watchdog for the banking industry The French government is a strong proponent of the socalled twin heads model of regulationhaving one regulator for prudential supervision and wholesale business the markets for financial products between professionals and one for the retail markets where financial products are sold to consumers The head of the COB Michel Prada says that two separate regulatory bodies are preferable to one for two main reasons In the first place they reduce the risk of the retail market regulator being contaminated by its wholesale counterpart and vice versa And secondly they reduce the huge management burden that is imposed on a single regulator The COB has fewer than staff the FSA has around The EUS bureaucrats have been pursuing reform for much longer than their national counterpartsand with little to show for it so far In theory EU financial markets were supposed to be one single market from the first day of Remember the single market programme of directives At the time many of the measures that were required to create a single market in financial services together with more streamlined regulation were put in place Restrictions on capital movements had been largely dismantled and the European Commission had launched a series of passport directives designed to let banks insurers and stockbrokers offer their services directly across borders without setting up local subsidiaries All was in place for the single market in financial services to take off In practice however member states delayed the implementation of the directives or did not implement the bits that they did not like At first the commission reacted timidly to their recalcitrance setting up a feeble Forum of European Securities Commissions FEC in to promote cooperation among securities regulators FESCOs work has been inconsequential though largely because it does not have any official status It is further handicapped by being obliged to work by consensus and by being unable to make recommendations that are binding In the aftermath of the launch of the euro Europes leaders decided to take more robust action to tackle other financial markets They endorsed the European Commissions Financial Services Action Plan FSAP at their Lisbon summit in March a blueprint for integrated capital and financialservices markets across the EU The FAP recommends measures to streamline the regulation of retail and wholesale financial markets The latest deadline for their implementation is Not content with this deadline nor with the contents of the plan the French government decided to try both to tinker with it and to speed it up In the second half of last year when France held the presidency of the Council of Ministers Laurent Fabius the French finance minister suggested setting up a small committee to study the possibility of a more radical plan In it he wanted to include the establishment of a panEuropean regulator to be headquartered not surprisingly in Paris Britain was staunchly opposed to the setting up of such a committee and tried unsuccessfully to block it To calm Britains worries a British treasury official Sir Nigel Wicks was made a member of the committee that was eventually formed under Mr Lamfalussys chairmanship It produced an interim report last November and a final report in midFebruary Competing visions Despite all this activity neither national governments nor policymakers in Brussels have made up their minds about the best form of financial regulation for Europe Most EU member states now consider a single supervisor for all financial services to be the best solution within their own domain although there are those who want to keep regulation of the wholesale market apart from regulation of the retail side By the same token a panEuropean regulator would seem to be the most efficient way to put an end to Europes regulatory ragbag Yet the idea of competition between different jurisdictions offering their own brand of regulation has its supporters While the French campaign for a single European regulator Britains chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown is fiercely opposed to the idea The Germans are also in favour of a panEuropean regulator though they are less keen than the French Caio KochWeser a state secretary at the German finance ministry has said that at some stage a panEuropean regulator will be on the agenda By reforming its regulatory setup his country is to foreshadow that development Mr Lamfalussys group stops short of proposing a single regulator or even twin heads for the whole of the EUalthough its recommended creation of a securities committee to speed up the Eus cumbersome legislative procedures has been seen by some as an embryonic SEC This is an openended process says Mr Lamfalussy His committees report has only proposed measures that it thinks can be implemented in the next few years Mr Lamfalussy is he concedes a federalistbut a pragmatic one His group was not asked to come up with a counterproposal to the commissions FSAP Rather it was expected to highlight the most urgent measures needed to streamline the regulation of securities markets in the EU Hence the groups final report focuses on the modernisation of rules for investment and pension funds on the adoption of international accounting standards and on a single passport for stockmarkets Mr Lamfalussy wants all these reforms implemented by although he admits it will be tricky Other priorities on the list are less controversiala single prospectus for issuers the principle of mutual recognition for wholesale markets and the modernisation of exchanges listing requirements Ironically many of the groups recommendations have been under discussion for years or are in some cases already part of an EU directive Many of these proposals however came out halfbaked The key investmentservices directive for instance which sets conditions for a single EUwide license for investment firms and which empowers stock exchanges to operate across borders was watered down and implemented belatedly Although the directive was approved in after three years of tortuous wrangling many governments waited until to implement it In order to get it approved at all the commission had to tolerate many ambiguities in the text For instance something as basic as the definition of a professional investor is unclear Mr Lamfalussy makes much of the damage that has been done by the delays in tack ling what he calls priority measures National governments still stick to protectionist investment rules for investment and pension funds for example The Italian government requires that pension funds invest a considerable portion of the money that they manage in government bonds And multi national companies are obliged to run a different pension plan for their employees in each member state of the union As a result the average American investment fund is six times bigger than its European equivalent and between and the average real return on pension funds was in America and in EU countries that impose strict restrictions The people who suffer most from Europes protectionist rules are pensioners themselves And as more and more of them come to rely on privatesector schemes their loss will be even greater Mr Lamfalussy is also concerned about the damage that is being done by the continuing failure of most EU member countries to introduce rules on disclosure comparable to American standards This failure means that investors in the EU are not properly protected For instance information on the stock options granted to the directors of Lernout Hauspie a troubled Belgian company developing speechrecognition technology could only be found at the SECS EDGAR an electronic register in America that gathers and analyses data on companies flies Even the Belgian authorities that are investigating Lernout for allegedly inventing revenues had to turn to the SEC for help Karel Lannoo at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels is among those in favour of introducing a European EDGAR once the single European prospectus is a reality and once EU accounting standards are more homogeneous Almost stronger than the Lamfalussy committees desire to give new impetus to proposals for reform that in many cases have been discussed for years is its desire to accelerate decisionmaking procedures within the EU and to control more tightly the implementation of directives by member states At present the commission makes a legislative proposal to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament They then shunt it around in a complex codecision procedure that takes on average more than two years The takeover directive has been in the works for years and has still not been adopted while the European company statute has been discussed on and off for more than years Mr Lamfalussy calls for a fourlevel approach to decisionmaking and the implementation of financialmarket proposals At the first level the Council of Ministers the European Commission and the European Parliament would agree on framework legislation and would decide which of the measures to be implemented should be passed to the next level At this second level a newly created securities committee made up of representatives of the commission and of member states would reach agreement within three months on the technicalities of the new legislation This they would do after consulting market participants and consumers The government representatives on the securities committee should be just under the finance minister says Mr Lamfalussy Predictably the idea of such a committee has aroused the wrath of the European Parliament It worries that the committee will be come a means for removing important decisions from democratic accountability Levels three and four of the Lamfalussy approach to decisionmaking involve cooperation among national regulators via a regulators committee Its purpose will be to improve the implementation of EU legislation by the better enforcement of EU rules The timetable for the Lamfalussy plan is ambitious It is to be debated by the European Parliament in midMarch where it is unlikely to have a comfortable ride and it will then come before the European Council at its meeting in Stockholm at the end of March There the list of priorities in the plan is due to get the communitys stamp of approval The commission is then to begin setting up the securities committee and the regulators committee in April and May and by December the two committees should be in operation All Mr Lamfalussys recommendations are due to be implemented by a year earlier than the deadline of the commissions own action plan This is ambitious Even if Mr Lamfalussys fourlevel approach is simpler than the Kafkaesque co decision procedure currently in place it is still a complicated structure Moreover some of the measures on his priority list such as the move to international accounting standards are very likely to take more than two years to implement The role of the regulator The debate about financialmarket regulation in Europe has moved from considering the merits of selfregulation versus statutory regulation to whether a single regulator should police all financial services The Lamfalussy report has done nothing to help resolve this dilemma Financial regulation exists for three main reasons It is there to provide a safety net that will prevent the collapse of one bank insurer or investment manager triggering the failure of others It is also there to supervise the integrity of financial institutions and to protect individual consumers from malpractice and fraud And it is there to act as the watchdog of financial markets policing insider dealing malpractice and other offences If it is tricky for a single national authority to combine these different objectives of regulation it is even harder for a supranational regulator How can a single organisation hope to protect investors police financial institutions and watch markets in different jurisdictions Even if it were desirable to try some form of common jurisdiction would be essential On top of everything else a regulator has to be firm and effective to gain credibility If the EUS track record in enforcing its directives on financial regulation is anything to go by a pan European regulator would be neither No taste for risk Are markets rejecting their traditional role Financial Times March By Philip Coggan The collapse of Barings the Asian financial crisis of the dotcom mania of these events have created the idea that the financial markets are a Frankensteins monster wreaking havoc on the societies that created them Not so according to the author of this polemic Far from being a giant casino the financial system has become obsessed with controlling risk at the expense of fulfilling its proper function providing capital for business As a consequence the era of financial growth has coincided with that of a secular economic slowdown This is at the very least a refreshingly different take on the events of the past years The world in the authors view has too few risktakers not too many And Mr BenAmi assembles some solid building blocks for his case He points out quite rightly that equity markets have been taken over by fund managers who are obsessed with the business risk of matching the index and their peers rather than achieving the maximum return Banks have retreated from their function of providing risk capital to business in favour of the feeearning function of arranging bond issues The rise of the derivatives industry illustrates the extent to which companies and financial professionals have become obsessed with the aim of avoiding risk whether it comes in the form of interest rate and currency movements or changes in the weather BenAmi also points out that in the US and the UK at least stock markets have almost ceased to perform the function of providing capital to business In net terms capital has been returned to investors in the form of takeovers and share buybacks But just when you feel Mr BenAmi has the basis of a good case nagging doubts start to enter your mind How is he going to deal with the rise of the venture capital industry Or with the use of share options to motivate executives Or with the growth of day trading The answer is that he doesnt really address those issues In fact the case that the financial system is starving industry of funds has been made at various times over the last century but it has been extremely difficult to prove It seems a particularly ropey argument when one considers the events of the last decade Arguably the financial system was ludicrously keen to fund anyone with a laptop and a new economy idea the economy may now face a crisis of overinvestment There has been no shortage of funds for startups The amount of money invested by US venture capital groups rose from Dollars bn in to Dollars bn in And established groups have had no problems raising capital either international bond issuance in reached a record high of Dollars bn Arguably the decline of government bond issuance thanks to the improved finances of European and US governments has freed capital for industry It is also pretty hard to argue that risktaking in society has declined when one recalls how many executives and employees have left established companies for dotcom startups over the last couple of years Old economy businesses have also been happy to gear up taking on extra debt either through management buyouts or to increase the return on equity and satisfy the stock market Individuals have also been happy to take on greater debt in the UK and the US and to put a greater proportion of savings into equities albeit via collective schemes such as mutual funds Neither development suggests a riskaverse culture And while enthusiasm for developments such as online trading and spread betting may be confined to a small minority it still points to the existence of a strong gambling mentality Arguably the long bull market has blinded investors to the risks inherent in equity investment rather than making them too cautious It is also pretty hard looking at the record of the US over the last five years to say that economic growth has been sluggish One can argue about some of the productivity statistics and about the causes of the improvement but the US has nevertheless grown faster at a lower unemployment level and with scarcely any inflationary pressure than most economists would have thought possible a few years ago Mr BenAmis case might make more sense applied to Europe or the UK but the US is at the heart of financial market change if this thesis doesnt work there it doesnt work at all In short the author makes a much better case for the defence of the financial system than he does when attacking its pusillanimity Scott Marra Administrator for Policy Media Relations ISDA Fifth Avenue Rockefeller Center th floor New York

Modernization Act of CFTC Rule Proposal Would Establish ThreeTier Regulatory Regime for Markets Meyer Promotes Basel Committee Proposal CFTC Proposes Rules Implementing Commodity Futures Modernization Act of wwwcftcgov March Washington The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC today announced that it is proposing rules relating to trading facilities to implement the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of CFMA Congress on December passed and the President on December signed into law the CFMA which substantially altered the Commodity Exchange Act The CFMA amended the law to establish three categories of markets designated contract markets derivative transaction execution facilities and markets exempt from CFTC regulation The three categories match the degree of regulation to the varying nature of the products and the nature of the participant having access to the market The proposed new rules and rule amendments are being published in the Federal Register for a day comment period The Commission in its Federal Register notice urges commenters to submit their comments as early as possible during the comment period so that the statutory changes may be effectuated without delay Acting Chairman Newsome stated Todays release of these proposed revisions is an important step in fulfilling Congresss mandate to implement the CFMAs provisions without delay We look forward to a productive discussion of this release over the next days Copies of these documents can be obtained by contacting the Office of the Secretariat Three Lafayette Centre st Street NW Washington DC or by accessing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission website CFTC Rule Proposal Would Establish ThreeTier Regulatory Regime for Markets BNA March The Commodity Futures Trading Commission began the task of implementing the Commodity Futures Modernization Act CFMA by proposing a set of rules March aimed at making the commission more of an oversight agency than a frontline regulator The rule proposal would implement the new statutory framework establishing three new market categories including exempt markets and two categories of markets subject to CFTC regulatory oversight The remaining parts of the framework relating to clearing organizations and to intermediaries will be reproposed shortly the agency stated Core Principles The proposal establishes what the CFTC deems core principles that the exchanges would operate under It is meant to replace a onesizefitsall regulatory scheme that critics say hampers the US markets by making them overencumbered and ploddingunable to compete with a fastshifting international marketplace Now the exchanges will be segregated according to who trades on them and what is sold with varying degrees of oversight for the different tiers The hope is that the exchanges with the most sophisticated traders will be able to govern their own houses with the CFTC staying clear of most regulation The proposals effectively replace rules that were passed in December but that were rendered moot and withdrawn when Congress later that month passed similar legislation In effect the proposed rules establish three tiers of oversight for the various futures and options markets designated contract markets derivatives transaction execution facilities and exempt markets The designated contract markets are approved boards of trade or trading facilities on which contracts for future delivery on any commodity may be traded by any type of market participant according to the CFTCs Federal Register notice The next tier would consist of derivatives transaction execution facilities and would be open to traders of futures and option contracts on commodities that have a nearly inexhaustible delivery supply are highly unlikely to be susceptible to manipulation have no cash market and are security futures products This tier would have an intermediate level of oversight according to the proposal Finally commercial markets and boards of trade would be exempt signifying their relative sophistication in the markets Comments on the proposal are due days after Federal Register publication Innovation Competition The announcement makes clear the CFTCs intention to go from frontline regulator to a more behindthescenes oversight role Since his appointment acting Chairman James Newsome has stressed his belief in freemarket principles and the idea that freeing the exchanges from overzealous oversight would help them compete in the global marketplace In its release the commission said the proposal was intended to promote innovation maintain US competitiveness and at the same time reduce systemic risk and protect customers The commission also said the proposal would allow US exchanges greater flexibility in competing with technological innovations involving foreign competitors The proposal is the first portion of the CFMA to be taken up by the commission The legislation was passed in the waning moments of the previous Congress and it promises to drive much of the commissions agenda this year Meyer Promotes Basel Committee Proposal BNA March By Richard Cowden Addressing a group of banking officials in Washington DC March Federal Reserve Governor Laurence H Meyer actively promoted the new approach to international banking regulation represented by the recent proposal for major revisions to the Basel Accord In remarks to the Institute of International Bankers Meyer at once conceded that the Jan proposal by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is still very much a work in progress with important issues still unresolved while defending it as a necessary initiative to keep up with the times The Basel Accord has served its purpose Meyer said But technology and business practices have moved on and for the larger institutions this decadeold rule has developed critical shortcomings Riskmeasurement practices have improved and capital markets have become more tightly intertwined Assumptions and shortcuts taken in the current accord are far too crude given practices today A new regimen for setting international capital standards is needed he said because many large complex financial institutions today structure portfolios to arbitrage around the existing standard undercutting one of the original intents of the Basel Accord to establish capital ratios that reflect a banks actual strength Thus we need a capital framework that is more risksensitive and compatible with current market practices Meyer said Absolute levels of capital must be consistent with risk in order not to shift risktaking either away from or to banks but we also need a standard that better reflects relative levels of risk Meyer outlined the Basel Committees proposal which relies on a threepillar approach involving a new capital standard heightened supervisory review of banks own internal assessments of their capital ratios and increased public disclosures of risk portfolios The new proposal in effect increases the emphasis on the supervisors oversight of the institutions economic capital needs as it refines the calculation of the regulatory minimum he said Backs Controversial Pillar One of the innovative features of the proposal is that it would give banks the option of developing their own internal models for calculating capital adequacy Meyer said However such methods are expected to rely heavily on proper supervision During a recent meeting of the Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee this pillar of the Basel Committee proposal was called into question as a factor that could be compromised by pressures on individual national supervisory authorities Meyer said for someand perhaps for manysupervisors abroad implementing pillar will be an even greater challenge and a more significant event potentially introducing a material change in their role For all of us though it is the right approachrelying more than before on the internal measures and management practices of banks giving them more incentives to invest in better information systems and controls In regard to disclosure issues Meyer acknowledged the formative nature of the proposal He said we recognized that we still have more work to do in fashioning a more disciplined and prioritized set of disclosure requirements one that balances the cost of compliance against the benefits of disclosure This is an area in which bank comments on the Basel Committees proposal would be particularly helpful Jochen Sanio president of the Federal Banking Supervisory Office of Germany called the proposed revision of the Basel Accord a radical departure from a conventional approach to international banking regulation that relies almost entirely on standards that are set by regulators He predicted the new Basel Accord will take effect early in Basel II is not the end of the story Basel II is a first step a very big step forward but the revolution to quote Trotsky the revolution will be a permanent one And after Basel II there will be Basel III and IV And thats when we will talk about credit risk models I am convinced it will take the academics only some years to really perfect credit risk modeling and then it will be accepted Scott Marra Administrator for Policy Media Relations ISDA Fifth Avenue Rockefeller Center th floor New York NY Phone Fax Email

deadline Benchmark Tipping Is Favoring Swaps Over Treasurys It brings the products to the attention The New Forecast For Meteorologists Its Raining Job Offers McDonough says wont extend Basel deadline Reuters March LONDON March Reuters William McDonough chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said on Thursday he would not extend the consultation period for comments on the new Basel Capital Accord McDonough is also president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank He was in London for a British Bankers Association conference on the Basel accord A new accord designed to make capital adequacy rules for banks more risk sensitive was launched in January Banks and other interested groups were given until May to respond Many European banks have been critical of the short consultation period but McDonough has previously shrugged off this criticism arguing that banks were involved in developing the accord and a first proposal had been made in June The consultation period which we know is shortbut we are not going to extend it McDonough told a news conference The Basel Committee intends to finalise the new Capital Accord by the end of this year so it can be implemented in national jurisdictions in Benchmark Tipping Is Favoring Swaps Over Treasurys Dow Jones March By Michael Mackenzie NEW YORK Dow Jones The near collapse of hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in triggered a massive liquidity crisis in capital markets It also marked the beginning of the end for the role of Treasurys as a benchmark for pricing other debt securities and hedging for duration and volatility according to a study by the Bank of International Settlements BIS While the debate over alternative benchmarks for Treasurys has bounced between the relative merits of swaps and agency debt swaps appear to be winning the hearts and minds of a trading community that has learnt the lessons of hedging risk with Treasurys a point that the BIS seems to support In its report titled Benchmark Tipping In The Money And Bond Markets the BIS cited the bitter lessons in the aftermath of the LTCM meltdown as a direct cause for the ascendancy of interest rate swaps at the expense of Treasury securities as a benchmark for capital markets And though the question of swaps replacing Treasurys has been discussed since the US government announced its debt buyback program the thrust of the BIS report is that such a move was perhaps inevitable More recently the bond market has shifted away from its reliance on government securities and might well have continued to do so even if there had been no reduction in the stock of outstanding US government paper writes the BIS In fact the BIS said the burgeoning popularity of swaps is creating a powerful vortex within capital markets Each market participant who gives up using US Treasuries to hedge private instruments subtracts liquidity from the Treasury market and adds it to the swap market thus raising the incentives for other market participants to do likewise writes the BIS History On Their Side With history acting as a guide the BIS has observed that the benchmark is tipping from Treasury paper to the swap The BIS cited two precedents for benchmark tipping when market participants migrate to using a private instrument such as an interest rate swap instead of a Treasury security The most recent event following the flight to quality rush by investors which resulted in the threemonth Eurodollar futures contract eclipsing the Treasury bill futures contract in terms of volume occurred on the heels of the LTCM near collapse Investors rapidly diluted their exposure to other credit securities and flocked to the safe haven of US Treasurys meaning that dealers shorting Treasurys against being long spread product including corporate bonds agency securities and mortgages discovered that their hedges melted down The lessons learned from these traumatic episodes in capital markets have been recently observed since December when mortgage investors primarily turned to swaps instead of Treasurys to hedge prepayment risks of mortgages in what is known as the negative convexity trade Estimates of swap volume by several investment banks since the mortgage hedging began total in the region of billion in terms of receiving a fixed rate of interest via a swap contract Valuation Versus Investment Benchmarks Swaps are being increasingly used by traders as a benchmark for valuation purposes hedging pricing and establishing relative value across different asset classes The swaps market is generally the province of the leveraged buyer whether hedge funds dealers or asset swappers wrote analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York in a research note last month Because levered investors determine the marginal bid for credit product swap spreads and not government securities have become the defacto benchmark for credit valuation Swaps perform like a synthetic bond and involve the exchange of two cash flow streams One leg comprises a fixed rate of interest priced as a spread over a Treasury security that is traded against a floating rate of interest pegged to the threemonth London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR Thus they are not a physical asset that can used as an investment benchmark acting as an index measuring excess returns by money managers Ultimately it will be up to money fund managers and not traders to determine whether swaps will become a viable benchmark said George Oomman derivatives strategist at Lehman Brothers Although the growing supply of debt issued by the Government Sponsored Agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently over trillion is a real asset the agencys remain susceptible to political pressure changing their charters and reducing their better than AAA rating The market is looking at swaps and should Treasurys continue to shrink the market will steadily move to swaps said Robert Auwaerter senior fixed income portfolio manager at The Vanguard Group in Malvern PA It brings the products to the attention Reuters March By Tom Bergin LONDON March Reuters A legal wrangle between Swiss bank UBS and Germanys Deutsche Bank AG over a credit derivative contract has highlighted concerns about potential risks in a relatively new sector of the market News this week of a lawsuit filed by UBS in Britains High Court of Justice comes at a time when the industry is trying to convince regulators to adopt more favourable treatment of credit derivatives in the updated Basel Accord on capital requirements This is illustrative of the general uncertainty of how this market works said Richard Boulton credit risk manager at the Financial Services Authority FSA the UKs financial services regulator There is not absolute certainty that these techniques will work all the time he said speaking earlier this week when news of the lawsuit filed in February came to light Draft proposals updating the Basel Accord treat risks on credit derivatives as greater than for more tried and tested means of hedging credit risk such as bank guarantees As a result they require more money to be set aside to cover risk The market body the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA is pressing Basel regulators for talks about aspects of the proposals which it says are unfair The case wont help the image of credit derivatives Well have to see how things develop but hopefully it wont have a negative influence on regulators said the head of credit derivatives at a European bank who declined to be named Regulators are concerned in particular about legal risk Bank of England deputy governor David Clementi said last month question marks existed over whether players had conflicting views on details of credit derivative deals they entered into and how the law courts would treat agreements such as credit default swaps A default swap is an insurancelike instrument which allows an investor to hedge exposure to the risk of an issuer defaulting on an underlying bond or loan In the UBS case the Swiss bank alleges Deutsche Bank is in default of its obligations to pay the sum of million in a default swap deal designed to pay if US building materials firm Armstrong World Industries Inc defaulted on its debt According to documents filed at the High Court UBS alleges written confirmation of the swap contract with Deutsche mistakenly lists AWIs parent Armstrong Holdings as the underlying issuer not AWI UBS alleges the true contract related to AWI which filed for Chapter protection from creditors more than half a year after the swap deal was transacted and not to Armstrong Holdings which has not filed for Chapter and has not defaulted Both banks have declined to comment on the lawsuit but credit derivative traders have been quick to reject any suggestion that the legal action supports the argument for harsher regulatory treatment of default swaps Disagreements between counter parties over the interpretation of what constitutes a default event have resulted in court action on a number of occasions In a notable case last year involving the US insurer Conseco counterparties disagreed over whether the insurers restructuring of debt constituted a default event The market is a relatively new industry and regulators are concerned some aspects of it like contract documentation have not been fully standardised leaving participants open to the risk of contractual disputes Banks and ISDA have worked to improve documentation ISDA is currently trying to nail down a definitive description of debt restructuring which has proven a particularly tricky issue While some market participants fear the market may be harmed by fallout from legal actions other experts in the sector are more sanguine The momentum of the credit derivative market is such that it will require more than these small problems to stop the market growing said Jonathan Davies head of credit derivatives at PricewaterhouseCoopers Thesetypes of cases made firms address the issues involved Davies said adding It brings the products to the attention of senior management and accelerates the evolution of the market The New Forecast For Meteorologists Its Raining Job Offers The Wall Street Journal March By Chip Cummins Two years ago Bradley Hoggatt was heading for an academic career in meteorology intent on discovering more about how hurricanes form But just before he started working on a doctorate a very different opportunity blew in Now Mr Hoggatt forecasts weather for a floor full of MBAs who trade billions of dollars in weathersensitive energy commodities such as natural gas and electricity for Aquila Inc the trading subsidiary of a big Midwest utility With no business background himself Mr Hoggatt is also trading complex financial contracts based on his predictions Im putting my money where my mouth is says the tall squareshouldered yearold Weathermen and women have become a hot commodity in the exploding energytrading business While offtarget forecasts on television may frustrate parents and schools and embarrass politicians as they did this week on the East Coast they can lose bundles for electricity and naturalgas traders So as trading has boomed so has demand for trained meteorologists a profession that traditionally hasnt paid all that well and is often the butt of jokes From Wall Street to Houstons Louisiana Street where many energy companies have set up shop recent graduates are earning twice what they would earn at the National Weather Service or in academia The appetite for weather is insatiable says James L Gooding director of meteorology at Duke Energy Corp A former NASA scientist Dr Gooding will be adding a fourth forecaster to his Houston team in the next year Enron Corp an energytrading giant based in Houston has more than doubled its staff of weather forecasters to nine in the past three years plucking talent from places like the Weather Channel Williams Cos a Tulsa Okla competitor is endowing university fellowships to lure meteorology students And since Aquila which is owned by UtiliCorp United Inc of Kansas City Mo has hired two other meteorologists from Mr Hoggatts alma mater the University of Wisconsin plus another scientist with a PhD in climatology That hiring paid off a bit during this weeks winter storm in the Northeast While many on the East Coast were getting miscues from TV weathermen on a pending possibly historic blizzard that fizzled in New York and other cities traders at Aquila simply looked to Mr Hoggatt Last Friday Scott Macrorie an electricity trader for the MidAtlantic region at Aquila stopped by to see how the storm was progressing Mr Hoggatts team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be lower because of the storm though the snowfall forecast on TV seemed a little high Sure enough temperatures fell and snowfall in many cities was less than predicted lifting electricity prices and making Mr Macrorie a profit that he says was in the tens of thousands of dollars About university students in the US graduate each year with bachelors degrees in meteorology according to the American Meteorological Society An additional or so graduate with masters degrees or doctorates Until just a few years ago those graduates didnt typically have many options TV for those who had the blowdried look backoffice jobs with the government or a handful of private consultants for those who didnt Research was an option And some airlines and utilities kept a few meteorologists on staff to help position airplanes or powerline repair trucks during storms Now deeppocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with graduate degrees salaries ranging from to Performance and trading bonuses can double or even triple the figure That compares with the roughly the National Weather Service pays a junior forecaster with a graduate degree Its a bit unusual for meteorologists to have the prospect of lucrative employment after graduation says John NielsenGammon a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas AM University This is a bit of a switch So far there has been no dearth of meteorological talent available partly because the National Weather Service wrapped up a big expansion project in the mids and slowed hiring It hires only to replace people who leave about to meteorologists a year And the highpressure world of billiondollar commodity bets isnt for everyone When Carl Altoe graduated from Penn State one of the nations top meteorology programs he got a heavy sales pitch from Enron Its quite an impressive place he says of Enrons trading floor but he wasnt sure forecasting skills alone would be enough to make the grade I would be afraid that if money wasnt made in a hurry Id be tossed says Mr Altoe who accepted a position with the National Weather Service in Marquette Mich For others having forecasts count puts a new thrill in the old art After two years as a manager at the Weather Channels Latin American division in Atlanta Jose Marquez posted his resume on an Internet job site run by the American Meteorological Society Enron called Have you heard about Enron Mr Marquez remembers being asked And I said honestly No During a visit Mr Marquez a yearold Navytrained meteorologist found Enrons trading floor exhilarating Enron courted Mr Marquez heavily tracking him down three times during his Christmas vacation in Puerto Rico Mr Marquez decided the sprawling trading floor was just the sort of active work place he was looking for Also hed be getting a to boost over his Weather Channel salary before potential bonuses from Enron Im getting more money than I would anywhere else he says Weather has long affected prices of everything from grain at Chicagos early commodity markets to the stocks of retail companies on Wall Street Jon Davis a meteorologist for Salomon Smith Barney in Chicago started forecasting the weather for agriculture traders back in But volatile energy prices have raised the stakes for forecasters who are able to gauge airconditioning use in the summer or naturalgas demand during the winter heating season Meanwhile all sorts of companies are turning to energy traders and Wall Street for weather derivatives complex contracts used to hedge financial risks associated with the weather With every passing year you do more energy and more energy Mr Davis says Despite big advances in data collection and modeling betting millions of dollars on weather forecasts can still be tricky business Shortterm forecasts are pretty good Predicting weather two weeks from now is chancy Most meteorologists get their data from the government particularly the National Weather Service Many then tweak it with their own interpretations or forecasting models Disappointed last year by poor longterm forecasts from private consultants Aquila has a contest offering to the meteorologist or team that can best predict temperatures in major US cities over the course of a year I call it the forecast bakeoff says Mr Hoggatt The high stakes also mean more pressure on forecasters WSI Corp a Billerica Mass weatherforecasting firm started an energy service last year and Jeffrey A Shorter a WSI vice president says energy clients can be less forgiving than his other clients in TV and aviation especially when the forecasts are wrong But he adds presumably more often than not were right End of ISDA Press Report for March THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF ISDAS BOARD OF

strength hampers new exchange issues Risk News BoE Clementi Wants More Transparency In Derivatives Mkts Dow Jones International News By Gonzalo Vina LONDON Dow Jones Bank of England Deputy Governor David Clementi said Friday that booming derivatives markets need to be more transparent to avoid risks to the stability of financial markets According to prepared remarks for a speech to be delivered at a central banking conference at the Bank of Italy in Rome Clementi said the documentation recording transactions in derivatives markets also needs to be improved to avert wider shocks in financial markets In the banking system capital and liquidity management are crucial to the management of these risks and have to be adapted to new circumstances Clementi said But the attention of central banks and regulators cant end there Recent developments in the credit transfer markets and the concerns identified regarding risk management and documentation for credit derivatives illustrate this he added Clementi said one of the benefits of the rapid expansion of credit derivative markets worth around billion a year is that banks need no longer remain exposed to their large customers But these same customers can now take on further exposure to other forms of credit through these new instruments without increasing their borrowing This he argues makes it more difficult for creditors shareholders and regulators to assess risk Clementi warned that the documentation relating to many of these transactions is often misunderstood or is taken to have different meanings by different parties He is also worried about how courts in different countries would treat these contracts Swaps may move warns BIS Financial Products March By Andrea Reierson Consolidation in the global banking sector could make it harder to keep swaps the preserve of the OTC marketplace and may push them onto a centralised exchange the Bank for International Settlements BIS said in its quarterly review Creditconscious customers are losing their ability to diversify counterparty credit risk particularly in their derivatives transactions the BIS said in its report for the fourth quarter of last year This increasing concentration of swap books may spark strong pressure for swaps listed on an organised exchange where counterparty risk is taken by the exchanges clearing house BIS said Later this month Liffe is to roll out futures contracts based on euro swaps which will allow traders to hedge two five and tenyear swap contracts in the same way bond traders use futures to hedge positions BIS also noted the market shift in fixed income benchmarks from government bonds to shorterterm instruments particularly in the US This comes amid the trend of declining government debt issuance and debt buybacks while financing grows among parastatal and private sector financing This would likely see derivatives exchanges introducing contracts based on underlying assets such as corporate bonds and assetbacked securities In a study accompanying the quarterly review the BIS found that private instruments eclipsed government paper as a benchmark in the dollar money market over the last two decades And the bond markets shift away from government securities may have continued even without the declining stock of US government debt issuance Trading in interest rate swaps has risen relative to futures and options trading in Treasury notes and bonds with transactions in couponbearing US Treasuries peaking in while those in private instruments continue to rise the BIS said Global exchangetraded derivatives activity rose in the fourth quarter of last year to trillion buoyed by rising volumes of equity derivatives trade while an increase in moneymarket transactions offset a decline in government bond related trade BIS said in its quarterly review For as a whole the value of exchangetraded products rose from the previous year to tr The value of Interest rate product transactions also grew to tr Weakening stock markets and increased volatility boosted equityrelated trade prompting increased hedging by investors BIS said Expectations of easier monetary policy in the US led to buoyant activity in short term interest rate products with the dollar value of US money market contracts up The continued expansion of the interest rate swaps market also underpinned demand for money

Too Much Caution BNA March Even as he acknowledged that lax credit standards can jeopardize banks solvency and have contributed to deteriorating bank earnings Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan March cautioned bankers not to be overly careful about making loans Lenders and their supervisors should be mindful that in their zeal to make up for past excesses they do not overcompensate and inhibit or cut off the flow of credit to borrowers with credible prospects Greenspan told a convention of the Independent Community Bankers of America in Las Vegas Greenspan said community bank lending has had little to do with recent contractions in loan quality Todays problems generally relate to syndicated credits especially those to leveraged borrowers he said As problems materialized earnings fell significantly for some of the larger banks which in turn caused aggregate commercial bank industry earnings to fall slightly during thus bringing to an end the industrys string of ten consecutive years of higher earnings Nevertheless though the effects of these excesses are likely to continue for much of this year in the form of moderately deteriorating asset quality and earnings at some of the larger banks these problems one hopes will prove modest both by historical standards and relative to the resources of these institutions Greenspan said bank regulators are paying close attention to smaller commercial banks increased real estate lending Though underwriting practices appear to be much healthier today than they were in the s and standards have tightened somewhat recently supervisors are paying particular attention to community banks with concentrations that make them materially vulnerable to a downturn in this market he said Nevertheless Greenspan was also somewhat critical of banks lending judgment It is interesting to note that the length of the current expansion coupled with the absence of problem commercial loans until recently has led to some depreciation in both bankers and supervisors skill in handling weakened or troubled credits he said referring to the problem lending of the late s and early s To community bankers concerned that it has become increasingly difficult to attract the deposits necessary to maintain a healthy lending portfolio Greenspan offered the other side of the coin It is also important to recognize that the reduction in portfolio liquidity is more a product of good businesshigh loan demandthan of the relatively slow growth in core deposits Greenspans comments further confirm earlier indications that he does not support proposals to raise deposit insurance coverage provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation above the current per account provided now Recently FDIC adopted the position that deposit insurance coverage levels should be raised Several bills pending in Congress would raise coverage levels to per account Banks OK With Basel Lastly Greenspan said most banks have submitted comments to the Fed in support of the new Basel Accord which recommends new capital standards for banks Responses to a request for comment related to the new Basel Accord and an alternative proposal by the Fed that could simplify capital standards for US banks show that most banks prefer the Basel Accord he said The responses to date indicate that community banks in general do not believe that the current accord is burdensome mainly because the costs of adapting systems and reporting for such an approach have already been incurred Greenspan said Indeed some commentators indicated that a change to an even simpler system would in itself be more burdensome than sticking with the current regime The Fed the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency the Office of Thrift Supervision and FDIC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on the matter in October Comment letters have indicated cautious support for simpler methods of calculating capital adequacy but not if simplicity means meeting tougher capital criteria Many banks have also reported to the Fed that they are not in favor of a standalone leverage ratio with much less complexity and reporting if it means that bank supervisors would set the a minimum ratio higher than is required by the current leverage standard Greenspan said Many of the responses indicated that was not a favorable tradeoff even though most community banks have exceptionally strong leverage ratios he said I should emphasize that we are still analyzing your many excellent comments to determine what kind of response we should give ISDA seeks derivatives product documentation standard Risk News March By John Ferry Members attending the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA conference in Houston this week reached general agreement that there is a need to standardise derivatives master agreements legally binding counterparty contracts There was much discussion about reconciling the variety of product documents for risk management purposes said Ruth Ainslie senior policy director at ISDA the global trade association that represents overthecounter OTC derivatives market participants The possibility of creating a single master master agreement that covers both physical and financial products was actively discussed with advocates citing such contracts would improve efficiency by simplifying the negotiation process for market operators Doubts were expressed by some participants however regarding the feasibility of developing a master master contract especially concerning administration legal and negotiation difficulties with crossaffiliate master agreements OTC strength hampers new exchange issues Risk News March By Christopher Jeffery The continuing dominance of the overthecounter OTC derivatives marketplace has meant the plethora of new exchangetraded products introduced in the past few years have had only limited success While a number of contracts like year Treasury notes have seen significant trading volumes evidence collated by the Bank for International Settlements BIS suggests that growth has been at the expense of other exchangetraded contracts and not due to an erosion of OTC activity Few of the contracts introduced by established marketplaces in recent years have met with an enthusiastic response and the gains enjoyed by some contracts have largely reflected a reallocation of business away from traditional benchmarks said BIS economist Serge Jeanneau in the international bodys Quarterly Review Jeanneau added that this trend was most acute in the US where net repayments of government debt combined with a shift of issuance to intermediate maturities have affected the liquidity of the Treasury bond contract and led to a near displacement by the year Treasury note Europe however has also witnessed displacement activity A reallocation of activity also took place in Europe in the late s with Eurex capturing business in the longterm segment of the euro yield curve and Liffe achieving dominance in the shortterm area said Janneau in the report Janneau believes the falling number of nongovernment issues in the near future will lead to exchanges introducing contracts based on corporate and assetbacked securities Examples of likely future behaviour include the US Bond Market Associations move last September to develop proposals for a corporate bond futures contract and CBOTs efforts to introduce mortgagebacked contracts Janneau added that he also expects exchanges to look at introducing instruments based on broader fixedincome indexes and not just government or corporate securities in the next few years Many investment banks already offer such services End of ISDA Press Report for March THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR

Federal Reserves decision on US interest rates due later in the day off its perch as chief talking point The price of five year default swaps for Argentina widened out to from at the start of the week traders said The move was even more dramatic at the shorterend of the curve with oneyear credit protection on Argentine debt being quoted at from Credit default swaps the most active part of the credit derivatives market are insurancelike tools that enable investors to juggle exposure to the risk of an issuer defaulting on a debt or loan The resignation of economy minister Ricardo Lopez

of recession with a searing austerity programme aimed at raising investor confidence Domingo Cavallo the architect of Argentinas embattled ten yearold fixed exchange rate regime was named his successor With Cavallo yet to set out his policy programme to cut billion off the Argentine fiscal deficit and tackle the countrys crisis it remained to be seen how the US market would open For

UNEXPECTED RISKS Moodys March New York March In a new special report outlining potential risks in credit default swaps Moodys Investors Service says that if credit events are defined too broadly a credit default swap may pass along the risk of loss following mere credit deterioration instead of the risk of loss following an actual default Investors often assume the risk of a synthetic investment by way of a credit derivative is equivalent to the risk of a cash investment in the same credit However if not structured carefully the synthetic investment can be riskier than the cash investment says Jeffrey Tolk a Moodys analyst and author of the report Understanding the Risks of Credit Default Swaps Among Moodys key sources of concern are the prevailing standard definitions for credit events Under a credit default swap losses to investors are determined synthetically based on credit events occurring in a reference credit Thus investors risk is driven largely by the definition of credit events in the swap The broader the definition the broader the risk according to Moodys SOME STANDARD DEFINITIONS ARE BROAD Moodys report includes a detailed look at the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations ISDA widely referenced credit event definitions In some critical areas ISDAs current definitions are broader than the markets understanding of default and could in some cases increase the risk of loss by triggering payouts for events that are not actually defaults says Tolk An obligation that has been restructured to defer principal payments may not technically be a default if the lender has been properly compensated But ISDA would nonetheless define this as a credit event he says Conversely under ISDAs definition of obligation acceleration a credit default swap investor might suffer a loss although an investor in the underlying cash position would suffer no loss OTHER SOURCES OF RISK VALUATION DISCREPANCY MORAL HAZARD In addition to credit events Tolk cites the risks that arise from the difficulty of valuing defaulted credits to determine the extent of loss to investors under a cashsettled credit default swap Calculated losses may vary based on liquidity market conditions and the identity of the parties supplying bids In analyzing a credit default swap Moodys looks carefully at the methods and procedures for calculating loss given default he says The report also says that investors should be aware of moral hazard the inherent conflict of interest that exists because the sponsoring financial institution determines the timing of a loss event as well as how much loss is imposed on investors The sponsors incentive is to construe credit events as expansively as possible and to calculate losses as generously as possible says Tolk Moodys considers these factors carefully when rating securities supported by credit default swaps Tolk believes that these risks can be addressed by tightening the credit event and loss calculation provisions increasing transparency and providing more objective mechanisms for verifying loss determinations The capital markets have an enormous capacity for absorbing credit risk and this capacity has only been partially tapped by the credit derivatives market In Moodys opinion for capital markets investors to participate fully in the growing credit derivatives market the risks inherent in credit default swaps should be more precisely defined more transparently managed and more readily quantifiable How traders in capacity can make rapid new connections Financial Times March By Alan Stewart Online trading exchanges have been set up in many sectors of commerce and telecommunications is no exception But while some exchanges focus on physical goods such as car components or hospital supplies the telecoms version is dealing with something more intangible bandwidth A number of online exchanges have been set up to trade in bandwidth matching buyers and sellers via bid and offer prices and taking a percentage of the price paid According to research by Arthur Andersen the telecoms market will be transformed by bandwidth trading The bandwidth being traded may take the form of physical circuits linking two cities or the data packets and voice calls sent over them A recent Europewide survey by Andersen revealed a market in flux but one which believed in the inevitability of bandwidth commoditisation Online bandwidth trading exchanges have arrived in response to a need because of a bandwidth glut says Simon Forge principal telecommunications analyst at UK consultancy OSI For some of the latest networks going in people are claiming petabits per second thats a billion megabits per second Exchanges have been set up by Arbinet based in New York BandX London and RateXchange San Francisco see accompanying stories Other exchanges already running or being set up include GlobalTeleExchange GTE in Washington Asia Capacity Exchange ACE in Hong Kong International Telecommunications Clearing Corporation ITCC in Dubai and eSwitch Sydney Buyers and sellers of bandwidth are linked up through interconnecting facilities at the switching hubs of the exchanges RateXchange has nine of these in the US plus three in Europe while ITCC intends to have hubs in London Hong Kong Los Angeles New York and Miami The exchanges stress that these connections mean that bandwidth trades will be able to be carried out in seconds At present it can take up to three months to arrange a trade with most of those arranged not actually taking place at all According to investment bank CIBC World Markets Dollars bn in revenues per cent of the wholesale bandwidth market may be traded by Andersen says the bandwidth market has suffered from a lack of liquidity and price transparency combined with a paucity of offers and bids on the exchanges The company believes however that the presence of big energy companies such as Enron and Williams in bandwidth trading is stimulating the appetite of customers for greater product innovation and pricing Bandwidth is expected to follow a shorter timeline to liquidity than any other current traded commodity Although the detail of the emerging market has still to be defined Andersen expects citypairs that is two named cities connected by fiber optic cable to form the basic product Jon Merriman president and chief executive of RateXchange foresees four market segments becoming involved in bandwidth trading within the next year The first are the energy merchants the second the telecommunications companies as a business line the third the financial houses and the fourth the pure commodity players he says A fifth market segment and this is longer term will be large corporates wholl want to trade and optimise their use of bandwidth says Mr Merriman Itll become a treasury function at some point for large companies Thats at least a year down the road but there is interest right now from some large corporates Andersen points out that energy businesses such as Enron Williams Aquila El Paso TXU and Dynegy have made significant investments in backbone customer and skills development in the last few years Those companies presence has had a considerable influence on the growing bandwidth market Steve Elliott chief executive of Enron Broadband Services EBS Europe says the communications market needs to become much more open and robust and that this will change the supply and demand dynamics Its already moving that way says Mr Elliott who stresses that EBS does not see itself in competition with bandwidth exchanges Exchanges exist in all the markets we participate in and theyre an overlay to the actual market itself he says Were not an exchange nor are we an independent player at the exchange level nor a bulletin board type of facilitator Were a market maker a principal in all transactions that we do with contractual terms and physical delivery obligations EBS is creating pooling points to provide physical interconnectivity between bandwidth trading principals Although EBSs plans for doing business in Europe are still at a fairly early stage the company has set up a pooling point in London to provide bandwidth trading between the US and Europe Further European pooling points are in Amsterdam Brussels Dusseldorf Frankfurt and Paris Enron Online Bandwidthrelated commodities have recently been added to the Enron Online webenabled ecommerce platform where the company posts its prices and carries out commodity trading Enron Online is the largest ecommerce web platform in the world for buying and selling commodities says Mr Elliott Weve transacted a notional value of over Dollars bn since its inception around a year ago The energy companies are all copying Enron which is a very progressive rather fabulous company says Marcus de Ferranti co founder of the BandX He points out that Enron is leveraging its own network into its trading and thereby becoming a kind of telecommunications company in its own right Mr de Ferranti suggests the other energy companies are desperately trying to get into the broadband revolution having seen Enrons share price double on the announcement of broadband Theyre coming along in a frenzy trying to copy it and leverage their own infrastructures by sticking fiber along the top of their gas pipes and sticking cables along their electricity highways he says But how do the telecommunications companies view bandwidth trading exchanges Do they see them as speeding up the commoditisation of bandwidth leading to a deterioration of prices At the most senior level the telecoms companies are attracted by what were providing says Anthony Craig chairman and chief executive of Arbinet As you come down some see it as a threat or even say that were a catalysing force for commoditisation I find that on the verge of ludicrous because bandwidth is commoditising anyway says Mr Craig Anything that commoditises needs a more efficient process to manage the product Were responding to commoditisation As for the future the online bandwidth exchanges may face some of the pressures which have caused problems for other BB businesstobusiness marketplaces US analyst International Data Corporation IDC foresees a challenge for bandwidth trading companies in collecting fees and believes exchanges may suffer payment defaults IDC warns also that profit margins could dwindle as bandwidth costs fall taking margins with them I suspect that bandwidth exchanges will have a relatively limited window of opportunity during which time they will make good money says Ian Beeby UK managing director of US consultancy Wireless Facilities Mr Forge at OSI agrees that some of the exchanges will go out of business However he argues Longterm this is something thats here to stay Watchful eye on energy traders Financial Times March By Anthony Cox After the sharp falls in their shares since last summer telcos worldwide might despair at the threat from US energy traders such as Enron to revolutionise how capacity on carriers networks is bought and sold further depressing the prices operators can charge for bandwidth their staple product In two to three years realtime trades on bandwidth for immediate delivery will be possible These will replace at least to some extent the drawn out negotiations between operators when selling space on their networks to one another But if new trading models will exert downward pressure on bandwidth prices by increasing transparency and ironing out market inefficiencies an environment where bandwidth is traded through purposebuilt exchanges has its benefits to operators In the short term it will provide a more liquid channel for selling spare capacity says Stuart McIntosh vice president of the Bostonbased consultancy Adventis Longer term it may have an impact on how operators manage the roll out of their networks he says Leasing capacity in the short term will become increasingly attractive and operators will opt more and more to buy or rent capacity from their rivals instead of building their own infrastructure Bandwidth trading may also increase volumes for operators by creating new sales avenues Exchanges open up new segments in the market many of which you wouldnt do business with if it was down to personal relationships says Cecilia Herslow carrier manager at Telia UK Further operators could benefit from lower sales costs as the expense of setting up longterm capacity deals between operators is replaced with lower per trade costs at the exchanges says Martin Smillie vice president for marketing wholesale at KPNQwest He notes however that the operator will incur costs to set up and maintain trading capability whether on its own behalf or via third party trading houses Some per cent of carriers expecting a liquid traded bandwidth market to emerge within three years according to research by Arthur Andersen A market for derivatives which could eventually dwarf the primary market will follow close on the heels of a market for physical bandwidth Two types of bandwidth exchanges are emerging those that trade bandwidth capacity on specific routes say London to New York socalled routed capacity and those that trade data and voice minutes usually via internet exchanges such as Arbinet and BandX According to Ciara Ryan a senior manager in Arthur Andersens bandwidth trading team the routed capacity market will be the most significant in terms of revenues for operators due to increased pressure to find new channels to market the capacity they own on these routes Owners of capacity are eager to sell their bandwidth as quickly as possible without destroying margins completely he says noting that bandwidth prices are falling by up to per cent annually on transatlantic and European routes Several routes or city pairs will provide a yardstick for the prices for capacity between other cities Capacity on these other routes will trade at a discount or a premium to those that have become the benchmarks says Mr Ryan Some loss of margins may be an acceptable tradeoff for more efficient markets and possible higher volumes of traffic for operators particularly since bandwidth prices are expected to come down in any case due to capacity oversupply Turn to next page From facing page But bandwidth exchanges impact on pricing could be more significant The whole pricing structure is potentially at risk says Nigel Pitcher director of marketing at UKbased carrier Fibernet If spare capacity is sold on an anonymous basis to an exchange the operators existing list price customers could pick up the same capacity at an exchange at a knockdown price while unknowingly remaining with the provider they had originally he says This could cause bandwidth prices to fall dramatically Downward pressure on the price of capacity would be increased if large users were to curtail existing relationships with their operators altogether buying direct from the bandwidth exchanges This threat is dismissed by telecoms industry players however There is no reason why large telecom users could not lease bandwidth today under most regulatory regimes says Ian Beeby managing director of WFI a wireless telecommunications consultancy Mr Beeby notes that most large corporations have spent the last years trying to outsource their telecom networks and that they are unlikely to change direction now The extent to which operators either embrace the new status quo or reject it may define their success in an environment where longterm bandwidth contracts are being replaced by more immediate trading models Carriers will either take on a very proactive approach or a more defensive strategy says Ms Herslow at Telia If a player does not move fast enough a penalty of ignorance may result in some operators losing the first mover advantage suggest analysts This in turn may result in a loss of competitiveness relative to other players fuelling consolidation among global carriers says Christian Jepsen the founder of Pangea a panEuropean carrier with a focus on Scandinavia Ultimately there may be three to four global carriers and only a handful of regional ones left he says In anticipation of significant changes in the market Pangea is already establishing a separate sales team to focus exclusively on capacity sales via bandwidth exchanges In an increasingly complex market telecommunications operators have no choice but to explore new ways to exchange telecom capacity The sheer number of telecoms players now means that bilateral agreements between carriers will become increasingly obsolete Internationally there are some carriers If they all were all to lease some capacity from one another nearly m interconnects contracts and settlements would be required across the industry Avoiding a proliferation of contracts alone is likely to change the way operators deal with one another on bandwidth deals Although it is too early to see the full implications of bandwidth trading on todays telecoms market operators are keeping the developments under very close review Bandwidth trading may prove to be a interesting idea which simply did not make it but it would be rash to conclude that today says Mr McIntosh at Adventis He also warns that the US energy players could leverage their experience of establishing trading in the energy market to carve a significant niche in the telecoms sector This is borne out by recent developments energy operators Williams and Enron are understood to have joined forces recently with ATT Sprint Global Crossing and Dow Jones to provide the first index for routed bandwidth capacity If I were in a telecoms company I would be watching the energy traders very closely says

Euromoney Accounting changes spell m charge for Sears Financial Times Impatience and optimism on clearing Euromoney Basel gives banks the whip hand Euromoney Interest rate swap market opens up Financial Times March By Janaki Ghatpande Till about to months ago the longterm interest rate swap IRS market was dormant for the lack of sufficient benchmarks despite the Reserve Bank of India RBI permitting the instrument as far back as June Ironically in the last few weeks there has been a spurt in IRS deals indicating a development of the market with increased sophistication in the design of the products While swaps did take place in the past most of them were shortterm swaps for durations between one to three months Indeed swaps of months were the longest available in the market Bankers had earlier cursed the lack of satisfactory benchmarks as holding back the market The problem still remains what is different is the bankers have found innovative ways to price longer term swaps Now the longterm interest swaps have gone up to even five years In an IRS two parties do a swap for a fixed duration wherein an exchange takes place which is mainly notional When bank rates fall a player reverses his position and books his profits Thus they receive a profit when rates actually fall and viceversa One party agrees to pay a fixed interest rate for the tenor of the swap while the other party agrees to pay a floating interest rate This floating interest is usually fixed on a benchmark from the debt markets which could vary from the Mumbai Interbank Overnight Rate Mibor or a synthetic rate derived usually based on a poll of market dealers The hindrance with these swaps is that the benchmarks for them are few and far between While some benchmark is on oneyear interest rate taken from the Reuters page poll of dealers some use the oneyear Tbill average yield against which the fixed rate is determined Therefore the increase in the number of interest rate swaps provides more bench marks than were available initially said a senior dealer with a foreign bank Says Tarun Mehrotri treasurer HSBC As a part of its broader strategy of providing customised and risk management and funding solutions to its clients we provide interest rate swap prices benchmarked on both shortterm rates such as Mibor CP rates and longterm rates such as oneyear TBills government security yields This provides clients the flexibility of choosing the benchmark that best suits their balance sheet needs and addresses their particular assetliability management requirements It is primarily a customerdriven and a customised market which is designed for the corporate keeping in mind their asset liability management point of view It is still not monitored Therefore it is difficult to come up with an estimate about the volumes said an analyst with a foreign bank A swap can be important tools for banks and corporates who want to hedge themselves against conflicting interest rate movements he added In the market place currently the average size of swaps is between Rs crore and Rs crore Even the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India Fimmda is now shifting its monthly curve to a daily curve allowing for more benchmarks The market has a few market makers right now but as the number of benchmarks increase and get validity the market will see more deals in the IRS market said Aashish Pitale vicepresident research JP Morgan Securities India Private Limited Swedish PM not sure of EU financial reform accord Reuters March By Jan Strupczewski STOCKHOLM March Reuters Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said on Thursday he doubted whether reforms to create a single European financial market would be approved at this weeks EU summit in Stockholm The reform is key to meeting the nation blocs selfimposed deadline of integrating its capital markets by to boost the competitiveness of European firms through the same easy cheap access to funding enjoyed by US rivals I am sorry to say I am not confident at all But we will try hard Persson told a news conference on the eve of the summit which will review progress made by the Union towards its goal of becoming the worlds most competitive region by We want to go ahead with it I hope we will be able to gather not only a majority but also unanimity for the reform he said EU finance ministers are due to meet later on Thursday to discuss the reform prepared by a team led by former central banker Alexandre Lamfalussy The Lamfalussy team proposed earlier this month that the EU should adopt a fast tack procedure under which framework laws could be swiftly enacted leaving details to be filled in later by a new European Securities Commission But the proposal has sparked power struggles between the Unions institutions and met with resistance from Germany which fears that its financial centres could be subjected to looser regulation modelled on London Swedish Finance Minister Bosse Rinholm who will chair the Thursday evening meeting devoted to the Lamfalussy proposals said agreement on the reform had reached percent The meeting will start at pm GMT and be followed by a news conference the Swedish EU presidency said COMMITMENT IN DOUBT Failure to back the proposals would cast doubt on the EUs public commitment to an integrated capital market and could further hit the already battered common currency The euros launch in created a European capital market with a common denomination but the market remains divided in many areas by national securities laws and accounting practices Britain Denmark and Sweden have opted to remain outside the euro for the time being The financial plan forms part of a wider agenda laid down by EU leaders last year to make the EU the worlds most competitive place to do business within a decade The March summit is due to review progress towards that goal It is of particular importance that the creation of a common market for risk capital and financial services will be implemented according to the timetables agreed Persson wrote in a column in tabloid Expressen on Thursday The task facing the finance ministers is to stop the issue from snarling up the summit The debate turns on the seemingly arcane point of how a new European Securities Committee would be able to block detailed legislation in areas such as issue prospectuses and insider trading proposed by the European Commission Credit derivatives pose unexpected risks says Moodys head of OTC Risknetcom March By John Ferry Credit deterioration rather than actual credit default could trigger credit default swap contracts under current International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA definitions according to a new report by Moodys Investor Service

triggering payouts for events that are not actually defaults contended Jeffrey Tolk in his report Understanding the Risks in Credit Default Swaps Under a credit default swap losses to investors are determined synthetically based on credit events occurring in a reference credit Thus investors risk is driven largely by the definition of credit events in the swap he added Credit default swaps are bought as a form of insurance against the risk of a bondissuing institution defaulting The report states that a restructuring of debt to defer principle payments may not technically be a default if the lender has been properly compensated although ISDA would define this as a credit event Under ISDAS definition of obligation acceleration a credit default swap investor might suffer a loss although an investor in the underlying cash position would not ISDA which is the leading market association for the derivatives industry has set up a committee to look at credit derivative trading practices in particular credit event definitions Moodys said it is difficult to value defaulted credits to determine the amount of loss to investors under a cashsettled credit default swap Calculated losses may vary based on liquidity market conditions and the identity of the parties supplying bids the report said There is also a moral hazard problem associated with credit default swaps which arises as it is the buyer of protection that determines when a loss event has occurred and how much loss is imposed on the counterparty The buyer has an incentive to be overgenerous in loss calculation and to define a credit event widely Moodys said The expanding credit derivatives market is increasingly gaining the attention of regulators In a speech made two weeks ago David Clementi deputy governor of the Bank of England said he was concerned that market participants may not fully understand the transactions they have entered Watch derivatives warns bank Euromoney March David Clementi deputy governor at the Bank of England says the use of credit derivatives in securitization poses a threat to capital market stability In the closing address to the International Bond Congress in London Clementi surprised borrowers investors and bankers with his concerns at the rapid growth of credit derivatives and ABS markets which many banks hope compensate for the shrinking returns in bond trading and underwriting Clementi said there was a danger of a lack of transparency in the market because of the increase in the use of synthetic CLOs where the risk attached to loans and bonds is sold on without a sale of the assets These markets mean that a bank need no longer remain exposed to its main customers but can rapidly take on large exposures to other credits without any new borrowing by the underlying entities he said Clementi said it was a major challenge for authorities such as the Bank of England or the Federal Reserve to keep pace with the rapidly changing world of securitization and derivatives in collecting financial statistics He also fears not all investors understand securitization Some participants in this market may not fully understand or may have differing understandings of the transactions into which they have entered he said adding that uncertainties remain about how courts in different countries I will treat covenants and agreements in credit derivative deals The case of LTY Steel illustrates his concern LTV is battling Abbey National in the US over ownership of assets securitized in a deal The judge appears to favour LTV though Abbey National says it will appeal if it loses Investors because of this risk have to make sure they have conducted due diligence said Clementi The merging of the lending securities and insurance markets raised new risks he said adding this risk was particularly evident now due to the debate over whether restructuring of debt constitutes a credit event thereby triggering a credit default swap This row was sparked when Conseco restructured its debt late last year The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has convened meetings to try and find agreement on this question The British Banking Association has predicted that the credit derivatives business will triple from billion in to billion in This item first appeared at bonds wwweuromoneycombonds Accounting changes spell m charge for Sears Financial Times March By Christopher Bowe Sears Roebuck Company the second largest US retailer said on Wednesday it plans about m in aftertax charges this year due to accounting rules changes The charges will stem from the retailers adoption of a new Financial Accounting Standards Board rule on companies accounting for use of derivatives and hedging instruments Sears detailed the move in its annual report filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission FASB amended rule No requires that all of a companys derivatives be marked to market valued and recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability Under the rules the fair value of the derivatives which could range from futures contracts to complex swaps transactions may be calculated according to earnings or in other comprehensive income provided certain conditions are met In that case derivatives gains or losses would be measured against the value of the item that is subject of the hedge on the income statement The new accounting rule became effective for all fiscal years starting after June last year Sears said it plans to use the new rule starting in the first quarter this year As a result it expects to take a cumulative m charge this year The transition to the new accounting standard includes recording a m cash flow hedging relationship on the balance sheet and reclassifying deferred losses from terminated interest rate swaps which amount to m Combined they are estimated before taxes at about m The company uses debt and interest rate derivatives and currency hedges to manage its risk Much of Sears profit comes from its credit card arm Sears also said in the filing that it expects about per cent operating income growth and at least per cent earnings per share growth this year Impatience and optimism on clearing Euromoney March By Jonathan Brown London hosted the first worldwide conference of central counterparties last month to discuss developing a system of seamless global clearing The conference was initiated by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation of the US Sir David Walker senior adviser to Morgan Stanley International underscored the importance large securities firms attach to this There is I believe a general recognition that the capacity to clear and settle trades has not kept pace with the capacity of trading platforms to attract liquidity and handle trades he said Without serious thought to improving clearing and settlement the present infrastructure will not be able to cope with large increases in volume and trading Representatives of central counterparties from the US Asia and Europe discussed procedures for operations and risk management the benefits of greater cooperation and legal ramifications All believe there are advantages to be gained from the more effective use of collateral in the systems as well as netting which reduces the amount of settlement that needs to be handled Referring to efforts to integrate regional clearing and settlement systems in Europe Walker said Far greater benefits will accrue if the CCP and netting arrangements of these new vertical structures are designed in an interoperable open architecture way Jill Considine chairman of DTCC was pleased with the progress Weve covered the landscape and gained some very important perspectives on enhancing CCP capabilities including the views of regulators exchanges as well as the views of our colleagues at other central counterparties around the world she remarked And we heard from our customers telling us how impatient they have grown with what they view as slow and piecemeal changes in the industrys infrastructure We must not lose sight of what the customers value most strong risk management low costs and the stability and reliability of a seamless infrastructure Basel gives banks the whip hand Euromoney March By Michael Peterson It has been a long and exhausting labour of love Between zoo and bank regulators from the wealthy G countries have flown many thousands of miles and held countless hours of meetings The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision which meets under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements BIS has spent the best part of two years rewriting the rules on bank capital The committee chaired by New York Federal Reserve president Bill McDonough steered the discussions But the bulk of the work was done by four major subcommittees Each subcommittee set up working groups to look into some detail of the proposed rules The biggest subcommittee the capital task force spawned no less than half a dozen subcommittees of its own The proposal document released on January r is suitably massive Its pages outline a new world order for bank capital which looks at first glance like a vast improvement on the capital accord Where the old agreement sketched out crude guidelines for calculating the amount of capital a bank needs the new proposals delve into the gritty intricacies of collateral haircuts clean break securitization materiality thresholds and granularity scaling factors Given the Herculean efforts of this dedicated band of officials it seems churlish to suggest that the proposals are flawed But serious doubts are emerging about the general direction the committee has taken The central element of the new rules is that big banks will be allowed to set their own capital using internal calculations of risk The regulators expect a good number perhaps to institutions to be doing this soon after the new accord is introduced in But Avinash Persaud State Streets head of global research reckons the trend towards greater reliance on bank risk management systems is a dangerous one It is a dereliction of duty by the regulators he says There is no industry with a longer history of being unable to control its own excesses Flawed accord The need to update the present rules is pressing Simplicity was the great virtue of the capital accord but it was also the big weakness The accord established guidelines for calculating bank capital with a basic minimum requirement of and weighting adjustments reflecting the riskiness of assets Members of the BIS then agreed to introduce these as the basis for national law The rules have quickly become the standard for other regulators too driving up levels of bank capital in many emerging markets for example The present rules apply a series of weights to the basic capital number for different assets on banks balance sheets Supposedly risky assets such as loans to corporates and assetbacked bonds are weighted at Debts to countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD are considered riskfree they are weighted at Exposures to banks based in OECD countries count as low risk assets and are weighted at The bank then has to hold capital equivalent to at least of its riskweighted assets And at least half of that capital has to be in the form of socalled tierone capital chiefly equity and reserves The figure is a minimum National regulators are free to impose higher levels The Federal Reserve for example prefers big US banks to hold capital The accords crude system of asset weightings creates some perverse effects It means banks based in OECD countries can get much cheaper funding than those outside the OECD club This is not necessarily a good thing for countries that join the OECD State Streets Persaud points out that the old Basel system produces regular OECD membership crises After they were admitted to the organization during the course of the s Mexico the Czech Republic Poland and Korea all experienced economic booms fuelled by suddenly cheaper credit A year or so later each boom promptly turned to bust Under the rules a junk bond portfolio with a heavy concentration of telecom names is weighted at Fair enough But a diversified loan book of highquality corporate names is rated at exactly the same level Banks know the Basel weightings produce a distorted picture of their true risk and many have become adept at finding ways to reduce their regulatory capital using tools such as securstization and credit derivatives Others have played the system for all it is worth stocking up on risky but lowweighted assets The old regime had broken down because of the complexity of what the large and sophisticated banks were doing says Oliver Page director of complex groups at the UK Financial Services Authority and a member of the Basel Committee It was leading to capital arbitrage and we could no longer be confident that the resulting capital matched the risks they were actually taking Dynamite in the draft The Basel Committees first thoughts on revising the capital accord were mostly about rejigging the problematic risk weightings A discussion document released in June proposed a series of refinements to the original risk bucket method The number of risk weighting bands would be increased and the OECD link would be scrapped But what better measure of credit risk could be used The committee proposed a controversial solution weighting assets according to their credit ratings from the private sector rating agencies The idea of incorporating credit ratings into the accord created a few misgivings For one thing many borrowers especially in Europe are not rated Some also worried that borrowers would cherrypick the most favourable ratings The agencies themselves were not overjoyed at the proposal They quibbled over what they saw as inconsistent application of their ratings from one asset class to another The proposal didnt stop at refining the weightings It introduced a couple of new ideas One was that banks should be charged for operational risk the risk of things like system failures and rogue traders But the real dynamite came halfway through the page document The committee conceded that a small number of very big sophisticated banks might be allowed to bypass the whole standard weightings process altogether They would be able to set their own capital requirements in consultation with their regulator using their own models of risk Risk modelling has become a growth industry in recent years Big banks argue that they can now model and manage their risk in a highly sophisticated way Their models give them a detailed picture of the risks inherent in their business and the amount of capital they need to set aside for those risks Usually the models say banks need to carry less capital than they would using the standard riskweighting method Between June and the end of as the committees and subcommittees met to thrash out the details of the new system the internalratings based approach grew into the biggest part of the proposals And no longer was it only the very biggest banks that would be allowed to use internal models Now any decentsize bank could aspire to calculating its own capital needs The big change from our June paper is that we have designed an internalratings based approach that a good number of banks should be able to apply says the FSAs Page In June we just talked about applying it to some sophisticated banks But over time we expect a major share of the banking system will be on the internalratings based approach It is not completely clear why the committee decided to apply the internalratings based approach more widely The official line is that a large number of banks have demonstrated their capability in risk modelling But some close observers reckon the committee was under strong pressure from some European authorities particularly the German representatives to allow a lower threshold for the internal models approach The new proposals talk about three approaches to setting capital The simplest the standardized approach is an extension of the present system but with risk buckets now linked to credit ratings A tripleA sovereign carries a risk weighting SingleA sovereigns doubleA corporates and tripleA supranationals are weighted at Most loans with a B in their rating fall into the bracket There are also two new weightings SingleA corporates and tripleB sovereigns fall into a band A few risky assets such as singleB corporates carry a weighting Where a borrower has two ratings the lower rating will be used to prevent cherrypicking The internalratings based approach divides into two different methods foundation and advanced Both approaches allow banks to calculate their own risks In the foundation method the regulator supplies some of the parameters for the model In the grownup version banks get to do all the calculations The internalratings based approach should have several big advantages over the simpler method It should dramatically reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage since the differences between a banks economic capital the capital that reflects its true risks and its regulatory capital will be too small to bother about The internalratings based method also has much steeper charges for the very riskiest assets Under the standardized approach the highest risk weighting is But under the internal models approach an asset could carry a weighting In other words for every dollar at risk the bank would set aside cents of capital assuming it was aiming for riskweighted capital But how can we trust banks to set their own capital The authors of the proposals give two reasons First the regulators will not simply sit back and let the banks do their own thing In fact they will need to step up their efforts to supervise banks recruiting teams of savvy analysts to pore over the banks calculations Second the market will police the system One lengthy section of the proposal known for no particularly good reason as pillar three requires banks to disclose to the market information on their risk exposures riskmanagement strategies and credit risk mitigation techniques We are moving towards a world in which the regulators step back and allow the market to police itself says Mark Intrater London based managing director at consultancy Oliver Wyman If a bank reports its risks and the market doesnt like it that bank will have a hard time getting funding on favourable terms and its stock price will drop The world is not ready for that yet but this is a step towards it Markets will always be able to move faster than any regulations that could be drafted Disclosure or what one analyst in attempt to catch the mood of the moment calls the Big Brother part of the proposals is designed to prevent banks abusing the internalratings based approach If we can get market discipline to work then it wont be the capital regime that drives the amount of capital banks have it will be market pressure says Page We see this already Because of market pressures banks already hold materially more capital than we set as their minimum Using banks internal models to calculate capital may be an attractive solution to the tricky problem of how to regulate large and sophisticated banks But the approach is open to several lines of criticism Some say the banks own models are not all they are cracked up to be Stare Streets Persaud says that banks do need riskmanagement systems but the ones they use today are imperfect These markersensitive riskmanagement systems all have the same philosophical flaw he says They assume that every bank is acting independently they assume that when they sell there is a marker to sell into In other words they understate the real riskiness of panicky illiquid markets The use of banks internal models can be a problem agrees Standard Poors analyst Tanya Azarchs to the extent that everyone starts to use the same kind of models to determine the credit risk of a loan If that model is falsesignalling it could cause real problems when everyone heads for the exits at the same time Whats more greater disclosure might exacerbate the problem of what Persaud calls herding We are going down the wrong path in insisting on more disclosure he says Every crisis follows a boom This tells us that the crisis is not about a lack of information It is not about some domestic ill that the right risk management system could have told us about The cause of the crisis lies somewhere in peoples collective loss of sense during the original boom Persaud believes the right approach to preventing crises is to encourage contrarian investing We need heterogeneity he says We need lots of different types of investors playing lots of different types of markets with lots of different strategies and risk management systems This emphasis on transparency is encouraging more herdlike and less contrarian behaviour This is why markets are becoming ever bigger in terms of turnover but ever thinner in terms of liquidity The proposals may discourage contrarianism in other ways too Use of internal credit models may exacerbate natural economic cycles by encouraging banks to lend heavily in the good times and cut back on credit when the economy turns down depressing ratings For example as the US economy has stalled in recent months bankruptcies have risen and credit ratings have fallen Banks internal credit models presumably show the same decline in asset quality Under the internalratings based approach banks riskweighted assets would now be increasing and their regulatory capital requirement would be going up That would encourage them to freeze new credits In times of rising credit quality the reverse would apply perhaps fuelling a boom Another criticism of the banks internal models is that they are not conservative enough SPs Azarchs thinks banks own capital models award them too much benefit for the diversity of their portfolios Banks internal portfolio models suggest they could run on as little as half the capital they have now she says We dont believe that is the case We dont think there is excess capital in the system If this proposal winds up decapitalizing the system that would be very concerning For now banks would not be entitled to a capital reduction purely on the grounds of credit diversity although this is something that the Federal Reserve has hinted could be introduced later As a result the banks calculations of regulatory capital will still typically come out higher than their calculations of economic capital under the internal models approach Unrealistically short maturities are another problem with banks own models Most banks internal models assume a hold rate of one year or less says Azarchs That is one reason their internal models show a capital surplus She believes the advanced internalratings based approach falls into the same trap of underestimating maturities The foundation version of the internalratings based approach assumes that all loans have a maturity of three years a reasonably cautious assumption But on the advanced approach banks will be able to plug the legal maturity of loans into their capital calculations Azarchs thinks this would be a mistake We dont think this is the right way to think about it she says A loan has nothing to do with its stated term it is representative of a relationship As long as things are going well one expects the loan to be rolled over If the capital models give recognition for short legal maturities banks may simply extend short loans and roll them over Banks would employ the same kind of capital arbitrage they do today when they extend day credit facilities such loans are designed to benefit from the zero risk weighting of undrawn loans with a maturity of less than one year National pride Another worrying aspect of the new modelsbased approach to bank capital is that it will mean different things to different regulators In a way this is no different from the situation with the current capital accord But at least the version has the virtue of being simple enough for the most backward regulator to understand Were not sure that all national regulators are equipped to supervise the internalratings based approach says Azarchs at SP There would probably be an incentive for all of them to vet a few of their largest banks right out of the gate on the assumption that these big sophisticated banks must know what they are doing National pride might also sway some regulators to treat their charges leniently There is still scope for significant discrepancies in the way these proposals are implemented particularly in pillar two supervision says John Tattersall partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in London Very few regulators will want the embarrassment of deciding that their major banks are short of capital So what is to stop a regulator letting a few of its banks graduate to the internalratings based approach even when their risk management systems are nor up to scratch The idea of a completely level playing field is an unreachable goal says Page at the FSA But we will have processes to try to ensure there is a reasonably evenhanded treatment across the G This will not be some kind of central policing It will involve being open about what is going on in each others countries and feeling free to comment Market forces act as another constraint If a supervisor is known to be a soft touch the banks under its supervision will be penalized in the market place Some large banks are privately worried that their own regulators will apply the new rules more harshly than supervisors in other countries The disclosure requirements in the proposal are another big source of concern for some of them The committee seems to have taken a kitchensink approach to disclosure says Tattersall at PricewaterhouseCoopers Everything that might be desirable seems to have been included But Page at the FSA appears to offer some hope that the disclosure requirements will be watered down You need a fair amount of information to make the internalratings based approach work he says The disclosure requirements we have proposed are desirable but we also need to be sure they are cost effective for banks It may be there are better ways of arriving at the same results I certainly hope banks will give us good feedback on this point The Basel accord is only supposed to apply in the Gin countries but some observers have begun to think about the impact of the proposals on the rest of the world Basel was never designed for emergingmarket banks says Ian Linnell an analyst at Fitch in London But in reality it is adopted by any banking system that wants to be taken seriously And the idea that riskier entities should hold more capital is definitely one that should apply to banks in emerging markets He believes the proposals could have some unintended consequences in less developed banking systems ln practice most emerging market regulators will adopt the standardized version with some modifications Others will stick with the current version of the accord something they are perfectly entitled to do We will end up with four different methodologies for calculating bank capital the version of Basel the standardized approach the foundation internalratings based approach and the advanced internalratings based approach says Linnell Add the salt and pepper of charges for things like operational risk and you have a recipe for confusion The whole concept of a minimum level of tierone capital could become relatively meaningless Time to collect data One key uncertainty in all this is how many banks will use each of the three new ways of calculating capital The consensus at the moment is that a minority of banks but a majority of banking assets will quickly move to using internal models My sense is that in about banks around the world will adopt the foundation approach immediately and that maybe two or three will go straight for the advanced approach says Azarchs at SP Within half a decade the best part of too institutions could be setting their own capital That means banks need to start crunching a lot more data The timing is tight says Tattersall at PricewaterhouseCoopers Banks need to start collecting the data next year in order to have the necessary three years of historical data by In order to use the foundation version of the internalratings approach banks need to input reliable data for every assets probability of default If they want to graduate to advanced they should also be able to make assumptions about loss severity or recovery rates The internalratings based approach looks great in theory says Linnell at Fitch But there is a real problem with the quality of data Banks may have a reasonably good handle on probability of default but it is very hard to get hold of data on recovery rates Up until now banks have been surprisingly poor at keeping consistent records on how many of their borrowers have defaulted and how much of a hit they took as a result Even the most rigorous institutions are hazy about some areas of their business Most big sophisticated banks have rating systems for some loans that would pass regulatory muster says Intrater at Oliver Wyman But they also have categories of special loans that are managed in a less sophisticated manner It is simply the difference between using a system for internal management purposes and using it for external reporting purposes Clearly banks will need to improve their record keeping It has been widely suggested that this scramble to put new systems in place will increase the pace of banking consolidation Smaller banks it is assumed will not be able to make the necessary investment in technology On the other hand bank mergers have often made it more difficult to get systems in place According to Azarchs at SP Canadian banks have some of the best historical data in the world This is because Canadian institutions have been prevented from merging US banks by contrast often find it difficult to reconcile data from a number of legacy systems One widespread assumption so far has been that smaller banks will ignore the internalratings based methods and stick with the standardized approach A lot of small specialist retail operations will quite appropriately ignore everything beyond the standardized approach says Intrater But the internal models approach could yet gain a momentum of its own If internal models are successfully used by as many as o or o banks to reduce their capital requirements smaller banks may want to join the party too This will certainly be the case if the technology and expertise needed to use the approach become relatively cheap commodities Perhaps one or two banks might develop a certain way of doing internalratings based measurement and start to franchise that procedure out to smaller banks suggests Raj Malhotra credit analyst at Goldman Sachs in London Smaller banks might be willing to pay for that Just as the original Basel accord was soon adopted much more widely than it was originally intended so the internalratings based approach could become the standard for any bank which aspires to international respectability Once the floodgates of internal capital calculation have been opened they may not be easily closed Power to the regulator If that happens a lot of regulators will need to learn a whole new set of skills There are broadly two approaches to bank regulation The first involves laying down the rules and checking that banks comply with them The second often called bank supervision is more intensive it involves making individual judgements about each banks risks and appropriate levels of capital and continually checking that banks are playing it safe The FSA is proud of its record in bank supervision In the UK we have recognized for a long time that there is no way to collect all the information you need put it through some number cruncher and come out with an answer for the amount of capital a bank needs says Page There are areas where judgement is required in forming the answer The Basel Committee proposals have quite a lot to say about banking supervision or in Baselspeak pillar two The proposal exhorts regulators to review banks internal capital adequacy assessments and to intervene early to stop a banks capital falling below the level appropriate to that banks risk characteristics But this level of supervision will be much harder for some regulators to put in practice than others And it is not simply that some regulators are smart and others are dullards Regulators such as the Federal Reserve have the advantage of a relatively small number of large banks to manage says Intrater at Oliver Wyman Others such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which regulates smaller US institutions supervise a large number of small banks They will need a much larger staff of supervisors Some observers have the feeling that the more cluedup regulators notably the Federal Reserve and the FSA are getting too far ahead of their less sophisticated colleagues A lot of national regulators lack the powers to go in and do this kind of pillartwo supervisory control says Azarchs at SP In addition they may not have the experience or the staff to do it Is it realistic to expect all regulators to supervise their banks in the way set out in the proposals Not all supervisors will suddenly set differentiated requirements for all banks says Page at the FSA But I would expect that they will look at some of the bigger ones and at some of the outliers But the Basel Committee cant force countries to invest in creating powerful and expert regulators even though this is exactly what the internalratings based approach requires These proposals appear to give greater powers to the market but in some ways they do the opposite says Linnell at Fitch Regulators will need to set key data inputs and supervise the entire internalratings based approach That will increase the burden on regulators Many are not going to have the people or expertise to cope The big uncertainty of the Basel proposals lies with the capabilities of the worlds bank regulators Much of the epic work they have written makes good sense But when the new accord is implemented in the real world it will like the accord before it take on a life of its own Administrator for Policy Media Relations ISDA Fifth Avenue Rockefeller Center th floor New York NY Phone Fax Email Ivygif

Sparks Speculation The Wall Street Journal Europe The inevitability of consolidation Euromoney Long after LTCM hedge funds still pose concerns Reuters EUs single financial market in the balance Financial Times March By Christopher BrownHumes Peter Norman Rapid development of the European Unions planned single market for financial services last night hung on just a few words of text in a draft resolution to be put to EU leaders at their summit in Stockholm which starts today The resolution which would give a big political boost to the recent proposals of Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy to speed secondary legislation on financial services through the EUs decision making machinery met continuing German opposition as finance ministers gathered in a special session of the EUs Ecofin council to try to resolve the issue Before the talks Bosse Ringholm Swedish finance minister and chairman of last nights meeting told the Swedish newspaper Finanstidningen We agree on per cent But Goran Persson the Swedish leader and summit host was more cautious Im not confident at all I will try and try hard he told the press The dispute yesterday provided an inauspicious backdrop to the twoday summit which has been called to inject new life into the EUs ambitious yearold project to turn Europe into the worlds most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy by EU member states the European Commission and the European parliament all acknowledge that rapid development of an integrated EU market for financial services would spur economic growth and employment in the EU Amid widespread concern that national political priorities are causing the EU to fall behind with other important reforms such as the creation of an EUwide patent and the liberalisation of its energy and postal markets Mr Persson yesterday stressed the responsibility of the leaders to make the summit a success We are meeting at a time when the economic business cycle is slowing down and that might have an impact on Europe Our talks on structural reform are more important than ever he said Germanys objections to the draft resolution on the Lamfalussy report surfaced late on Wednesday after EU ambassadors in Brussels came close to agreement on unblocking a dispute in which the Commission and member states were deadlocked over how to share powers with a new EU securities committee The immediate problems concerned differences over the ability of the Commission to adopt technical securities market legislation to be put forward by the securities committee proposed by Mr Lamfalussy against the wishes of some member states As the other states found they could accept compromise proposals to settle the dispute it emerged that Germanys more pressing concern was to protect the interests of Frankfurt as a financial centre against a perceived AngloSaxon bias in the Commission department responsible for financial services Last nights special meeting of the Ecofin council was confirmed after Hans Eichel the German finance minister said the issues needed further deliberation BIS Survey Sparks Speculation The Wall Street Journal Europe March By John Hardy NEW YORK No one doubts the foreignexchange market is the worlds biggest financial market but whether daily turnover remains at trillion trillion euros is the subject of much debate among the markets professionals After a long stretch of steady increases daily turnover may register a decline when the Bank For International Settlements releases results of its latest survey in a few months Every three years the Switzerlandbased BIS carries out a comprehensive survey of worldwide activity in foreignexchange and derivatives markets Data collected this year probably wont be fully available until May However industry participants are debating what the latest results will show Many expect them to be very different from those in the last report in That survey indicated that the foreignexchange market generated daily turnover of about trillion This represented in dollar terms growth of in the three years after the previous survey in April Growth was slowing compared with the increase in the period but was still very robust Now the picture is expected to be far less vigorous Some experts believe the next set of results will show a sharp decline in daily volumes Economists at Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs predict the data will show trading has fallen by as much as to around trillion a day Others see a more muted decline Its not anything that you predict with any certainty but I think itll be down a little bit said David Gilmore a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex Connecticut The inevitability of consolidation Euromoney March By Jonathan Brown It took a while for the internet to have any significant impact on wholesale financial markets While the rest of the global economy was busy diving into the dot corn pool the largest financial institutions especially their fixedincome departments were cooling their heels not wanting to commit themselves too early to the socalled new economy But last year the leading bond market firms finally dived in All the big players have stakes in a wide variety of platforms seeking to ensure a presence as the winners and losers sort themselves Out In the fixedincome markets dozens of platforms have been launched in the past year all promising to provide buyside institutions and issuers with the benefits that electronic trading can bring Its becoming clear that not all will be able to survive in what is a highly competitive arena Broadly the main platforms can be split into two groups multipledealer sites aimed at providing buyers with a range of prices usually in a limited array of products and singledealer multiproduct sites where one dealer offers access to many categories of instruments but with no price comparison An example of the latter is Credit Suisse First Bostons platform Prime Trade Ben Cohen head of fixedincome ecommerce at CSFB feels that the singledealer model has a future but must offer an even greater variety of products in order to have any chance of survival As for the multidealer sites Cohen believes that there is room for several platforms with a maximum of two or three in each category CSFB has taken a position in most of the main ventures in the multidealer field to ensure that the bank will have a say in shaping the market Carry Jones director of sales and marketing at BrokerTec believes that the market will eventually be able to sustain only a few platforms in each area The likely winners will need market sponsorship low costs excellent technology and a broad product range he says BrokerTec meets all of these criteria we started by dealing in governments as these are the most liquid products quickly added basis and repo trading and will soon be expanding into such areas as agencies Pfandbrief and corporates We want to be seen as a system that covers all fixedincome products not just government bonds As these systems multiply and develop traders will want to minimize the number of platforms they have to deal with so the multidealer multiproduct model would appear to be the likely winner Lee Olesky President and CEO of BrokerTec says Traders dont want to have to go to five or six different places to access liquidity Multidealer sites must merge The market is poised to enter a new stage of development when multidealer singleproduct sites will come together For the moment the array of online platforms is bewildering Confusion is apparent among the large banks that have backed many of them as to which they are likely to support Some fixed income heads seem unsure about what investments their firms have made They got involved in the first place because online trading offers great savings in time and costs Whereas previously a trader or investor wishing to buy a particular type of bond would have to spend valuable time on the phone to various dealers searching for the best price now the most advanced platforms offer the facility to compare prices from a group of dealers in a matter of seconds Although individual savings may not seem that much as volumes increase still further the cumulative effect could become substantial To offer the best possible system to users a platform must also have the best technology Cohen says To be successful a platform must offer quick updates of prices reliability and security The platform must always be evolving In order to achieve this a provider must have an efficient technology team Bankbacked platforms generally fit into two categories those that outsource their technology requirements and those such as CSFB that develop inhouse teams to coordinate technological management of the site But there is another class typified by Prescient Markets shortterm debt newissue platform cpmarketcom Prescients management comes from a software background and the team was set up

prominent contenders Long after LTCM hedge funds still pose concerns Reuters March BASEL Switzerland March Reuters Top international regulators said this week that more work is needed on reducing risks posed by highlyleveraged institutions like hedge funds A working group of top regulators warned in a study released on Thursday against backsliding on efforts aimed at preventing another nearfailure like the one involving US hedge fund LongTerm Capital Management in The LTCM rescue involved over banks which injected about billion to keep the Connecticut firm from going under Fears that problems could spread through the system prompted the New York Federal Reserve to oversee the private sector rescue New York Fed President William McDonough welcomed the latest report by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions which looks at progress made since these bodies published earlier reports on the same topic in Rather than leaving issues in the air they thought it would be a good thing to have an assessment of the progress made said one source familiar with the report The latest report said banks and securities firms have improved due diligence and monitoring of highlyleveraged institutions HLIs Meanwhile leverage overall has decreased and with the unwinding and restructuring of some big highlyleveraged firms concentration risk has also gone down The latest report cites a need for more work on getting information from leveraged firms These are not always forthcoming partly for fear of competition LTCM for example was regarded by investors as an organisation giving out sparse information on its activities An important aspect of the relationship between HLIs and authorised firms is the timely flow of relevant information between counterparties and the appropriate management of the exposure in light of this information a report summary said This is the area where you need a clear dialogue the source added saying it would be especially useful to glean more information on measures like ValueatRisk VaR which estimates the maximum theoretical potential loss to a trading book over a given time span Another area for work is seen in collecting margins on derivatives positions While margins are common on exchangetraded instruments they are less so in the overthecounter markets Here the report said competition was also a problem While firms have generally been able to strengthen contractual provisions with respect to the HLI sector competitive pressures continue to affect firms ability to insist on the full range of risk mitigants including initial margin the summary said End of ISDA Press Report for March THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA

deliver Financial Times Merchant Banking Capital Proposal Draws a Chorus of Industry Criticism BNA Euro swap spreads seen sideways US to narrow Reuters Feds Greenspans speech to Bond Market Assn Reuters Enron Offers Structured Weather Note Derivatives Week Liquidity The ISDA Master Agreement Derivatives Week April Ensuring liquidity should be the primary goal in negotiating an ISDA Master Agreement the Agreement for smaller nonrated customers such as a hedge fund or a middlemarket corporation Often highly leveraged and with little room for error these customers should focus their efforts when negotiating the Agreement with a dealer on limiting the dealers opportunity to terminate the Agreement Unfortunately however customers typically through expensive outside counsel often instead use up valuable negotiating capital on esoteric legal issues that may only remotely affect a customers situation A dealer typically wants the right to terminate the Agreement at the first sign of its customers economic difficulties such as a cross default or a decline in the customers net worth Because of the fluctuating nature of derivatives a dealer wants to quickly terminate any growing exposure from outstanding transactions as its customers credit deteriorates Early termination of its Agreement with the dealer however may only further a customers growing liquidity crisis Upon early termination a customer that is outofthemoney on its trades with the dealer may end up having to make large termination payments Depending on its agreements with other dealers an early termination could possibly give other dealers the right to terminate their agreements with the customer Even if the customer is in the money it may not be able to replace important terminated hedging transactions Termination of the Agreement may be the beginning of the end for a customer in economic difficulty Cross Default One of the most important signs of a customers financial deterioration for a dealer is the occurrence of a cross default by the customer with one of its other creditors Under the Agreement a cross default takes place upon the occurrence or existence of an event of default with respect to specified indebtedness For the provision to apply however the parties must affirmatively elect for the cross default provision to apply to either or both parties The parties must also agree on the definition of specified indebtedness Specified indebtedness is defined in the Agreement to be any obligation whether present or future contingent or otherwise as principal or surety or otherwise in respect of borrowed money Dealers often will want to expand the definition beyond the concept of borrowed money to include obligations under other types of financial transactions such as forwards repurchase agreements securities lending agreements or even exchange derivatives such as futures and options Dealers may even try to define it to include any contractual obligations of the customer The broader the definition of specified indebtedness the more likely that a cross default will occur to the customer In addition many of the new types of obligations added to the definition of specified indebtedness such as repos are prone to technical defaults Although these technical defaults are generally cured or waived in the ordinary course of business they could provide an aggressive dealer with an opportunity to terminate the Agreement upon their occurrence The parties must also agree on appropriate cross default thresholds This is the amount that a default must exceed before it will constitute a cross default Although the dealer will want a threshold of of its equity for itself it will insist on a more modest number for the customer ranging from million The smaller the threshold the more likely that a cross default will occur to the customer In addition as with all cross default provisions the customer should be careful that the agreed upon threshold amount not be lower than its cross default threshold in its other finance agreements For example if the threshold were lower in the Agreement than the threshold under its loan agreement a small payment default on specified indebtedness might trigger the cross default under the Agreement which in turn might inadvertently trigger the cross default under its other finance agreements A customer should insist that a cross default only occur upon the cross acceleration of the other indebtedness as opposed to merely the existence of a default Under the standard cross default language in the Agreement an event of default can occur upon a default under other indebtedness irrespective of whether the other creditor accelerates the specified indebtedness By requiring that the default result in an acceleration of the underlying indebtedness a dealer would not be able to terminate the Agreement until the other creditor actually accelerated the specified indebtedness Dealers generally resist a cross acceleration requirement because it limits their ability to concurrently negotiate with its customer during any workout discussions the customer might be having with another lender For example a creditor could persuade the customer to pledge additional collateral in exchange for not accelerating the indebtedness If the dealer could not declare a cross default under the Agreement at that same time it would not be able to negotiate the same terms with the customer as did the other customers creditors Credit Event Upon Merger A credit event upon merger is a termination event under the Agreement It occurs if a party participates in a merger or enters into a similar type of transaction and the resulting entity is materially weaker after the event The rationale for the provision is that a party may not have entered into the Agreement with the customer that is now materially weaker because of a merger Like the cross default the parties must elect for the credit event upon merger to apply Unfortunately the term materially weaker is not defined in the Agreement The dealer may attempt to define an objective test that would measure when the resulting entity becomes materially weaker For example the resulting entity would be considered materially weaker if its credit rating were materially affected or if it failed designated financial covenants The parties may also want to expand what is meant by a credit event upon merger The dealer may suggest that recapitalizations through the issuance of new forms of stock or debt would constitute a credit event upon merger A customer may want to resist such a definitional change because of the potential restrictions it could pose on its ability to change its capital structure The occurrence of such a change in its capitalization however would still require the resulting entity to be materially weaker to constitute a termination event Additional Termination Events A dealer may insist on adding additional termination events Additional termination events are generally treated under the Agreement similar to events of default If an additional termination event has occurred with respect to a party that party is referred to as the affected party Upon the occurrence of such an event the dealer would have the right to terminate the Agreement at a time precisely when the customer most needs to maintain its liquidity The most common additional termination events negotiated are those that result from a change in the financial condition of the affected party This could be triggered by a credit downgrading or by the failure to maintain a certain level of capital or net worth or a failure to maintain certain financial ratios An additional termination event could also result from a problem unique to the counterparty such as the failure of an Affected Party to maintain a certain legal or regulatory status Failure to notify the nonaffected party of certain events or to deliver certain information could also be an additional termination event Finally if the affected party is dependant on the leadership or direction of certain individuals the resignation or death of such individuals could also result in early termination Son of First Method Designating first method as a method for determining damages upon the termination of the Agreement has become obsolete The effect of first method was to deprive the defaulting party of any payments upon the termination of the Agreement in the event that the defaulting party was in the money Now however dealers are often insisting on the right to delay making payments to a customer upon an early termination of the Agreement until the dealer is completely satisfied that the defaulting party has no further payment obligations to it something that could takes days or even weeks to resolve Delaying payments on an early termination date however can result in significant liquidity problems for a customer Upon an early termination of the Agreement if the customer is in the money it is probable that a customer may be counting on the dealers payment in order to meet any obligations it has on the early termination date to other parties If such payments were withheld by the dealer the customer would be unable to use such amounts to meet its obligations with other counterparties perhaps triggering additional defaults under other agreements for the customer Limiting Cure Periods The Agreement was drafted by ISDA with cure periods much more liberal than may be typically seen in other finance contracts due to what drafters viewed as the unique characteristics of the OTC derivatives market Dealers however have begun to limit these cure periods For example instead of permitting a customer three business days to cure a payment default the dealers are narrowing it to one Similarly dealers are requesting only a fiveday cure period for breach of certain other provisions while the agreement normally provides for Narrowing of such cure periods may not be in a customers best interest These more limited cure periods are probably not sufficiently long for a customer experiencing economic difficulties to resolve the underlying defaults Although there are numerous legal issues affecting the ISDA Master Agreement that are negotiated the most probable issues that may affect a smaller customer deal with terminating the agreement upon the occurrence of some financial difficulty Because of that the customer should focus its efforts on limiting as much as possible these early termination opportunities Deregulation fails to deliver Financial Times April By Geoff Dyer The lights are not blazing at the presidential palace in the Brasilia nighttime as they once did It is not because the staff are taking it easy however The economy measure is aimed simply at saving energy This is more than just a symbolic gesture Since the beginning of April all government offices from that of the lowest bureaucrat to huge those in stateowned corporations have been under orders to cut energy consumption by per cent Private sector companies and ordinary households are also being urged to trim their energy usage before the lights go out involuntarily The saving measures are Brazils lastditch attempt to stave off a fullblown energy crisis and has prompted many comparisons with the partial deregulation disaster in California Yet even with these cutbacks ministers have already admitted that Brazil will need some form of energy rationing later in the year to avoid the risk of serious blackouts The official culprit for the energy shortage is the weather Patchy rainfall has left the reservoirs in the industrialised southeast of the country only a third full when they should normally be at half their capacity at this time of year Given that more than per cent of Brazils energy comes from hydroelectric plants this presents a serious problem Behind the unreliable weather however lies a generation of underinvestment The debt crisis in the early s cut off foreign financing for the sector while the fiscal problems that came with rampant inflation in the late s and early s constrained the states ability to invest Liberalisation and privatisation during the past six years have not resolved the problem In the period to according to the National Development Bank BNDES growth in generating capacity was per cent a year while electricity consumption expanded annually by per cent Like California the deregulation of the Brazilian energy sector has been a halfway house that has pleased neither supporters or critics While most of the electricity distribution companies have been sold off to the likes of AES of the US and Spains Endesa the bulk of generation capacity where most of the new investment is needed remains in public hands Political disputes have led to the persistent postponement of plans to sell Furnas in the southeast and Chesf in the northeast Meanwhile the governments fiscal austerity drive agreed with and painstakingly monitored by the International Monetary Fund has tied its hands from making the necessary new investments The regulatory environment has also been heavily criticised The government had been hoping to encourage a boom in gaspowered plants especially using the BoliviaBrazil gas pipeline which was opened in However the new thermal plants have come on stream more slowly than expected partly because wouldbe investors were worried about having to pay for the gas in dollars while their revenues would be in reals Neither has the government induced the investments in transmission networks that might have alleviated the situation The south of the country has actually experienced normal rainfall this year However as Sandra Boente an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney noted in a recent report Unfortunately there is not enough transmission capacity to shift that excess power supply to the consumption centres in the southeast At least businesses cannot claim to have been surprised by the potential energy crisis Industry groups have been warning their members for several years not to believe government pledges that there would be no rationing As a result a some companies have invested heavily to create their own generation facilities Ambev the largest brewer in Latin America is spending RDollars m on different gasfired power plants at its factories with a total capacity of MW which it hopes to have in operation by the end of next year The plants will cover twothirds of its energy needs and also save up to per cent on its production costs Another government tactic has been to lean on Petrobras the stateowned oil and gas giant to take part in more thermoelectric plant projects The company has been authorised to invest in a further two plants with capacity of more than MW which takes the total number of plants in which it is involved to Yet it is Petrobras which has also contributed to the growing sense of unease about both the countrys energy sector and the governments liberalisation policies The sinking of the worlds largest offshore oil production platform off the coast of Rio de Janeiro in March was a huge blow to national selfesteem President Fernando Henrique Cardoso described the event as our Challenger in a reference to the explosion of the US space shuttle The accident followed a string of environmental disasters at Petrobras operations including a massive oil spill in Rios Guanabara Bay which endangered some of the citys beaches And while the oil rig was staffed by employees of the company many of the accidents have occurred at facilities where the operations have been outsourced to thirdparty companies In the public eye at least the result has been to tarnish the deregulation of the sector which has seen Petrobras lose its monopoly on exploration and production of oil and a new management team try to make the company more transparent and efficient The newlook Petrobras has been winning supporters among the financial community however with record profits last year of RDollars bn the largest ever by a Brazilian company These stemmed not just from the high oil price but also from streamlined operations and increased production Merchant Banking Capital Proposal Draws a Chorus of Industry Criticism BNA April By Richard Cowden After opposing a March proposal to impose percent capital charges on merchant banking activities several banking organizations now are making the case that such charges are unnecessary altogether according to comment letters on a new proposal The Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Jan jointly issued the proposal to establish a rule governing capital requirements for merchant banking activities approved by the GrammLeachBliley Act Under the agencies proposed sliding scale a financial holding company making equity investments in nonfinancial companies that account for less than percent of its Tier I capital would be subject to an percent capital charge on such investment Certain exceptions would include investments made through a small business investment company An FHC investing between and percent of its Tier capital in nonfinancial companies would be subject to a percent capital charge and an FHC making such investments accounting for more than percent of its Tier capital would be assessed a percent capital charge DER A Signaling their low expectations that they can fend off a sliding scale of capital requirements in the proposal many respondents addressed their remarks to limiting the eventual rules impact on existing investment banking activities The proposal asked for comments on whether certain kinds of investments made prior to the March the date of the original proposal should be exempted from the rule Writing for the Securities Industry Association James E Reilly chairman of its holding company committee said his organization continues to believe that the Agencies should allow firms to rely fully on internal capital allocation models to control the risks of nonfinancial investment activities In the SIAs view regulators concerns about the reliability of such models can be addressed through supervision and examination as is currently done in connection with capital allocation for market risk Richard Whiting executive director and general counsel of the Financial Services Roundtable echoed that theme In his comment letter he wrote that the January proposal presents an unnecessarily burdensome array of restrictions that are neither mandated by safety and soundness nor in keeping with the language or spirit of the GrammLeachBliley Act Whiting emphasized that the proposed capital requirement was not contemplated by lawmakers when they enacted the GLB Act The Roundtable believes that more than any other provision of the GLB Act the merchant banking restrictions in both proposed and final rules have impeded nonbank firms from becoming FHCs financial holding companies Whiting said In evaluating the merchant banking rules it is important to note that neither the traditional securities industry nor the venture capital and private equity investment industries seem to have overcome their aversion to FHC status under the GLB Act That comment reflected the sentiments of many in the financial services sector that the capital rules will undercut the benefit of winning permission for depository institutions to participate in merchant banking one of the centerpiece provisions of the GLB Act Beth Climo executive director of the American Bankers Association Securities Association wrote in a comment letter that her group remains concerned that any special capital charge assessed against FHCs engaged in merchant banking activities will further exacerbate the inequities between FHCs and nonFHCs engaged in merchant banking activities Federal regulators have acknowledged the industrys concerns in this regard In his April testimony before two subcommittees of the House Committee on Financial Services Federal Reserve Governor Laurence H Meyer said the proposed capital requirements would be a bridge to an eventual approach that would use the FHCs internal models Reilly wrote SIA recommends that if the Agencies determine to adopt their capital proposal the final rule should contain a sunset provision or at minimum a specific date by which the Agencies will formally reexamine and reevaluate the need for the capital haircuts Exemptions for SBICs The capital proposal would exempt FHC investments in Small Business Investment Companies up to percent of Tier capital SBICs are licensed and regulated by the Small Business Administration and provide equity financing longterm credit and technical support to small companies Despite this special exception the proposed rule would include investments in an SBIC toward the overall amount that would be considered in determining the capital charge level to which the FHC would be subject Groups representing both large and small financial institutions criticized this provision Charlotte M Bahin director of regulatory affairs and senior regulatory counsel for Americas Community Bankers wrote Imposing higher capital charges on such investment activities by banking organizations may well have a negative impact on this important source of capital Whiting wrote If it is concluded that no special capital charge is appropriate for SBIC investments we see no reason to conclude that a nonSBIC investment should have a higher capital charge because there is a certain level of SBIC investments Many commenters also voiced concerns that under the proposal a series of other kinds of equity investments that had been authorized before passage of the GLB Act also would count toward the total used in determining whether an FHC exceeded the percent or percent thresholds Those investment types would include noncontrolling equity investments made under sections c and c of the Bank Holding Company Act portfolio equity investments made under Regulation K and most equity investments by statechartered banks under section of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act Grandfathered The proposal would make existing permissible investments such as those in SBICs subject to the capital charge rule as of March the date of publication of the original proposed rule That provision also drew strong criticism Reilly wrote Imposing a capital charge on these investments without any evidence that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk would penalize institutions for engaging in long permissible activities SIA respectfully submits that imposing a capital charge retroactively is akin to altering the rules in the middle of the game and doing so could have adverse consequences Reilly also suggested that such investments should be grandfathered not only from the March date but from the date on which the agencies issue the final capital rule Mixed Activities Whiting addressed a feature of the proposal that he said could result in inequities for FHCs that invest in companies whose operations involve a mixture of activities In some cases the firm in which the investment is made may engage in activities that are clearly permissible under the Bank Holding Company Act because they are incidental and complementary to financial activities while there may be questions about the permissibility of other activities he said Under the proposed rules if an FHC invested in such a company Whiting wrote it would have to do so under its merchant banking authority and might have to wait for the Federal Reserve Board to rule on the permissibility question Read literally he wrote the special capital charge would apply to the entire investment in a company even if its financial and incidental activities represented percent of its total revenues and assets We believe that such a result is illogical and inequitable Whiting suggested this matter could be dealt with by applying the capital charge only to the amount of the investment that equals the portion of the companys revenues that are not attributable to permissible activities Euro swap spreads seen sideways US to narrow Reuters April By Nigel Stephenson LONDON April Reuters Swap spreads have tightened markedly in recent weeks as rate cut expectations have seen bond yield curves steepen but analysts say that while dollar spreads could narrow further euros could steady or even widen The year US dollar swap spread has narrowed since the beginning of the year when the Federal Reserve embarked on a series of aggressive interest rate cuts to basis points on Monday from on December Swap spreads are going to come in the US because we still have a very aggressive rate cut priced in said Meyrick Chapman derivatives analyst at UBS Warburg Eurozone swap spreads also narrowed in January but then moved out and sideways until late March The year euro spread narrowed to basis points on Friday close to oneyear lows from on March It stood at on Monday In Europe the expectation of cuts has brought in swap spreads but we are not getting any rate cuts right now and that is one of the reasons we might move sideways Chapman said His target was for the year dollar swap spread to hit basis points in six months The year euro swap spread would narrow to just or Swap spreads the difference between the swap rate and the government bond yield at any maturity are gaining importance as a measure of bond performance and of risk appetite A prime driver of the dollar swap spread has been the rapid steepening of the yield curve The year Treasury spread has steepened to more than basis points from at the beginning of this year Chapman said the year spread could widen to having a further positive impact on swap spreads Jim Reid credit strategist at Barclays Capital also said dollar swap spreads could narrow further to the low to mids over three months SPREADS HELD BACK BY EMERGIBG MARKETS EQUITIES He said that while they were driven inwards by rate cuts they had been held back by concern over emerging markets and equities which often see credit underperform If there is any stability in equity markets and any emerging markets positive news flow you are going to get swap spreads performing in dollars He saw the year euro swap spread moving out to or basis points over three months With any lowering of interest rates in the euro zone expected to be modest in comparison with the easing seen in the US analysts said European Central Bank cuts would not have a major impact on swap spreads It is already pricing in probably a more aggressive rate cut than you could possibly see for the next three months Reid said The risk reward is definitely for euro swap spreads to widen from here he added Jose Sarafana strategist at WestLB in Duesseldorf said that after the recent significant narrowing eurozone swap spreads could be ready for a correction He recommended last week that investors consider switching into German government bonds from peripheral eurozone bonds which would underperform as swap spreads widened However longerterm fundamentals supported a further narrowing of spreads He saw the year at by yearend The economy is slowing governments have to issue more debt than expected and this should increase the supply So we should see some underperformance of government bonds versus credits Further steepening of the US bond yield curve should see the year dollar swap spread at basis points by yearend Sarafana said Feds Greenspans speech to Bond Market Assn Reuters April WASHINGTON April Reuters The following is a the full text of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspans speech delivered in Washington Friday on The Paydown of Federal Debt to the Bond Market Association in White Sulfur Springs WVa I am pleased to be with you this morning and note the Bond Market Associations twentyfifth anniversary Over the years I have enjoyed being associated with many of you in this audience My very best wishes to Heather Ruth on the last day of her tenure as president and congratulations to Micah Green upon his appointment Today I want to address a subject in which your group and the Federal Reserve share a keen interestthe paydown of the federal debt and its implications for the economy and financial markets While the magnitudes of future federal unified budget surpluses are uncertain they are highly likely to remain sizable for some time The dramatic improvement in projections of the budget balance in recent years reflects in large part the pickup in underlying productivity growth in the US economy which has boosted corporate profits and household incomes and thereby tax receipts In effect we built a tax structure on the assumption that the economy would grow over time at rates around those seen from the early s to the mids and this structure has generated considerably more revenue as the economys underlying growth rate has risen Restraint on expenditures also has contributed to the brighter outlook Tight limits on spending were imposed in response to the large deficits of the s and early s and defense spending was reduced following the end of the Cold War Both the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office have assumed that much of the accelerated productivity growth of the late s is likely to be sustained through the next decade No doubt a period of weakness in measured productivity is likely to accompany the current slowdown in economic activity However there is little in the recent data to suggest that any significant alterations in these agencies longerterm projections of structural productivity growth might be required Should we infer from these positive budget developments that unified budget deficits are no longer conceivable Hardly The substantial surpluses in retirement programs especially social security in recent years and in the nearerterm budget projections are on a cash basis Were we fully accruing the benefit liabilities inferable from existing law these retirement programs would currently be in deficit and contingent liabilities amounting to about trillion for social security alone would have been added to the current debt to the public When the baby boom generation retires and as the population subsequently ages further these contingent liabilities will come due andbarring an offsetting surplus in the remainder of the governments budgetwill be met by the issuance of Treasury securities shifting much of total federal liabilities from contingent liability to debt to the public At that point of course the unified budget will be in deficit Of more relevance for the nearer term current forecasts suggest that under a reasonably wide variety of possible tax and spending policies the resulting surpluses will allow the Treasury debt held by the public to be paid off Moreover well before the debt is eliminatedindeed possibly within a relatively few yearsit may become difficult to further reduce outstanding debt to the public because the remaining obligations will mostly consist of savings bonds wellentrenched holdings of longterm marketable debt and perhaps other types of debt that could prove difficult to reduce Whether economic developments and tax and budget choices will in the end produce surpluses of the order of magnitude currently projected is open to debate But the probability of substantial continuing surpluses is sufficiently high to require that at a minimum we begin to address their potential implications for fiscal policy decisionmakers financial markets and the Federal Reserve I have long argued that paying down the national debt is beneficial for the economy It keeps interest rates lower than they otherwise would be and frees savings to finance increases in the capital stock thereby boosting productivity and real incomes But the current budget projections are such that we need to consider what path of debt reduction is best for the economy The issue is complicated On the one hand higher national saving by raising the nations capital stock leaves the country better prepared to cope with the economic effects of the aging of the US populationand one way to achieve that higher saving is to run budget surpluses On the other hand after a point this increase in national saving comes at a cost Once Treasury debt reaches itsirreducible minimum additional surpluses will of necessity lead to the accumulation of substantial privatethat is to say nonfederalassets either in the Treasurys general fund or in government trust funds The decisions on how such funds should be invested by the government would necessarily be political ones and would lead to efforts by some groups to obtain via the political process funding that they could not obtain at least at the same price in private markets These efforts would likely result in distortions in the allocation of capital that must be balanced against the benefit to the nation of the increase in saving In fact it is the marketdriven allocation of capital and labor to their most productive uses that has fostered our recent impressive gains in productivity and encouraged inflows of capital that have enabled us to build an extraordinarily efficient capital stock despite quite modest levels of domestic savings The effectiveness of our markets in allocating capital is one of our nations most valuable assets We need to be careful not to impair their functioning It is regrettably too easy to envision political pressure being exerted to use government financing of investments to offset perceived capital market imperfections Experience suggests that in such cases the resulting returns earned on the investments are likely to fall short of market standards Moreover the social benefits of investment are likely to be very difficult to measure in practice opening the door to political interference in the allocation of funds It is difficult for example to envision effective constraints being placed on politically attractive investments by definedbenefit trust funds such as the social security trust fund Benefits are guaranteed by government irrespective of any losses to the fund Thus one must presume that even if our social security trust funds were to be so seriously impaired by mismanaged government investment that they dried up full benefits would be highly likely to be forthcoming despite the fact that under current law the social security trust fund has limited borrowing authority As a result prospective beneficiaries would have no incentive to police the investment policies of the trust fund To be sure we do have about trillion of assets administered in the definedbenefit plans of state and local governments While research in this area has been limited it does indicate that state and local pension funds have tended to underperform private pension funds if required to direct a portion of their investment within the state or to make economically targeted investments Some recent work has suggested that the negative effects of such requirements may have been less important in recent years than they were in the past but that conclusion remains speculative Along the same lines there is some evidence suggesting that returns on state pension funds have been lower where the proportion of trustees who are political appointees is higher Some have argued that methods could be devised to insulate government investment decisions from the political process even in definedbenefit funds perhaps by limiting such investments to index funds Even if such methods were successful the government would be investing only in publicly traded securities and so its investment might have an adverse effect on the relative financing costs of smaller often quite productive nonpubliclytraded firms Over time these effects would presumably be arbitraged away But such a process likely takes time and capital market imperfections in any event are likely to impede full arbitrage Arguably definedcontribution funds even if administered by a federal agency could insulate investment policy from political interference as well as potentially freeing investment from the straightjacket of holding only index funds It is highly unlikely that the beneficiaries of such funds would countenance politically convenient investments in their retirement funds Indeed the billion federally managed Thrift Savings Fund has been operated without such interference I should note however that conversion of social security from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan would fundamentally alter its nature One way to employ unified budget surpluses to finance increased investment would be to convert such funds into individual retirement accounts owned and administered by beneficiaries with the presumption that the funds would be fully dedicated to retirement In such an instance the resulting reduction in government saving would be offset by a rise in private saving so that total domestic saving would be maintained though the availability of newly owned private assets could reduce the propensity to save out of income somewhat Given concerns about the potential distorting effects of asset accumulation by the Treasury or in government definedbenefit plans we need to carefully consider the appropriate path of debt paydowns By addressing this issue now we can avoid an abrupt and potentially disruptive change in fiscal policy as the level of Treasury debt reaches its irreducible minimum Despite the clear advantages of paying down the federal debt I recognize that doing so has some potential adverse consequences even before the difficulties associated with government accumulation of private assets arise The Treasury market serves a number of useful purposes in addition to providing many of you with profitable employment Most obviously Treasury debt provides an asset that is free of credit risk a characteristic that is desirable for many investors especially in times of economic or financial turbulence Treasury yields also provide a benchmark for the quoting and pricing of risky debt In addition the size and liquidity of the Treasury market allow market participants to hedge interest rate risks easily and at low cost Moreover the liquidity of these securities enables participants to make rapid adjustments to their portfolios in times of market volatility Thus the elimination of Treasury debt does remove something of economic value and it will require that significant adjustments be made by market participants Indeed with marketable Treasury debt held by the publicthat is excluding the Federal Reserve but including foreign central bankshaving declined about percent in recent years to less than trillion some of these adjustments have already begun Reportedly firms have increasingly turned to swaps agency securities and even larger corporate debt issues to do their hedging After a period of transition such shifts arguably should not have any significant adverse effect on risk management As hedging activity moves from the shrinking Treasury market to alternative markets the liquidity of those markets should improve Yields on the alternative hedging instruments likely will track at least as closely with those on instruments commonly being hedged as do Treasury yields Similarly the loss of Treasury securities as benchmarks seems unlikely to result in major difficulties for market participants because alternative benchmarks are easy to envision For example in European bond markets swaps are already the most common benchmark Even in the United States the Treasury bill market has lost its benchmark status in recent years and has been replaced in that role by the eurodollar and eurodollar futures markets with no evident adverse effects on the operation of shortterm credit markets All of these alternative assets of course involve some degree of credit risk However given sufficient demand it seems likely to me that you or your colleagues could produce a nearly riskless security For example this could be accomplished with a very senior tranche of a collateralized debt obligation backed by highgrade corporate debt In short I am confident that US financial markets which are the most innovative and efficient in the world can readily adapt to a paydown of Treasury debt by creating private alternatives with many of the attributes that market participants value in Treasury securities Of course the resulting adjustments will not be perfect and in some cases will impose costs on financial market participants especially during the period of transition to new products and procedures However I believe that these costs are very likely to be outweighed by the benefits to the country of a higher capital stock and the resulting increases in productivity and income that appear to be the consequence of debt reduction Moreover competitive pressures and profit opportunities will provide a strong incentive for you and your colleagues in the financial industry to devise ways to minimize such costs Still the lack of Treasury securities might be a bigger problem for international investors than for domestic investors because they may be less well informed about US corporations As a result international investorsespecially official onesmay have a strong preference for US government instruments In such circumstances foreign investors may reduce on net their holdings of overall dollar assets as Treasury securities are paid down By itself such diminution in the demand for US dollar assets would tend to raise interest rates for US borrowers and conceivably put downward pressure on the dollars exchange rate However the evidence of the past year and a half gives little support to this notion Foreign private investors on net have run off their holdings of US Treasury securities while they have built up their holdings of private dollar assets by an even larger amount and the foreign exchange value of the dollar has appreciated A final valuable feature of the Treasury market is that it is a remarkably efficient system for funding federal government deficits Because demographic and other factors are surely likely to lead to the reemergence of deficits in the future one might argue that it would be best to continue to borrow at least limited amounts from time to time in order to keep the market operating so that it will be available when it is needed again While that is clearly an alternative we should also keep in mind that reestablishing the Treasury security market likely would not be all that difficult Borrowing needs in all likelihood would start out small so the market would have time to develop Moreover I have great confidence in your abilityor that of your successorsto initiate a new market for Treasury debt when that becomes necessary Like other financial market participants the Federal Reserve will also have to adjust to the loss of Treasury debt Currently Treasury securities are the permanent assets that correspond to the currency that is the Federal Reserves main liability Treasury securities have several features that make them particularly attractive assets for the Federal Reserve First the liquidity of the market allows the Federal Reserve to make substantial changes in reserves in a short period of time if necessary Second the size of the market has meant that the effects of the Federal Reserves purchases on the prices of Treasury securities have been minimal Third Treasury securities are free of credit risk Thus the Federal Reserve does not itself take on such risk when it holds them I should point out that we do not eschew risk because we fear becoming insolvent Rather we believe that the effects of Federal Reserve operations on the allocation of private capital are likely to be minimized when Federal Reserve intermediation involves primarily the substitution in the publics portfolio of one type of instrument that is free of credit risk currencyfor anotherTreasury securities As I discussed earlier it is important that government holdings of assets not distort the private allocation of capital and this goal applies to the Federal Reserve System as well as to the Treasury However if the Treasury debt is paid down as I trust it will be then the Federal Reserve will have to find alternative assets that still provide substantial liquidity and minimize distortions to the private allocation of capital Even before that time the Treasury market may become less liquid making it more difficult for the Fed to make purchases without affecting market prices Moreover declining Treasury debt presumably would at some point reduce the liquidity of the Treasury repurchase agreement RP market complicating the use of such operations in adjusting the shortterm supply of reserves In the short run the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase a substantial volume of Treasury securities In order to minimize the effects of its purchases on the market however it has established limits on the fraction of individual issues that it will hold going forward The Federal Open Market Committee FOMC as you know has also decided on a temporary basis to allow the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct RP operations with agency mortgagebacked securities as collateral as well as with Treasuries and direct agency debt Other changes that are already allowed under current statutes could be implemented to substitute to a limited extent for our holdings of Treasury securities For example the Federal Reserve could purchase outright Ginnie Mae securities which are fully backed by the Treasury It could also further broaden the types of collateral allowed for RP operations perhaps including certain municipal obligations or those of foreign governments Such an expansion could reduce the effects of Federal Reserve operations in the market for any particular type of collateral The FOMC has asked staff to explore all of these shortrun alternatives Over a longer time horizon more fundamental changes could be considered One possibility is to expand the use of the discount window by auctioning such credit to financially sound depository institutions Such auctions would enhance our ability to adjust the supply of reserves as needed and because these loans would be fully collateralized they would offer considerable protection against credit risk Another possibility is to add new assets to those the Fed is currently allowed by law to buy for its portfolio These assets could be used to provide a broader range of RP collateral a process similar in concept to the expanded use of the discount window as well as ultimately being added to our permanent portfolio One would hope that such additions would help to limit the distortions to particular markets caused by Federal Reserve purchases Of course what adjustments we make to our proceduresand when we make themdepend on how rapidly the supply of Treasury securities dwindles and on how long the Treasury market is not available As I noted earlier demographic forces are likely to cause unified budget deficits to reemerge at some point in the future and fresh supplies of Treasury securities to be issued At that time the Federal Reserve presumably would begin to shift our portfolio back toward the Treasury market The timing and extent of the reemergence of Treasury issuance will depend on underlying productivity growth and of course on the degree of fiscal discipline exercised by future American governments Finally in the period ahead the Federal Reserve will be seeking active consultations and discussions with you and other market participants as well as with the Congress before significant changes are made to Federal Reserve procedures and methods While the prospective paydown of Treasury debt presents us with challenges I am confident that with your help the Federal Reserve can make the needed adjustments and will be able to continue to implement monetary policy in the national interest The benefits of reducing our federal debt make the associated challenges well worth meeting Enron Offers Structured Weather Note Derivatives Week April Enron is offering via its Internet trading platform a structured weather note that gives investors financial exposure to the weather in US cities Mark Tawney Enrons Houstonbased head of weather derivatives who was in London last week said the note mirrors the weather risk element of the Kelvin weather bond Koch Energy Trading issued in November Tawney believes that by

anticipated economic slowdown in the United States has forced a downward reassessment of Canadas economic growth prospects in to between and percent the Bank of Canada said May The US economy is now projected to grow by between only and percent during even with the boost that will be provided by the expected growth of between and percent during the second half of the year the central bank said in its semiannual Monetary Policy Report The bank had indicated in a Feb update of its last semiannual report that it expected the Canadian economy to grow by about percent during based on US growth of percent It now looks as if growth over the first six months will average between and percent For the second half of the year we see growth picking up significantly to between and percent the latest report said The pace of activity in is expected to be somewhat stronger than in the second half of with the economy expanding at a rate slightly above the Banks estimate of potential output growth of percent Meanwhile the anticipated reemergence of excess supply in the Canadian economy will contribute to continued downward pressure on core inflation during the remainder of and core inflation is expected to average slightly less than percent for the remainder of then to increase to about percent by the end of the Monetary Policy Report said Increases in the overall Consumer Price Index are expected to remain volatile over the next few months but then to also fall to about percent by the end of the year if world energy prices remain near current levels it said The central bank stressed that the main risk to its projections for the Canadian economy remain the timing and strength of the projected resurgence of the US economy and the report noted that it will continue to monitor developments closely and make further adjustments to its trendsetting Bank Rate as necessary For example if consumer and business confidence in the United States does not improve this could lead to weaker consumption and investment spending it said Another development that the Bank will have to watch closely because of its possible implications for aggregate demand and inflation in Canada is the shift in international financial market sentiment that has led to a strengthening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar and other currencies SEC Urges More Use of Fair Value Pricing The Wall Street Journal May By Judith Burns US mutual funds cant rely on stale prices when calculating the value of their portfolios a senior Securities and Exchange Commission attorney said In a letter to the Investment Company Institute a leading fundindustry group Douglas Scheidt general counsel of the SECs investmentmanagement division said funds should be on the lookout for events that might require them to use fair value prices for certain securities rather than relying on the last quoted price Mr Scheidt said funds cant ignore major changes affecting pricing that occur after trading closes but before the calculation of the net asset value of the securities in fund portfolios Mutual funds typically compute their NAV once a day after the close of securities trading in major US markets using readily available quotations When that isnt possible funds must base calculations on the fair value of a security When calculating fairmarket value the SEC said funds should use appropriate methods to determine the price they might reasonably expect to receive in a current sale It recommended funds compare fairmarket pricing results with the nextday opening prices or actual sales prices to refine their pricing techniques and avoid using market quotes from dealers and pricing services that prove unreliable Funds that automatically use market quotations to calculate their NAVs without first verifying that the market quotations are readily available cannot be assured that the resulting NAVs are accurate Mr Scheidt wrote in his letter dated Monday Accuracy could be called into question if a fund ignores developments in markets such as Tokyo or Hong Kong which close to hours ahead of the US closing the SEC attorney said Market swings natural disasters terrorist activity or a major change in government or policy could have dramatic effect on foreign securities prices If a fund determines a significant event has occurred after a market closes that would affect the value of a security it holds the fund must use fair value pricing methodology rather than the closing price when valuing its portfolio said Mr Scheidt Funds cant just put their head in the sand Mr Scheidt said yesterday in an interview The ICI said it plans to distribute Mr Scheidts comments to its members The letter will be useful in providing guidance to the funds on this matter ICI spokesman John Collins said Fair value pricing isnt limited to nonUS securities In cases where trading in a US security is halted or there is a significant development after an early market close funds should no longer rely on the closing price or last quotation when calculating their NAV according to the SEC staff letter On the other hand where market quotes are deemed reliable it said funds must continue to use them and cant switch to fair value pricing Fair value pricing has been controversial for funds in recent years In the fall of there was an outcry from investors who complained they bought and sold shares without realizing some fund companies including Fidelity Investments relied on fair value pricing after Asian markets swooned Fidelity calculated an increase in the value of its Hong Kong and China fund using fairmarket pricing Investors could be harmed if a fund doesnt use fair value pricing since it could generate arbitrage activity that dilutes shareholder value the SEC letter noted If the funds NAV doesnt reflect uptotheminute changes shares could be overpriced benefiting investors who sell their stake while harming those who overpay to acquire shares Conversely if the fund is underpriced sellers would suffer at the expense of buyers Fair value pricing can protect longterm fund investors from shortterm investors who seek to take advantage of such situations Mr Scheidt said Additionally the SEC urged funds to provide investors with more information on when and how they will use fair value pricing saying plain English disclosure could reduce shareholders complaints about the practice and discourage arbitrage activity Small frys curbed Business Standard May By Sangita Shah The introduction of individual stock futures and options to replace the carry forward system will drive out the small retail investors from the stock markets market sources said According to market participants while derivatives as instruments have always been an alien system to the Indian market the technicalities involved will leave domestic investors bewildered The introduction of index futures in June can be termed as anything but successful This can be proved by the fact that the average daily volume of sensex futures has not crossed Rs crore Even Nifty futures which has performed better in terms of liquidity has barely registered an average daily volume of Rs crore This is a fraction of the cash market turnover of Rs crore collectively in a stable market Lack of understanding as to how the derivatives in stock markets are to be operated is the major roadblock in the success of the futures and options market in our country Bhavin Shah a derivatives trader at a domestic firm said In fact even the LC Gupta Committee has noted in its report in March that derivatives are not always clearly understood A few wellpublicised debacles sic involving derivatives trading in other countries has also created widespread apprehensions in the Indian publics mind While economic literature recognises the efficiency enhancing effect of derivatives on the economy in general and the financial markets in particular the Committee felt the need for educating public opinion as also the need to ensure effective regulatory checks It is worth mentioning that while regulatory checks have been implemented it has failed to educate public opinion Under the circumstances it is probably highhandedness on the part of the authorities to thrust upon them an alien system without giving an opportunity for smooth transition a fund manager said on conditions of anonymity However the fact should also be considered that if futures and options in individual stocks are introduced in the country India will be among the handful of global exchanges which have these systems The problem is compounded by the fact that there are few international precedents for India to draw on in the matter of options and futures in individual stocks The difficulty of defining a default Euromoney April Its not difficult to see why the market is so taken with credit default swaps For the protection buyer they are a quick and easy way for investors worried about a particular credit risk whether originally taken on via bonds loans trade notes or derivative counterparty exposure to gain reassurance without having to dispose of assets For sellers of protection default swaps provide the opportunity to buy into sectors to which they may have little or no exposure while avoiding the need to make a large capital investment up front The buyer pays a premium to the seller in return for an agreement that if a default occurs the seller pays a sum equal to the value lost and assumes ownership of the defaulted assets For their part dealers enthuse about being able to amalgamate limited liquidity in different parts of the market and convert it into a readily tradable instrument One of the big advantages of credit default swaps is that they are in pure derivative form says Glenn Barnes global cohead of credit derivatives at Merrill Lynch Its not like credit insurance where you have to suffer a loss before you get paid Credit default swaps have quickly become the largest component of the credit derivatives market making up over twothirds of global business According to Merrill Lynch the credit derivatives market accounted for billion of notional value in a figure estimated to top trillion by Derivatives are now absolutely central to the whole credit benchmark says Tim Frost European head of credit derivatives at JP Morgan Bond issues cannot be priced without knowledge of credit swap prices While the threat of a bear market lingers credit default swaps can only grow in popularity as investors seek to insulate themselves against risk Up until three years ago the only liquid protection from risk available to bond investors was to go short on bonds and hope they got cheap enough to buy before they had to deliver says Gordon Black a managing director in credit derivatives at Bear Stearns However because the credit default swap market is now taking centre stage the structure of swap agreements is coming under much closer scrutiny At the heart of the debate is the question how to define a credit event In reacting to continued confusion in the market over the issue the International Swaps Derivatives Association ISDA published a list of conditions each of which is sufficient on its own trigger a swap agreement These credit events are bankruptcy failure to pay restructuring repudiation or moratorium obligation default and obligation acceleration At the time of publication ISDA stated that these definition were critical to the growth in demand fro credit derivative transactions For a while this kept market participant quiet Although most felt that the arrangement was by no means perfect they were happy to use ISDAs list as the basis of their credit default swap contracts Having a blueprint for swap agreements attracted greater numbers of investors with no previous experience of default swaps and liquidity boomed But it wasnt long before the flaws in the plan began to surface At the end of following a year of catastrophic results and event risk USbased financialservices company Conseco restructured over billion of debt With the agreement of its banks it extended the maturity of its bonds and loans until the end of Under ISDA rules this triggered default and banks that had written protection for parties exposed to Conseco found themselves having to pay out Initially we were fairly confident about ISDA including restructuring instead of the old material change We saw it as a step on the road to default explains Black But people failed to recognize at the start that restructuring is not the same as default You cant demand par value in the case of a default This exposed the seller not only to credit risk but market risk as well In response to growing dissatisfaction with ISDAs guidelines some market participants have gone about simplifying matters unilaterally Dealers at a number of major US houses have decided to remove restructuring from the list of credit events included in credit default swap contracts There is a liquid market for these swaps in the US which trade at a discount to those with a restructuring clause Other institutions have attempted to establish a market in swaps that carry a more limited definition of default Enron an energy trader that is also a large dealer in credit markets is trying to build a market in pure bankruptcy contracts where bankruptcy is the only event that can trigger payment Regulators are warning investors to pay particular attention to the contract when they enter a credit default swap deal Even banks arent immune from confusion Last month it emerged that UBS Warburg was suing Deutsche Bank over an unpaid obligation UBS bought protection from Deutsche on Armstrong World lndustries which meant that if AWl defaulted on its payment or went bankrupt Deutsche would have to pay UBS so million In December AXTI filed for bankruptcy but in the meantime it had undergone a reorganization and created a holding company So when UBS applied for payment from Deutsche the German bank refused to pay on the grounds the name on the contract didnt match the name of the entity that had defaulted The dispute nearly ended up in court In London in February at Euromoney Institutional Investors International Bond Congress David Clementi deputy governor of the Bank of England voiced concern about the rapid growth of the credit derivatives market It is intrinsically more difficult to standardize the definition of a credit event compared with that of a price or interest rate the underlying for most other derivative products he said Market participants will therefore have to pay even greater attention to documentation Its all in the contract Creditrating agency Moodys Investors Service too has expressed concern that investors dont always know what they are buying When investors enter an agreement with a derivatives trader theyre talking to someone who works with these products full time So theyre getting into something fairly technical with a dealer who knows much more about the subject than they do says Isaac Efrat managing director in the structured finance department at Moodys Investors always enter the market from the same direction of wanting to sell protection whereas dealers tend to hedge everything The risk has to go somewhere and my guess is that its going to investors he continues Bankers unsurprisingly dispute this saying that the rating agency is underestimating investors knowledge of the structures Frankly I think people do understand the risks very well says Barnes at Merrill Lynch Some of the most recent entrants to the market pension funds and hedge funds have quickly picked up how credit default swaps work Others say that the whole point f default swaps is the exposure to risk Moodys is raining on the parade says a credit derivatives trader Credit default swapsare supposed to synthetically create the risk profile of a bond The buyer acquires the risk and is paid for it But most admit that there are kinks in the market that need ironing out Most of these are to do with one particular type of credit event Restructuring is where things come unstuck says a market participant The current restructuring clause in credit protection is more in favour of the buyer says Antonio di Flumeri director of credit derivatives at Deutsche Bank He believes that a companys restructuring shouldnt give rise to a default Banks holding loans and protection have the opportunity to realise a windfall gain by restructuring those loans to trigger the swap then delivering a cheaper asset to the seller of protection di Flumeri says Barnes agrees From the dealers perspective it isnt fair if the holder of the asset consents to the restructuring of a loan but this then triggers a credit event payment he says This gives the bank Without such protection financial institutions would lose out on capital relief An alternative which has found more favour among bankers is to place restrictions on what is deliverable in the case of a restructuring Under present arrangements if a bank sells a fiveyear protection on a loan or bond with the same length maturity and that debt subsequently needs to be restructured the original lending bank can agree to any terms it chooses It might for example allow a company to extend its debt to a maturity date of years in the future Because a restructuring has taken place that bank can then exercise the default swap and the seller of the protection ends up owning year debt This can be a real problem if that investor has been marking the bond or loan to market What is cheapest for the buyer of protection to deliver may cause problems for those who have sold protection says Black The answer may be for ISDA to set a limit to the time over which debt can be restructured perhaps restricting it to the same maturity as the original loan or two or three years beyond it This would limit bankers discretion and help redress the balance The question is can we convince the banks that this isnt limiting their ability to restructure asks one trader Theyre going to say What youre telling me I can only restructure over two years Thats not much of a restructuring Theyll ask for well say three maybe well settle on five Whatever the outcome of this debate as Euromoney went to press ISDA had not yet announced its conclusions it needs to be resolved quickly Everyone realizes that something has to give says a credit derivatives trader This market has only existed for three years and theres only been any sort of meaningful liquidity for two The last thing we want to do is shoot ourselves in the foot Unless an agreement is reached soon theres a real danger that the emergence of default swaps without restructuring in the US could lead to the establishment of a twotier market Certainly the possibility of Europe excluding restructuring is a remote one Ive tried to do credit default swaps without it a couple of times in Europe and it just doesnt work says one derivatives trader So that leaves it to the US to back down Or does it European investors do often tend towards European names and the same situation occurs in the US and Asia says a banker In theory each jurisdiction could have its own treatment This wouldnt be a disaster but it would affect liquidity Moodys Efrat says I can easily envision a day when there will be a wide range of credit default swap contracts determining what counts as a default Stephen Selig counsel at Baer Marks Upham goes further There is no reason why contracts shouldnt be specific to particular deals he says Unless Im missing something I really dont see why the scope of the protection and what gives rise to a trigger of the swap cant be part of the individual contract between the buyer and the seller ISDA tries to cover every eventuality and all you get is a long and unreadable list of conditions For the sake of practicality not to mention liquidity it seems likely that ISDA will come down on the side of a single set of criteria The market needs a standard product says Black at Bear Stearns You dont want to have to compare documentation every time you do a credit default swap because different jurisdictions have different standards Participants want to use credit default swaps for different purposes some want to hedge receivables others use them as a synthetic asset class and others still to hedge loans So a blueprint is also essential to avoid exploitation of new entrants in the market At the limit if everyone developed a contract which suited their own needs perfectly there would be no trading at all says Frost at JP Morgan Opinions are divided on whether this debate is causing a slowdown in the credit default swap market Says Deutsche Banks Flumeri Volumes are the highest they have ever been so I dont think the debate is having a significant impact But according to another trader If there was a universally accepted contract for credit default swaps volumes would explode But whatever ISDA announces this is likely to be some way off If people are expecting credit swaps to be as vanilla as interest rate swaps then they are sadly mistaken says Frost at JP Morgan I expect to have retired before there is one standard contract that everybody around the world uses Scott Marra Administrator for Policy Media Relations ISDA Fifth Avenue

Proposes FirstEver Regulation To Govern Limits on Affiliate Transactions BNA ISDA lobbies FASB on swaps Financial Times May By Vincent Boland The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has expressed concern that proposed changes to US accounting standards and tax regulations could have a negative impact on swaps transactions In a submission to the US Federal Accounting Standards Board ISDA said that definitions of liabilities and equity as residual interest were adequate and that it had asked the FASB to reconsider proposed changes and to retain the current accounting model It also said in a submission to the Internal Revenue Service that it was concerned that proposed changes to hedging regulations did not properly implement Congressional intent with regard to risk management standards that qualify for hedging treatment Corporates warm to charms of credit derivatives Reuters English News Service May By Tom Bergin European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments to hedge the risk their debtors wont pay up market participants said on Thursday Credit derivatives are insurancelike tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt They are mainly used by banks hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments The market remains small with only around a dozen nonfinancial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options We see corporate use as a big growth area for credit derivatives maybe the biggest says Bryan Seyfried vicepresident of Enron Credit in London Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other nonfinancial corporates Ralf Lierow director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives too he added This is not a trading book thing For us the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management Lierow said HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group It first started using credit derivatives in July Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business Lierow said Siemens uses credit default swaps the most liquid type of credit derivatives to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time the company tries to match this with default swap positions Hence if a customer fails to pay Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently There are occasional corporate users that have secured oneoff requirements for balancesheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction said Walter Gontarek head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible dealers said NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court However traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind The International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a payout in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtors failure to pay We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables Lierow said These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives There is little experience of the instruments which are barely a decade old in the corporate world Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin Clive Banks UK head of derivatives sales to buyside clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved Its about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces he said OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool Lierow said that Siemens which currently only buys credit protection planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the companys activities are concentrated You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals he said Fed Proposes Rules On Derivatives Intraday Lending Dow Jones May By Dawn Kopecki The Federal Reserve Board Wednesday proposed regulations that would place restrictions on intraday lending as well as on derivatives contracts between banks and their affiliates The Fed is seeking public comment on the proposal which would apply rule A of the Federal Reserve Act to derivatives contracts as well as to intraday extensions of credit The proposal is designed to limit a banks exposure to risk from an ailing affiliate Section A limits the ability of an insured depository institution to extend credit to or purchase assets from an affiliate It also establishes collateral requirements for credit transactions between banks and their affiliates Fed officials also proposed to extend rule B which requires that transactions between banks and their affiliates be on market terms to derivatives and intraday loans Under the interim rule overthecounter OTC derivatives contracts would have to be collateralized and the terms of the contract would have to reflect market prices Banks would also have to have procedures in place to handle derivatives transactions and intraday lending The interim rule which is not yet final and could change would go into effect Jan Its primary goal will be to establish barriers protecting depository institutions from the problems of a failing affiliate said Anthony Santomero president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia in a speech earlier this year Even with the best of intentions this regulation will prove difficult to codify and will be subject to close scrutiny The proposal was precipitated by legislation passed in late that overhauled the US financial service sector The GrammLeachBliley Act also required the Fed to issue rules by May on derivatives transactions done by banks The Federal Reserve Board also unanimously adopted a new rule that exempts certain transactions between banks and their affiliates from those same collateral standards as well as from other restrictions For example loans made by a bank to an unaffiliated borrower that then uses the loan to buy securities underwritten or sold by a brokerage affiliated with the bank would be exempt from rule A Banks urged to improve credit operational risk disclosure IFR April International banks will need to increase credit and operational risk disclosure to regulators according to a report issued by the Bank for International Settlements last week There is still a long way to go compared with the current practice said an official at the regulatory body Disclosure related to credit derivatives and banks use of internal credit risk rating methods as well as disclosure of methods for measuring and assessing operational risk was lacking the BIS report found Fewer than half of the banks that use credit derivatives disclosed their strategies and objectives for the use of such instruments it noted Furthermore only of banks disclosed a breakdown of type of credit derivative instrument used notional and fair values and the amount of credit risk bought or sold it added Similarly few banks provided summary information on the quality of on and offbalance sheet credit exposures based on internal ratings or external ratings the report said noting that this is an area where disclosure could be improved According to the report less than one quarter of the banks described how internal ratings are used in the banks capital allocation process The adequacy of disclosure related to the use of internal ratings will be an area of increased importance under the new Basle Capital Accord as banks will need to qualify to allow their internal based approaches to be considered the BIS report said Overall banks did disclose their objectives and strategies in using derivatives to hedge risks with of banks disclosing their objectives for the use of nontrading derivatives Fiftyseven banks from the Basle Committee member countries took part in the survey conducted by the BIS transparency working group The report found that while of respondents disclosed their riskbased capital ratio in accordance with the methods prescribed in the Basle Capital Accord only provided all of the information relevant to understanding how Basle requirements for market risk under internal models have been calculated Further only half of those surveyed disclosed whether they had an internal process for assessing capital adequacy and for setting appropriate levels of capital The absence of existing guidance at the time of the study is the likely reason for the poor marks for disclosure on operational risk management They should see how their operational risk management practices compare with guidance released in January said a BlS official A discussion paper elaborating on the tenets of the Basle Committees January proposal is slated for release toward the end of the summer The aim of the paper will be to assist banks in their implementation of the final proposal which is due for release at the end of the year The Basle Committee in its most recent draft proposals indicated its intention to levy an operational risk capital charge Although the BIS conducts annual reports on bank disclosure practices the survey cannot be compared directly with previous surveys as its focus shifted away from trading and derivatives to cover other areas such as operational risk Argentina crisis default swap ripples contained IFR April Argentine default swaps drove out last week as the sovereign teetered on the brink of a forced restructuring of its debt The ripple effect on credit default swaps in other Latin American sovereigns was limited however and even Argentine quotes were well off their highs by the end of the week Investment grade corporate default swaps mostly fell on the back of a wave of CDO portfolio position unwinds There was oneyear Argentina default swap trade as high as bp last Monday but by the end of the week the maturity was quoted at bpbp For much of the week the market was illiquid with major dealers saying that they would only come inside bidoffer spreads to do client trades There was mild curve inversion in Argentina by the end of the week with twoyear quotes at lOObpbp the fiveyear at bpbp and the year at bpbp The basis between default swaps and the asset swap value of Argentine FRB debt was very wide For much of the week FRBs were trading at levels at least bp tighter than the apparent realistic midpoint for default swaps Before the most recent crisis in confidence over Argentinas ability to raise funds and to maintain its currency peg to the dollar its default swaps were trading at levels tighter than the asset swap value of

Richard Cowden The Federal Reserve Board unveiled one of its most important regulatory projects in recent years on May and asked for comment on a proposed regulation that would implement key provisions in federal law limiting transactions between banks and their affiliates As required by Congress the Fed also released an interim rule to cover aspects of those transactions and finalized another rule that addresses exemptions from the law The proposed Regulation W marks the first time the Fed has formulated rules implementing restrictions under Sections A and B of the Federal Reserve Act two of the most important laws for federallyinsured banks Although the Fed has offered advice and interpretation before with respect to Sections A and B it has done so using legal rulings and advisory letters geared to specific cases Now the Fed is updating those interpretations and putting all of the information in one place The proposed Regulation W seeks to provide users with a single comprehensive reference tool for complying with and analyzing issues arising under sections A and B the Fed said Action in Three Parts In its May meeting the Fed took three distinct actions The Fed issued an interim rule effective Jan that requires banks to establish policies and procedures to monitor and control credit exposure from intraday credits and derivatives transactions with affiliates Although the effective date is delayed banks are expected to get to work on the new policies and procedures as soon as possible The interim rule also clarifies that both types of transactions are covered under Section B which means that banks will have to treat those transactions as armslength transactions just as they would with any other third party The Fed expressly declined to rule on whether derivative transactions between banks and affiliates are covered transactions under Section A asked for comment on the main text the proposed new Regulation W which would incorporate many existing Fed pronouncements and interpretations applying Sections A and B as well as adding some important new wrinkles and issued a final rule setting out various transactions that are eligible for exemption from Section A The rule was originally proposed June In addition the Fed is allowing opportunity for further comment on some of the exceptions during the comment process for the proposed Regulation W Why the Rule Matters The Feds threepart initiative is significant because Sections A and B are important statutes that protect banks from losses due to transactions with affiliated institutions such as securities units or mortgage firms According to the Fed the increasing scope and complexity of bank operations in recent years sparked more requests for guidance especially in connection with Section A which places quantitative limits on affiliate transactions And if transactions with affiliates were important before they are even more important now In Congress passed the GrammLeachBliley Act the financial services modernization law that was expressly crafted to allow even broader affiliations between banks securities companies and insurance firms The GLB Act which also amended key provisions in sections A and B gave the Fed until May to adopt rules addressing credit exposure in connection with intraday credits and derivatives transactions with affiliated institutions The Fed accomplished that task by issuing the interim rule Finally the rule is important because it could make things easier for everyone involved at least in theory By crafting an implementing rule for Sections A and B the Fed will be able to consolidate its doctrine In addition the rulemaking process gives bankers the opportunity to shape the final version of the rule Early Reaction Observers were still poring over the Feds initiative late May especially the interim rule and the newly proposed Regulation W They welcomed the Feds decision to delay the interim rules effective date saying the time between now and Jan will be put to good use Sarah A Miller general counsel of the American Bankers Association Securities Association told BNA May that the Fed took a fairly responsible approach especially in terms of taking limited action in the interim rule and leaving many of the tougher issues for the comment process Above all she said bankers hope that the rule once finished will provide muchneeded clarity with respect to Section A and Section B issues Were elated that the rule is out she said Miller also said the final rule on exemptions will be helpful especially provisions addressing certain loans to third parties She said the ABASA has been working for such changes since at least This is something our guys have been very much anticipating she told BNA Definitions at Issue Another analyst noted that the Fed gave a fairly narrow definition of intraday credits in the interim rule carving out exceptions for securities clearing and settlement transactions on behalf of affiliates Clearly they didnt want to interrupt normal daytoday dealings that dont present any real risk the analyst told BNA However there was some disquiet over other aspects of the Feds action For example analysts said the interim rule defines derivative transaction quite broadly so much so that many transactions will fall under the coverage of Section B According to the Fed derivative transaction means any derivative contract covered by the Boards capital adequacy guidelines which includes most interestrate currency equity and commodity derivative contracts and any similar derivative contract including credit derivative contracts Another potential sticking point is how the proposed Regulation W addresses independent credit judgments under CFR an interpretive rule The proposal establishes a brightline quantitative test but goes on to give bank examiners significant discretion to decide whether a bank has shown the independence required to gain a critical exemption under the rule Under the proposal even if the bank meets the quantitative test it may still be denied the exemption if the examiner decides that the bank is providing substantial and ongoing funding to the affiliate More Exemptions Could Be on the Way The Regulation W proposal also allows bankers to comment on potential additions to the exemptions in the final rule One would involve purchases by a bank of municipal securities from a brokerdealer affiliate that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission according to a Fed staffer Among other requirements the municipal securities must be eligible for purchase by a state member bank and must be rated by a nationally recognized rating organization or it must be part of a pool of securities of less than million Another would allow certain companies to charter a new bank and transfer assets to the new bank from affiliated institutions outside the restrictions of Section A A third possible exemption would govern certain credit card transactions A Fed official explained a typical case in which the proposed exemption would apply If a bank loan to a third party is pursuant to a general purpose credit card like a Visa or Mastercard and the third party buys a product from an affiliate of the bank were going to basically ignore that transaction he said Another Fed official said the purpose of the exemption was to accommodate extensions of credit that are not designed to subsidize an affiliate of the bank through transactions that elude the Sections A and B limitations Comments Due in Days The proposed rule applies to all federallyinsured banks However even though Congress has extended coverage of Sections A and B to savings associations the Office of Thrift Supervision OTS will have to craft its own rule the Fed said OTS officials told BNA May that they are studying the Feds proposal Comments on the proposal are due days after it is published in the Federal Register All existing Fed interpretations and staff opinions remain in effect until the new Regulation W becomes final Scott Marra Administrator for Policy Media Relations ISDA Fifth Avenue Rockefeller Center th

Flexible Approach To Prevent Cope With Financial Crises BNA Gramm Says Changed Markets Demand Dramatic Review Reform of Securities Laws BNA Lack of banking safeguards in HK Financial Times Japan risks slide into downward spiral Financial Times Accounting Shift Lifts Deutsche Profits American Banker Argentinas strife not over yet Financial Times Feds McDonough sees global strains from slowdown Reuters English News Service May NEW YORK May Reuters Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William McDonough said on Thursday the international financial system is showing some signs of strain from a slowdown in global growth McDonough in remarks prepared for delivery to a banking group in Frankfurt Germany said there is no broad agreement on how to handle international financial crises During the latter part of the s the international financial system has endured perhaps its greatest stress in the postwar period and currently we again are seeing signs of strain associated with the global slowdown in growth McDonough said in a text of his speech released in advance The New York Fed chief did not comment further on the global economy or discuss the US economy in the speech which focused on global financial stability McDonough is also chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision which recently completed a new accord on bank capital standards There is a broad consensus on the need to strengthen financial institutions at the national and international level in order to create more crisis resistant economies McDonough said But there is no comparable degree of consensus on how to best handle international financial crises once they do erupt In particular there is unease that the current approach to crisis management that has evolved out of the experiences in Mexico and Asia notwithstanding its successes in some cases entails solutions that are potentially too costly he said Critics feel the solutions entailed repeated reliance on largescale support packages introduced adverse incentives or moral hazard and were in themselves a source of uncertainty and potential instability McDonough added He advocated a flexible casebycase approach to crisis management adding that regulators should strive for minimalist intervention The role of regulators is not to limit banks opportunities for growth and profit At the same time if we encourage responsible behavior we must not create the illusion that we will rescue every institution that does not succeed he said McDonough Advocates Flexible Approach To Prevent Cope With Financial Crises BNA May By Jeffrey Goldfarb A flexible casebycase approach with minimal intervention by regulators is the best way to prevent and cope with financial crises said William McDonough the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Speaking May in Frankfurt Germany McDonough said bank supervisors around the world should be working to enable banks to better manage their businesses and their risks At the same time if we are to encourage responsible behavior we must not create the illusion that we will rescue every institution that does not succeed he said McDonough said that disclosure practices by banks although improved over the past decade have not kept up with the many changes in the way they manage their risk He recommended that banks rethink what they consider proprietary information It is critical to approach the question of disclosure as users of financial statements he said Shareholders creditors and counterparties cannot understand the risks of their own exposures to a bank until they first understand that banks appetite for risk and its approach to and methodologies for managing risk What should drive this debate is market participants need for information to make sound and secure credit and investment decisions rather than the concerns some have about what was once considered secret Amidst his remarks an advance text of which was released in New York McDonough briefly commented on the state of the global economy saying there are some unfavorable signals During the latter part of the s the international financial system has endured perhaps its greatest stress in the postwar period and currently we again are seeing signs of strain associated with the global slowdown in growth he said McDonough explained that the solutions to recent crises in Mexico and Asia even though successful may have led to certain currently held tenets that are too costly introduce adverse incentives or moral hazards and are in themselves a source of uncertainty and potential instability But the alternatives he said look even more unpalatable in their implications Notwithstanding considerable efforts at the public and private level to search for a better way no magic bullet formula has been found Nor is one likely to be available In essence McDonough said the quest for some broad universal solution to financial crises is a Pollyannalike pursuit If history is any guide he said new developments in markets and practices quickly will render obsolete those measures that might seem well attuned to todays circumstances For that reason McDonough encouraged a supremely tactical and creative casebycase approach to handling crises He specifically argued against standstill solutions which suspend debt service usually in conjunction with the imposition of capital controls McDonough said that approach in his opinion could make investors skittish and make it harder to generate support for honoring contractual commitments Standstills also undermine market discipline of and ownership by the local authorities he said To sum up I believe the one size fits all disposition inherent in the standstills approach risks making situations much worse than they need to be he said The only thing that strikes me as predictable under such an approach would be that market access would be harmed across the board Just as bailouts may encourage too much risk taking efforts to orchestrate preemptive bailins may encourage too little Gramm Says Changed Markets Demand Dramatic Review Reform of Securities Laws BNA May By Rachel Witmer Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm RTexas said May that the changes in the US securities markets since the s and especially in the last years demand a dramatic review and reform of securities regulation Gramm had previously announced his intention to conduct a toptobottom review all of the securities laws with the intention of modernizing them Speaking at a meeting of the Security Traders Association Gramm said that the review will be openended and that he will not prejudge the conclusions from the effort The senator said that the question he asks in looking at laws and regulations is Are the benefits of this regulation in the market as it exists today worth what were paying for them In addition he emphasized that there will continue to be dramatic change in the markets and said I want the change to be dictated by the markets and not the government One change that he suggested might come in the long run is that securities markets per se could become a thing of the past Im not certain that markets are not obsolete he said Later in his remarks Gramm clarified his statement saying I dont know if markets make sense any more He made an analogy between markets and traditional book stores which have serious competition from online book stores The Internet has revolutionized the book market Gramm said He then asked Is a centralized market necessary NYSEs Survival At another point in his remarks Gramm suggested that as allelectronic markets are proliferating and changing competition in the securities markets the New York Stock Exchanges survival is not guaranteed In other comments Gramm emphasized that while he may refer an individual to the White House for consideration as a potential nominee for the chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission the president is going to name the chairman and not me Asked about the length of time it is taking for the White House to nominate someone for that position Gramm said I dont see that any great harm is coming from it Gramm told reporters after his remarks that he hoped the administration will nominate someone who was knowledgeable openminded and free market Finding all those qualities on one person is hard he said On the topic of decimals Gramm said that he did not see the recent decimalization of the securities markets as a fundamental reform As of April all securities are priced and traded in decimals instead of fractions While on the House side there is some interest in exploring the effects of decimalization Gramm said I dont see anything in it now that would induce me to want to go back and hold hearings about it Lack of banking safeguards in HK Financial Times May By Joe Leahy Hong Kong lacks many of the formal safeguards in place in the UK and Australia to protect banking consumers said a study yesterday by the territorys de facto central bank Joe Leahy reports from Hong Kong Hong Kong has no general competition law no regulator with an explicit mandate for protecting banking consumers and no ombudsman scheme to process complaints the consultative study by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority HKMA found As the Hong Kong market is becoming more sophisticated and more competitive and as consumer issues are coming more to the fore it is timely to consider whether the current arrangements in Hong Kong remain appropriate it said Despite its probusiness bias Hong Kong has been forced to reexamine the issue of depositor protection following moves to deregulate the banking sector Japan risks slide into downward spiral Financial Times May By Gillian Tett Falling exports to Asia and the US and the fragility of its banking system mean Japan risks sliding into a downward spiral with severe regional consequences for trade the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned yesterday in its latest halfyearly report The OECD report says Japan may need to bail out the banks a move the government has ruled out The report comes at a critical time for the new government of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi The Parisbased thinktank attracts considerable respect in Japan and Mr Koizumi is due to make his inaugural speech to parliament on Monday in which he will set out the governments economic policy The OECD report asserts that the level of bad loans is probably larger than the government admits meaning that some banks may not have sufficient capital to write off their bad debts In some cases realistic writeoffs might even wipe out the capital altogether requiring banks to reduce the scale of their operations raise capital in the market or seek public financial support it says The condition of the banking system is likely to be a key focus of Mr Koizumis speech He has pledged to introduce measures to clear out the bad loans rapidly under pressure from countries such as the US The government insists the banks have sufficient capital to complete this task Public funds should be injected only when the financial system faces a crisis Hakuo Yanagisawa financial reform minister said recently Some Ybn Dollars bn of public funds were injected into the largest banks in But many analysts and diplomats fear that without government help the banks will be too weak to write off their bad loans rapidly The mountain of bad loans has damaged corporate confidence and left the financial sector reluctant to lend However forcing banks to cut their loans to unviable borrowers could lead to more bankruptcies and rising unemployment in the short term the OECD admits Managing the loan cleanup will be a huge task for the authorities in particular as flagging confidence may dictate that it will have to be carried out in a short period of time it says The timing of the cleanup is unfortunate since Japan is suffering the knockon effects of the slowdown in the rest of the global economy through lower exports The OECD suggests that if more funds are injected into the banks that the bank managers should be sacked and the shareholders should not be rescued However any fresh injections of public funds could trigger strong public protest It could also fuel Japans spiraling debt burden which is projected to hit per cent of GDP in and per cent next year The OECD calculates the government will need to tighten fiscal policy by percentage points of GDP by simply to stabilise the debt This is currently equivalent to Ybn a sum exceeding total central government tax revenue On current growth trends tax revenue would therefore need to be doubled if the adjustment occurred on the tax side alone The OECD added that monetary policy would need to be highly supportive It expects to see per cent growth in calendar and per cent growth next year higher than many analysts are projecting Accounting Shift Lifts Deutsche Profits American Banker May FRANKFURT Deutsche Bank AG Europes largest bank said Thursday that firstquarter earnings rose fueled by lower taxes and a new accounting rule for derivatives even as revenue from investment banking declined Net income climbed to million or a share The results included a gain of million from the accounting change Chief executive Rolf Breuer is trying to reduce Deutsche Banks reliance on investment banking and emphasize businesses such as fund management and consumer banking Rivals in the securities business including Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported lower profit in the first quarter Deutsche Bank said its investment banking revenue declined Another rival reported a similar expectation I expect to see growth from asset management and personal banking this year said Helmut Hipper who helps manage about billion at Union Invest GmbH in Frankfurt Investment banking wont be the main driver Deutsche Bank shares fell Thursday by after having risen in early trading Without the accounting gain profit was down in the first quarter Under a new International Accounting Standards Board rule called IAS changes in the value of certain derivatives were included in trading income for the first time If we take away the accounting change profit was down in the first quarter said Manfred Bleijenberg an analyst at Delta

this an improvement in our profit situation compared with our competition Argentinas strife not over yet Financial Times May By Thomas Catan For the past six months Argentinas markets have been dominated by a single question can the country restart its economy in time to avoid a default on its Dollars bn in debt The answer is not yet clear In his first six weeks back in charge of the economy Domingo Cavallo has done much to improve a bad situation after nearly three years of recession He has transformed a fractious political scene and restored the backing of the International Monetary Fund His task was complicated by the fact that Argentina missed its first quarter fiscal target Mr Cavallo has taken a range of measures to rein in the burgeoning fiscal deficit to meet the Dollars bn target agreed with the IMF for this year Most recently he moved to eliminate virtually all exemptions on value added tax cut Dollars m in spending and increased a tax on financial transactions from per cent to per cent But those steps have only increased concern that Argentina will not climb out of recession in spite of his prediction this week that the economy will be growing at a per cent clip in the last quarter of the year Mr Cavallos strategy is unconventional To restart growth he has eliminated import tariffs on capital goods to encourage investment as well as cut VAT on those items from per cent to per cent He will also unveil a series of competitiveness plans for sectors of industry that have been hurt by the overvaluation of the peso over the past couple of years The aim is to regain competitiveness without breaking the decadeold peg to the dollar which would be disastrous in a country where the vast majority of public and private sector debt is denominated in dollars But investors still question whether the strategy can work and have pushed interest rates up to astronomical levels Because of those rates Argentina has long been unable to borrow on international markets Last week it was forced for the first time to cancel a biweekly auction of treasury bills Investors will be watching closely to see if Argentina can hold its next scheduled auction on May If it cannot then the fears that the country will have to restructure its debt will again grow stronger stoking volatility throughout emerging markets Following a brief rally at the start of the year Argentinas

Journal Darwinism With Chinese Characteristics The Asian Wall Street Journal UK Building Societies To Use Derivatives For Credit Risk Dow Jones International News May LONDON Dow Jones The UK Treasury said Thursday that it is proposing legislation to allow building societies to use derivatives to protect themselves against credit risk Building societies are already allowed to use certain types of derivatives to protect themselves against interest rate risk currency risk and house price fluctuations But the treasury proposal agreed by the Building Societies Commission will allow the building societies to use derivatives to protect themselves against credit risks a treasury spokesman said Unlike banks which are allowed to use derivatives to protect themselves against credit risk building societies havent been allowed to do so so far because of a clause in the Building Societies Act The proposal will be put to parliament and is likely to be approved unless a member of parliament opposes it the spokesman said The BSC considers the credit derivatives market to be sufficiently developed to offer building societies broad and flexible protection Credit derivatives will initially be used only by societies which already have a sophisticated treasury management capability the treasury said Currency swap agreements strengthen Asian cooperation Financial Times May By Edward Luce Japan yesterday announced that it had concluded bilateral swap agreements with Thailand South Korea and Malaysia as part of the regions continued progress towards strengthened monetary cooperation The agreements which were reached on the first day of the annual conference of the Asian Development Bank in Honolulu come a year after the Asian member countries plus China Japan and South Korea pledged mutual central bank support at a meeting in Chiang Mai The swap arrangements were designed to provide the former victims of the Asian financial crisis with firepower to fight off any speculative attacks on their currencies Japan said it was also negotiating central bank swap agreements with the Philippines and China But Seichiro Murakami Japans deputy finance minister would not disclose the nature or the terms of the swaps agreements except to say they were not based on the defense of any preagreed exchange rate levels Most of the regions economies have adopted free floating or managed float currencies after speculative attacks obliterated their exchange rate pegs with the US dollar in The bilateral deals provide Korea with Dollars bn Pounds bn in possible currency support Dollars bn for Malaysia and Dollars bn for Thailand Tun Daim Zainuddin Malaysias finance minister said the agreement which comes in addition to the Dollars bn pledged in mutual swap support by Asian countries last November would help prepare the region for any eventualities We will not be caught by surprise this time said Mr Daim Our currencies are not at risk now In fact in most of the Asian countries our reserves have increased Mr Daim also pointed out that the Dollars bn in potential support for Malaysia came in addition to a further Dollars bn in currency support that had been pledged by Japan under the Miyazawa plan named after Japans former finance minister Unlike the Miyazawa pledge which comes free of broader conditions only per cent of the bilateral swap agreement can be drawn before triggering control by the International Monetary Fund Wednesdays announcements mark a weakening of Japans drive towards the creation of an Asian Monetary Fund vetoed by the US in the late s In contrast to Tokyos original goal of devolving more decisions to Asia Japan described the bilateral swap agreements as complementary to the broader financial framework supervised by the International Monetary Fund in Washington The Honolulu agreements which will be reviewed in three years form part of a broader drive by Asian countries to strengthen regional cooperation following the crisis Such efforts which span deeper trade liberalisation within Asian and greater political dialogue between Asian and its east Asian neighbours have been given further impetus by the damping effects of the US economic slowdown on the regions hightech export sector Paul ONeill US Treasury secretary told delegates at the opening ceremony of the ADB annual conference that in spite of the regions impressive recovery since Asian countries had to accelerate and deepen efforts to restructure their financial and corporate sectors Mr ONeill whose remarks were clearly directed at South Korea Thailand and Indonesia which are still struggling to resolve the overhang of bad debts from the crisis also urged Japan to take steps to boost aggregate global demand by confronting obstacles to the revival of domestic demand Greenspan Backs RiskBased Pricing Of Deposit Insurance Provided by FDIC BNA May CHICAGOFederal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan May called for more risksensitive pricing of deposit insurance provided to banks by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation saying recent FDIC proposals to move toward riskbased pricing are useful Greenspan spoke at during the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicagos th Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition Federal Reserve Board Governor Laurence H Meyer who spoke at the conference the same day said the system must be adapted to manage the challenges posed by new technologies new financial strategies and the globalization of the financial services industry Though Greenspan said federal regulation of the financial services industry has provided an admirable degree of stability to banks and investors he said these benefits come at a significant cost and reform is needed He called for financial industry supervisory policies that promote the type of market discipline that existed prior to the erection of current safety net structures which evolved in the wake of the Great Depression In addition he reminded large institutions engaged in risky practices and their investors that the safety net cannot and will not insulate them from every type of financial crisis Marketbased reforms would better protect investors reduce costs to the economy and allocate risk more equitably the Fed chairman said While valuing the benefits of stability that the safety net confers we nonetheless need to recognize that the benefits are not without costs Greenspan said In this context Greenspan added reform of the safety net must remain on the agenda I believe this means being very cautious about purposefully or inadvertently extending the scope and reach of the safety net It also means supervisory reform to create as best we can inducements to bank behavior similar to those that would exist with no safety net And it means I think that there be a presumption that uninsured claimants are at risk It appears politically infeasible to eliminate government subsidies of deposit insurance altogether but more risksensitive pricing is nonetheless helpful and prudential regulation has already begun to move in the right direction to reduce the safety net subsidy Greenspan said The socalled financial safety net as currently configured is comprised of banking regulation deposit insurance the Feds discount window and access to Fedwire and daylight overdrafts he said He said these structures provide depository institutions and market players with a degree of safety liquidity and solvency never before seen in economic history At the same time this structure comes at a cost to the economy Among other things Greenspan pointed to distortions in the price signals used to allocate resources inducements for institutions to take excessive risks and relatively high degrees of government supervision as a strategy for limiting moral hazard FDIC Proposal Useful To avoid these distortions Greenspan suggested reforms aimed at pricing and managing the safety net in a manner aimed at simulating what the markets alone might do Toward this end he called for fairer pricing mechanisms with respect to FDIC insurance premiums Greenspan did not discuss specific components of the recently released FDIC reform proposal but he described it as useful and commented that the plan moves the agency toward better pricing to safety net access On April the FDIC proposed a system under which all institutions would pay riskbased premiums based on indexed coverage levels and a merger of the bank and savings association insurance funds DER A The House Financial Services Committee will broach the controversial subject of how best to reform the deposit insurance system in a hearing scheduled for May Greenspan also called for regulatory structures aimed at making capital requirements sensitive to each banks particular risk profile and exposure He said supervision and examination policies are moving in this direction and are evident in the new Basel Capital Accord Finally Greenspan called for greater market disciplinea factor that preserved the banking system prior to the development of the safety net The real presafetynet discipline was from the market and we need to adopt policies that promote private counterparty supervision as the first line of defense for a safe and sound banking system he said Disclosure Key Greenspan Says To promote this concept Greenspan called for wider disclosure by financial institutions so counterparties can better evaluate risk While banks are already subjected to significant degrees of disclosure Greenspan said the quantity and quality of the data is often uneven He suggested that all entities could should and may soon be required to disclose more and better data But Greenspan stressed that market discipline will never be achieved unless uninsured private counterparties understand that they will not be protected by the safety net He suggested too many players live under the false assumption that they will always be made whole under a de facto toobigtofail policy Let me remind you that the ten largest US banking organizations fund only about onefourth of their worldwide banking assets with insured deposits Greenspan said Let me also remind you that the leastcost resolution exception contained in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act does not require that all uninsured creditors be made whole but rather only that they be made no worse off than they would have been if the bank were liquidated The potential for greater market discipline at large institutions is substantial Greenspan said he could conceive of rare situations when the FDIC or other governmental resources would temporarily be used to sustain failing institutions pending managed liquidation but that indefinitely propping up insolvent intermediaries is the road to stagnation and substantial resource misallocation as recent history attests Meyer Seconds Reform Call Meyer in his speech also argued for a more riskbased regulatory structure Meyer acknowledged the FDICs April proposal for reform but would not comment on it Meyer complimented the agency on its diligence but said the board would withhold judgment on the plan until it has had a chance to fully review it There seems to be a widespread feeling which I share that additional or at least improved efforts toward limiting moral hazard enhancing market discipline and lowering taxpayer liabilities should and can be made Meyer said Our world is a rapidly changing place with technological change financial engineering globalization and deregulation combining to alter the realities we all face As a result all of us must be willing to adapt old policies and adopt new one if the circumstances require Meyer noted that unfortunately existing riskbased capital standards are becoming divorced from the realities of modern risk management for a growing number of financial institutions As such he said the Basel Accords capital ratios have become a less reliable tool for determining the capital strength of a particular firm Meyer said the new Basel Capital Accord creates standards that will reflect the true risks being taken by the most financially sophisticated and complex banks He called on bankers to provide public comments on the proposal to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision by the end of May It is of the highest priority that for the most financially sophisticated and complex banks we make the capital standards more reflective of the risks that they are in fact taking Meyer said FDICs Murton Speaks Arthur J Murton director of the FDICs division of insurance also spoke at the conference He said that in developing the reform plan the FDIC hoped to make significant improvements in the safety net while acknowledging political realities We hoped it would represent an intersection of sound economic and financial principles on the one hand and political realities on the other Murton said during the same panel discussion with Meyer Our goal was to offer a framework that with further discussion and modification could generate a consensus around these issues and could make its way through the legislative process We might have come up with a different approach if we had started from scratch Instead we recognized that passing banking legislation without a banking crisis requires consensus Murton said the plan calls for a merger of the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund and the elimination of current restrictions on charging riskbased premiums In addition the plan calls for indexation of insurance coverage levels to reflect inflationary changes and a shift from the current percent Designated Reserve Ratio to a target level between certain ranges The plan also suggests the development for the first time of a rebate system when certain triggers are achieved SEC CFTC Propose Joint Rules For Trading of New Security Futures BNA May The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission announced May that they have proposed joint rules to implement new statutory provisions relating to security futures products Security futures are single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indicesgiven new life by last years sweeping Commodity Exchange Act reform legislation after a nearly year ban In related matters the SEC May proposed rules and a new registration form for designated contract markets and derivative transaction execution facilities to use to register as national securities exchanges to trade the new instruments Release No Joint Regulation Under the law security futures are securities under the federal securities laws but may be traded on either futures or securities exchanges The CFMA also established a framework for the joint regulation of security futures products by the CFTC and SEC the agencies noted However they added futures contracts on broadbased indexes remain under the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC Accordingly the SEC and CFTC related they proposed joint rules regarding the distinction between broadbased and narrowbased security indexes According to the regulators the CFMA defines the criteria for an index to be considered narrowbased including among other factors the market capitalization of each security in the index and the dollar value of that securitys average daily trading volume The statute also requires the two agencies jointly to specify the methods that must be used to determine these values In their release the SEC and CFTC said the proposed rules are designed to fulfill that statutory mandate as well as to address other issues that arise in the application of the definition of narrowbased security index They noted that trading in security futures products may begin Aug provided certain regulatory requirements are met After considering any comments the agencies said they expect to adopt final rules prior to Aug New Rules to Improve Competitiveness Of European Markets Commissioner Says BNA May Key legislation needed to make European financial markets more competitive with US markets is expected to be introduced by early Frits Bolkestein a Dutch member of the person European Commission said May In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute Bolkestein reaffirmed the European Unions commitment to requiring all EUbased companies to use the International Accounting Standards IAS practices in their record keeping in order to enhance transparency and provide higher quality financial information to investors across the world The use of one global accounting language will greatly benefit European companies It will help them compete on equal terms for global capital Bolkestein said He added that the legislation would require companies to begin preparing their consolidated accounts using IAS by Bolkestein also said he is hopeful that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will begin to accept financial statements prepared by firms in the European Union without requiring them to be reconciled with the generally accepted accounting principles GAAP standard used in the United States A major reason that changes are needed in the European Unions financial regulations is because of the unprecedented volume of mergers and acquisitions between American and European firms Another reason is that the European Union has established a goal of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledgebased economy in the world capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion Bolkestein said Since Bolkestein said the European community has added jobs and has seen improved competition and productivity add percent to gross domestic product growth because of measures taken to create a single market for financial services If the European Union is successful at restructuring its financial system by Bolkestein said he sees other benefits to include a lower cost of capital for all companies a deeper and more vibrant venture capital market lower costs of purchasing financial products and higher returns on pensions and investment funds To realize those benefits Bolkestein said the European Commission would like to see an integrated securities market in place by replacing the individual domestic securities markets of the European Unions member states Mergers and alliances between existing exchanges are already breaking down barriers pooling liquidity reducing clearing costs decreasing volatility and increasing transparency Bolkestein said He added that Europe is also seeing a marked increase in the number of online brokerage accounts which further contributes to efficiency and transparency but also creates a greater need for changes in the way the European Union regulates its financial sector Top securities lawyer set to head SEC Financial Times May By John Labate President George W Bush yesterday named securities lawyer Harvey L Pitt to head the US Securities and Exchange Commission after one of the administrations longest searches yet to fill a key post If approved by the Senate Mr Pitt would replace Arthur Levitt who stepped down as chairman in February after more than eight years Mr Bush is expected to send a formal nomination to the senate soon but no date for a confirmation hearing has been set Mr Pitt a partner at New Yorkbased law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver Jacobson is widely regarded as one of the countrys leading experts on securities law and one of its toughest litigators His long list of clients has included Ivan Boesky for whom in he negotiated a m settlement with SEC officials on insider trading charges Other clients include LLoyds of London the New York Stock Exchange and all big five accounting firms The move would return Mr Pitt to the SEC where he worked for a decade after law school and where at age he served as its youngest ever general counsel He has remained at Fried Frank Harris since leaving the SEC in The planned nomination comes as the SEC faces a number of difficult issues including decisions on the structure of securities trading as more markets inside and outside the US seek to become publicly traded companies Were heading into a period of globalisation that will call for change said Richard Phillips former SEC assistant general counsel and partner at the law firm Kirkpatrick Lockhart It wont be for congress to take the lead but a chairman with vision and Harvey could be that kind of chairman The decision to nominate Mr Pitt was welcomed by Senator Phil Gramm the Republican Chairman of the Senate banking committee which oversees the SEC I look forward to working with him and anticipate prompt consideration of his nomination by the banking committee he said Mr Pitt is known as a tireless worker who employs three secretaries to work round the clock for him Some people are going to have to run quicker and run longer to keep up with him but the vast majority of people here are delighted with the choice said one SEC staff member Mr Pitt will be closely watched in the coming months for his views on several controversial rules passed in the final year of Mr Levitts term Among them are those on overseeing consulting services by accounting firms and a new disclosure rule Regulation Fair Disclosure fiercely opposed by securities firms The administration encountered unexpected difficulty in filling the top SEC job Several leading candidates withdrew from the process or turned down offers Mr Bush still has to fill forthcoming vacancies among the SECs commissioners He named Laura Unger a corn missioner as acting SEC chairman soon after Arthur Levitt stepped down Bush Intends to Nominate Roseboro for Treasury Job The Wall Street Journal May WASHINGTON President Bush announced his intent to nominate Brian C Roseboro of New York financialservices giant American International Group Inc to be assistant Treasury secretary for financial markets The job involves making and implementing policy on capital markets and federaldebt management Mr Roseboro is deputy director of marketrisk management for AIG Mr Roseboro earlier worked at financialservices firm SBC Warburg Dillon Reed from to and at First National Bank of Chicago from to the White House said From to he held several positions at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York including chief dealer for foreignexchange trading Election records show Mr Roseboro didnt contribute to Mr Bushs presidential campaign although AIGs political action committee contributed to it and also gave to his GOP rival Arizona Sen John McCain AIG Chairman Maurice Hank Greenberg raised at least for Mr Bush in the insurance and financialservices industries Darwinism With Chinese Characteristics The Asian Wall Street Journal May By Pu Yonghao The expansion of Chinas capital markets is central to the governments plan to finance longterm economic growth While observers have focused primarily on efforts to reform and broaden the equity markets two other developments are important to meet the objective a mature debt market and a wider variety of derivative products About companies are listed on Chinas domestic stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen About are stateowned enterprises and some of the total issued shares are state held The two bourses combined had a market capitalization of billion at end of though some twothirds about billion of A shares which can be purchased only by Chinese investors are in state hands Chinese companies generally turn to banks for funding By the end of bank lending was billion equivalent to of Chinas gross domestic product In the wake of the Asian financial crisis the government realized that a dependence on bank lending leaves both the corporate and banking sectors vulnerable to crises That is why it has decided to expand the capital markets to finance longterm growth If all goes well the market cap of the two boards together is likely to double to trillion by and play a leading role in the countrys evolution into a market economy The reasons for this kind of growth are numerous First Chinas economy should grow at an annual average rate of between bringing total GDP to about trillion based on an inflation of The countrys high savings rate of currently billion should provide ample capital to facilitate the expansion Second the government is pushing forward with the reform of SOEs Privatization the reduction state holdings and expansion of the private sector will increase the marketcapitalizationtoGDP ratio Listing SOEs will deepen the restructuring program and usher in good corporate governance Moreover the governments fiscal resources are limited Revenues comprise only of GDP and socialwelfare costs are rising The growth of the stock markets is likely to help expand Chinas private sector and bolster employment at a time when many SOEs are downsizing their labor forces The stock markets will also become an important vehicle for channeling longterm investment and thus help increase the efficient allocation of capital and improve returns on infrastructure projects And finally foreign investors and investment banks are expected to play an active role in the domestic markets after Chinas accession to the World Trade Organization But this picture of thriving capital markets will be incomplete without the speedy evolution of debt trading and derivative instruments The development of a debt market is important because bank savings remain Chinas primary investment vehicle despite a tax on deposit interest income and historically low interest rates Bonds generally offer relatively high returns with low risk and fill the gap between highreturn highrisk equities and lowreturn yet safe bank deposits Moreover social security funds need to hold bonds to balance their portfolios A mature debt market diversifies the financing channels of enterprises enabling them to gain capital leverage Debt pricing is more sensitive to interest rates spurring more efficient capital pricing and thus allocation A mature debt market can also help finance the states budget deficit and provide capital for longterm construction projects Government bonds enable effective monetary policy through openmarket operations The use of bonds to control the base money supply reduces the reliance on a credit plan for implementing macroeconomic objectives The governments ability to conduct openmarket operations can help it control the impact of external capital inflows The Chinese government appears to be drafting debtmarket regulations that will allow the listing of more corporate bonds firms to use the proceeds as they see fit and new debt products But many other issues need to be addressed before the debt market can take off First an environment of commercial trust and a system for contract enforcement and liquidation must be established Second a comprehensive and reliable creditrating system is needed Some mainland Chinese rating agencies are pressured to make positive evaluations When rating agencies are reliable investors can better gauge whether a company will repay Third a benchmark rate and yield curve must be established Currently the benchmark couponrate on debt is a oneyear deposit rate of but this is not entirely appropriate The coupon rate is for example on a fiveyear treasury bond for a threeyear treasury bond and capped on the former at This provides little scope for corporates to price new issues attractively The average yield of listedcorporate debts is already or for maturity of more than five years Moreover debt markets need to merge At present trading occurs at exchanges or between banks Since trading volume is small and liquidity low prices face distortion The trading volume of enterprise bonds for example is just of treasury bonds Finally there is need for a wider range of debt products for example floatingrate bonds as opposed to simply fixedrate debt instruments As it stands now there only about types of corporate debts Most are zerocoupon bonds one is floating The development of derivative products would provide another important impetus to growth of the capital markets Mainlanders have few financial products to choose from just plus listed stocks and a handful of corporate bonds and closedend funds China does have some futures exchanges but trading is limited to a few commodities like soybeans wheat and copper The trading of derivatives would enhance economic efficiency First they enable investors and underwriters to hedge their positions and lock in profits Second derivatives temper stockprice volatility by reducing the concentration of money in one market Once an index derivative market is established variance between two markets can prompt arbitrage opportunities Derivatives also enable better risk management attracting more capital to the stock markets especially risksensitive pension insurance and offshore funds However the value of mature capital markets goes beyond capitalization Full fledged they can force enterprises to compete for funds weeding out the weak from the strong Last month the China Securities Regulatory Commission delisted washingmachine maker Narcissus from the Shanghai Stock Exchange after the company racked up four consecutive years of losses The rules for stripping companies of their listing had been murky but the CSRC assertively clarified them in February saying firms posting three or more years of losses would be given just six months to make a profit or face delisting Narcissus soon came back with a turnaround plan but the Shanghai exchange rejected it claiming the proposal was unworkable Thats just one example of an array of reforms regulators are pressing ahead with to bring Chinas capital markets in line with the survivalofthefittest ethos that characterizes their more mature counterparts elsewhere Mr Pu is senior economist at

at Hearing Question Need For Hedging Regulations Standard BNA Towards one interest rate Business Standard Credit protection costs down after Fed cut Reuters Argentine bond swap seeks to calm fears of debt default Financial Times ISDA Unveils New Margin Accord For Collateral Process Dow Jones May By Joe Niedzielski NEW YORK Dow Jones The International Swaps and Derivatives Association said Wednesday that it has published new documentation on margin provisions The document known as the ISDA margin provisions updates and simplifies ISDAS four existing credit support documents in a single document ISDA said Wednesday in a press release The document is easy to understand and will reduce the barriers to entry for new derivatives market participants Robert Pickel ISDAs executive director and CEO said in the release In many areas of the overthecounter derivatives market financial institutions and other end users of derivatives such as corporations and fund managers reduce credit exposure by posting cash collateral But unlike the highlyliquid and standardized US government securities repurchase market where the transfer of collateral is generally initiated by the close of business following a morning margin call a derivatives counterparty may have to wait as long as days to two weeks before being able to liquidate ISDAs new document though includes steppedup timing standards for collateral calls The provisions have common operational provisions incorporate a plain English approach and offer more streamlined timing and disputeresolution procedures ISDA said Parties using the provisions can select jurisdictionspecific provisions to apply to their margin arrangements under New York English and Japanese law ISDA said The ISDA margin provisions documentation project was partially a response to bouts of market turmoil in recent years Several disputes have arisen between market participants in the wake of s liquidity seizure and flighttoquality following Russias debt default and the near demise of Long Term Capital Management the heavilyleveraged hedge fund The provisions were a response to market disruptions in recent years and offer a mechanism to reduce credit exposure arising between the time of a trade and the time at which an institution can liquidate any available collateral said David Maloy managing director of global collateral and margin at UBS Warburg and a cochair of the ISDA collateral committee For institutions that want to amend their existing credit support annexes rather than opt for the new margin provisions amendment forms to the New York law and English law credit support annexes will be available in June ISDA said ISDA said those forms will mirror the operative sections of the provisions with respect to transfer timing dispute resolution and substitutions or exchange of margin IRS Officials at Hearing Question Need For Hedging Regulations Standard BNA May By Alison Bennett Internal Revenue Service and Treasury officials May sharply questioned witnesses on why they should broaden the risk standard used to define hedging transactions in proposed rules REG that have drawn criticism from the practitioner community Nearly every hearing witness said the proposed rules do not go far enough in implementing a new standard for hedging enacted under the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of Pub L No That law changed the standard for qualifying hedging transactions from one focusing on risk reduction transactions to one centered around risk management transactions Witnesses complained that the proposed rules DTR G L retained too great a focus on risk reduction as a way to assess whether favorable hedging treatment should be allowed The rules represent a serious and inappropriate failure to live up to congressional standards said Andrea Kramer of McDermott Will Emery in Chicago I find it inconceivable that anybody could argue that the tax act did not result in a farreaching and substantive change to the meaning of hedging transactions Kramer said Questions From IRS She was questioned closely by JoLynn Ricks an IRS attorneyadviser on financial institutions and products about why the government should broaden the standard to go beyond the position taken by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on hedging in which focused on risk reduction Kramer contended that Financial Accounting Standard No which was amended last June DTR G is not relevant to tax questions surrounding the hedging of derivatives The financial accounting rules for derivatives and hedging transactions are fundamentally different from the tax rules Kramer said I would argue that FAS is not significant here In addition to urging the government to replace all mention of risk reduction in the final rules with the standard of risk management both Kramer and Earl Goldhammer of American Electric Power asked for favorable treatment for certain transactions by commodities dealers Commodities Proposal Under the proposal raised by both witnesses qualifying transactions would relate to a derivative valued in reference to a commodity also handled by the dealer fall within preapproved controls on speculation set out in formally adopted risk management policies and not be identified by the commodities dealer as having been entered into in its dealer capacity We would like to know that if a trader trades within preapproved limits and if you have a risk management program that is not a phony program that that is legitimate Goldhammer said Although Goldhammer was identified on an IRS hearing document as working for Americas Energy Partners DTR G TaxCore he told IRS officials that is merely his companys slogan Salomon Smith Barney Tax Director Mark Perwien representing the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc in New York also criticized the references to risk reduction found under the proposed rules Its very important for a company to be able to manage its price and all of its other risks in a way that is consistent with how it sees the marketplace Perwien told the government panel The ISDA representative acknowledged that obviously IRS is concerned about being whipsawed but said protections such as sameday identification of derivatives already exist He stressed that to properly implement congressional intent the final rules should apply to all transactions undertaken in the ordinary course of business that alter the taxpayers exposure to one or more of the risks inherent in the taxpayers core economic activities In addition he said favorable hedging treatment should be available for weather and energy supply derivatives IRS also should permit hedges of dividend streams overall profitability and other business risks that do not relate directly to interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations Periwen told the government Gap Hedges Raised Testifying on behalf of the American Council of Life Insurers Washington DC Frank Gould of Prudential Life Insurance Co urged IRS and Treasury to provide favorable treatment of gap hedging of derivatives by his industry IRS field agents are routinely concluding that gap hedges are not good tax hedgestheyre consistently saying theyre hedges of capital assets Gould said Gap hedging isnt about a particular asset or group of assets he said Its about maintaining balance between assets and liabilities Its an integral part of how we run our business Peter Carlisle of Baker McKenzie Washington DC and his colleague Jeff Wallace both said the IRS definition of risk management is inappropriately restrictive Wallace said that because companies approach hedging in different ways it would be appropriate for IRS to be more flexible in what it considers qualifying risk management activities Split Approach to Hedging For example he said some companies take a macroeconomic approach to hedging in which the entire enterprise faces economic risk while others take a microeconomic or transactionbytransaction approach to these risks Enterprise risk reduction is a nebulous concept which is really not practicable for taxpayers who manage their risk on a microeconomic level Wallace said Ricks asked if IRS should consider an approach which would allow taxpayers to do both macroeconomic and microeconomic hedging as long as they identify which type they are doing and allow that to control treatment of the transaction Both Carlisle and Wallace said they would heartily endorse such an approach The government panel included two other officials from IRS financial institutions and products special counsel Richard Carlisle and branch chief Alvin Kraft Also on the panel were Viva Hammer a Treasury attorneyadviser and Robert Hanson Treasury deputy tax legislative counsel for regulatory affairs The transcript of the hearing will be in BNA TaxCore Towards one interest rate Business Standard May Janaki Krishnan The introduction of options and futures to replace the timetested badla system effective July will align interest rates in the money and equity markets leading to a more effective monetary transmission mechanism At a macro level the significance of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Sebi decision to ban badla and all deferral products and have only a cash and a derivatives market marks the integration of the equity and money markets This means the RBIs interest rate signals will be absorbed faster in the wider financial system Currently as Shekhar Sathe CEO of Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund says there are varying badla rates on each of the scrips eligible for carry forward It is like having interest rates in the system he says Badla rates are derived as the sum of an equity risk premium on that particular scrip over and above the interest rate component In effect since the equity risk component varies from week to week and differently in different scrips it masks the cost of money Thus badla for scrip X may be per cent but for scrip Y it may be only per cent The financial sector is sharply divided between the banking and the equities sector All this is set to change with the introduction of derivatives At a simplified level since operators can take a position on the spot and futures markets at the same time the cost of money is already factored into the derivative prices This reflects the opportunity cost of taking a forward position Thus an operator who buys in spot and short sells in the futures market is actually putting up cash now in return for future gains Since this involves a cash outlay the operator will at least expect his returns to cover the interest costs for the period of the contract Derivatives pricing thus incorporates the cost of money Says Sebi board member J R Varma The system will eventually lead to a convergence of interest rates throughout the system Market sources said though the extent of banks involvement in the revised trading systems will only be clarified later there were tremendous opportunities for banks to take proprietary positions in the derivative markets For instance banks could play a leading role in the developments of calendar spreads which are basically forwardtoforward contracts in the foreign exchange markets Thus a bank may buy a onemonth contract and sell a sixmonth contract Since the price of the latter will be more than that of the onemonth contract the bank will make a net spread But since the market rates of interest will smoothen out over all markets this spread will typically reflect the difference between onemonth and sixmonth money Arbitrage opportunities like this will lead to a uniformity of interest rates Varma said Money market dealers welcomed the move saying that equities as an asset class are a welcome addition to the limited deployment options before banks Acknowledging that not all banks will be comfortable with dealing in the equity derivatives markets one dealer says As long as one bank is comfortable arbitraging between the money and equity markets the rates will align as this bank can borrow in call and deploy the funds in derivative spreads If the call money rates are higher this bank can do a reverse arbitrage The second implication is that equity prices in the spot markets will respond quicker to interest rate changes Currently lower interest rates will to lower interest costs for companies in the coming years thereby boosting its net profits This reflects in optimism on the equity price front after interest rates are cut But with a derivatives market a rate cut will immediately impact derivative prices and arbitrageurs will ensure that this is immediately transmitted to spot equity prices too Much like in the US we are looking at a situation where money market rates will determine the valuations of a wide spectrum of asset classes and not just gilts the chief dealer of a private bank says This will lead to a much more responsive financial system he adds Credit protection costs down after Fed cut Reuters May By Tom Burroughes LONDON May Reuters The cost of credit protection declined across most sectors in the default swap market on Wednesday after the US Federal Reserves rate cut but prices on two firms debt rose due to planned new issuance dealers said Credit default swaps narrowed around two to three basis points for automakers and telecoms continuing a trend of recent weeks and further encouraged by the Feds basis point easing on Tuesday said a dealer for a European bank in London Default swaps are insurance type instruments which allow investors to adjust their exposure to the risk of default or other event on a bond or loan They compose the most liquid part of the present credit derivative market Spreads in the cash and default swap market are both two to three basis points tighter in general the dealer said In telecoms fiveyear default swaps on British Telecom were cited at about two basis points tighter Deutsche Telekom were two basis points in at and France Telecom slightly narrower at the dealer said In the car sector the dealer said protection on DaimlerChrysler has fallen about two basis points to Another trader at a European bank said French carmaker Peugeot traded at three bps down from the start of the week In banks activity was quiet but default swaps were a touch tighter Deutsche Bank senior debt was cited at a bidoffer spread of In industrials default swaps inched down on firms such as French glassmaker St Gobain which declined to a bidoffer spread of down around four basis points from Monday a dealer said DEFYING THE TREND Credit protection costs rose on a couple of firms to buck the general trend Fiveyear default swaps on the Swedish mobile phone company Ericsson rose basis points to from Tuesday when bankers announced the firm was to issue billion euros of fiveyear and million sterling of sevenyear bonds Another Scandanavian firm in play was the FinnishSwedish forest industry group Stora Enso which is to issue a dollardenominated global bond Fiveyear default swaps have widened about basis points to since the announcement last week said a dealer for a European bank MOSTLY ONE WAY Default swaps were grinding lower on most names in part because of synthetic credit portfolio deals which means players who are short credit risk are hedging their positions by selling default swaps The growth of the synthetic portfolio market has been pressing down credit protection prices recently A synthetic portfolio replicates portfolios of bonds by selling default swaps on various names To change this trend players may need to believe the interest rate outlook is changing or fresh debt supply is in the pipeline said one dealer for a European bank in London We need some issuance and a view that rates have bottomed out he said Argentine bond swap seeks to calm fears of debt default Financial Times May By Peter Hudson Thomas Catan David Mulford the US banker who has played a leading role in putting together Argentinas massive bond swap on Wednesday defended the deal saying it represented a new marketled approach to tackling sovereign debt crises The deal which seeks to exchange nearterm bonds for longer dated paper is seen as crucial to calming fears that Argentina could default on its bn debt Investors are anxiously awaiting terms of the transaction which Mr Mulford a former US Treasury undersecretary with connections to Domingo Cavallo Argentine economy minister said could be launched as early as next week Speaking in Buenos Aires on Wednesday Mr Mulford international chairman at Credit Suisse First Boston said the deal would be easily the largest of its kind and could resolve Argentinas financing problems without the need for additional aid from financial institutions The International Monetary Fund helped assemble a package of aid worth nearly bn in December Although he declined to discuss details of the swap citing Securities and Exchange Commission regulations Mr Mulford described it as essential to longterm success in restoring Argentine growth He added that the operation would imply a substantial reduction in debt payments over the next three to four years If the deal was a success he said its size will effectively change the Argentine debt market and market perception According to bankers the transaction could save Argentina bnbn in debt servicing costs before giving it time to resume growth and bring its debt burden under control Argentinas benchmark FRB bond surged l points on Wednesday after the Argentine president Fernando de la Rua signed a decree authorising the deal Argentina has been mired in recession for nearly three years raising doubts about its ability to keep servicing foreign debt That prospect has caused alarm because the country accounts for almost a quarter of tradeable emerging market debt Although the overall size of the debt is comparable to that of other emerging markets Mr Mulford said concerns about its shortterm structure meant that unless that is addressed it is doubtful world markets will really support growth in Argentina The countrys interest rates are at a very high level as a result of investor uncertainty But Mr Mulford rejected suggestions that Argentina should await lower rates before launching the deal Its essential to do this deal now he said End of ISDA Press

Brokers will respond once they smell money Business Standard Tax dues mar brokers foray into derivatives Business Standard New attack on proposal to allow advertising by hedge funds Financial Times Proposed Rule Would Ease Transition Of SECRegistered Firms to CFTC Oversight BNA May The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC proposed new rules May that would relax the registration requirements of Securities and Exchange Commissionregistered brokerdealers wishing to cross over and trade security futures products In a May Federal Register notice the futures regulatory agency said it wants to amend its rules so that such broker dealers can seek CFTC registration by notice filing Fed Reg Currently all potential futures commission merchants FCMs and introducing brokers as traders of commodities and futures are categorized must file at least two registration forms with the CFTC CEA Revised When Congress revised the Commodity Exchange Act CEA in December it allowed single stock futures and futures on certain narrowbased stock indices for the first time in nearly years Such instrumentssecurity futuresare expected to be offered by firms that do not typically conduct transactions in futures products creating a regulatory dilemma The proposed new rule would allow any brokerdealer that limits its futures activity to security futures products and that is in good standing with the SEC to become registered with the CFTC with the submission of notice In this case notice would likely be filed with the National Futures Association the CFTC said The commission also proposed a rule that would allow such registrants to avoid the requirement that all FCMs be members of a registered futures association Though it is operating under a voluntary moratorium on new rules requested by the White House the CFTC has received permission from the Office of Management and Budget to propose rules that arose out of Congresss sweeping reform package known as the Commodity Futures Modernization Act which passed in December The moratorium which was extended to all government entities under interim leadership back in January is expected to be in place until someone is named to chair the commission permanently Brokers will respond once they smell money Business Standard May By Janaki Krishnan and Tamal Bandopadhyay Once a staunch supporter of badla Securities and Exchange Board of India Sebi board member J R Varma has in the recent past been a strong proponent of replacing the product with derivatives Two days after the capital market watchdog rang the death knell for badla and ushered in derivatives trading in a big way a relaxed Varma justified his stand to Janaki Krishnan and Tamal Bandopadhyay Carryforward has lost its historic relevance If instead of a complex product that does many things hedging speculation finance we have products that do different things but do them better I think it is preferable to make the transition Extracts Q Will the migration from carry forward to the derivatives market be easy Will it be painless A No I would be untruthful to myself if I say that that the transition will be painless There will surely be pain as a system migrates from the familiarity of badla to the complexities of derivatives trading But at the end of the day you have to see whether it is a pain worth taking To my mind this is certainly the case The Indian equities market has to move up to better products even if it means some shortterm adjustment pains Q Do you think volumes will dry up A Certainly not It will be fairly liquid and vibrant There may be a drop in volumes at the initial stage but in six to eight months I expect the markets to revive to their normal levels of activity Q The Sebi had introduced index futures in June last year What has been the experience so far A Ever since index futures were introduced in June last year there has been a slow but steady growth The trading volumes are growing every month Last July was better than June and so it continued In February the average daily trading was worth around Rs crore So it is very clear that the product index futures fills in some perceived need in the market for such a product Otherwise such products die a very quick death The increasing volumes also tell us that it is attracting new adherents by the day which means those who started early have stayed on and their experiences are helping new players to come into the market In that sense I am satisfied But mind you this is growth on a low base We still have a long way to go It has been the global experience that the derivatives markets take off slowly Typically you have to give it oneandahalf to two years to reach critical mass If the Indian markets do not show signs of growth in the next six to seven months after taking into account the one year in which index futures has been around then we have a problem In our case the experience is not terribly bad but certainly not as good as one would have expected Q What is the level of preparedness of the market participants A The stock exchanges are by and large prepared They have already been trading in index futures and hopefully their software and systems are in place Coming to brokers I think they have to make an effort to set their back offices and trading strategies in order But I am very optimistic that the brokers will respond to the new regime enthusiastically once they smell money in terms of trading opportunities Well it is a challenge since the margining system is much more complex and the methodology of computing margins is not a straight calculation In fact the challenge is in getting the margins right Q Do you think the ordinary investor will embrace the new system or will he be marginalised A I pin my highest hopes on the Indian investor who has shown a great capacity to learn Everyone is on the learning curve but once the average investor realises the benefits of the new system he is sure to take the plunge Q The big question remains earlier you were a badla supporter why have you changed your stance A Laughs Well yes I was a strong badla supporter when badla was banned in In fact I was among the few who protested the badla ban then My point was simple how can you take away whatever rudimentary instruments investors have to hedge themselves against risk And if you have a theoretical problem with badla you must have a better system to replace it with In we didnt have an alternative I had written a paper in where I argued that badla was meeting a whole lot of requirements in the system For instance if you remember that was the time when all shares were in paper form So if a guy had sent shares for transfer which often took two months or more then he couldnt sell in the interim period Badla gave him the opportunity to exit by selling first and postponing delivery till such time as he got the shares to deliver Badla was a hedging mechanism that doubled up as a tool for speculation It was the only way to have short sales in the system which is the ultimate bulwark against the bullish price manipulation of shares And it was the only means of getting finance into the equity markets So there were three or four very obvious functions that badla was doing If you look at the scenario now demat has removed the issue of delays in getting shares transferredso on the stock lending scheme has replaced badla as the preferred option to get shares to make deliveries in case of short sales Badla has lost its relevance now Q But do derivatives fill in all the market requirements A Please understand that there are lots of specific products that have been introduced in the system over the last decade that fulfill each of these requirements individually So instead of a complex system which served all purposes in a suboptimal manner now we have an array of specialised products that deliver specific services and do it better In derivatives we have a world class hedging tool now available to Indian investors Q You said that globally the derivatives markets take two years to develop fully How much time do you give yourself for the Indian derivatives market to reach critical mass A I would give it six to nine months By early I expect average daily volumes of Rs crore Q What will be the role of banks in the new system A Of course banks will continue to be the fulcrum of the new system too We will need to have clearing banks that settle the cash part of the transactions Plus there will be a whole new vista of opportunities for banks in the derivatives markets For instance banks can do calendar spreads as yet another method of parking their surplus funds and earning returns Calendar spreads are nothing but simple contracts where banks buy an option for a near period say June and sell it for a longer period say September It is like a forwardtoforward contract in the foreign exchange markets and banks can get positive returns In the long run this can be a huge market like the overnight call money market where banks can park their shortterm funds Q Do you think financing will be an issue in the markets when badla financiers are thrown out of the new system A It is not true that badla financiers will be removed from the system It is just their methods of operations will change They can arbitrage between the cash market and derivatives markets and even within the derivatives market By deploying their funds between different parts of the market they will not only impart depth to the markets but will also make a decent return on their funds Q The way you put it is the system going to be a level playing field for foreign institutional investor mutual funds and large players In the badla system these players for instance were prohibited from short selling A I think it is a level playing field for everyone though I have received some queries whether FIIs will also be allowed to short sell We are negotiating with RBI Q What is the issue with FIIs A There is no issue It is just that the RBI had mandated that FIIs can only buy derivative contracts to hedge against an underlying position So if an FII had a purchase position in the spot market it could short sell in futures but not a naked short sale Maybe there is a policy issue somewhere but we are in dialogue with the central bank and hope to resolve the issue Tax dues

segment will have to first clear their turnover tax dues to the market regulator Brokers are upset with the decision and feel that this would deter the growth of the derivatives market as the tax would mean an additional burden on them and substantially reduce the interest in the segment which needs to grow fast According to rough estimates the aggregate dues of the broking firms to Sebi as outstanding tax on turnover is about Rs crore The amount due from individual brokers varies from few lakh to several crores The brokers had moved court disputing the Sebis claim but they lost their case in the Supreme Court in February this year after a protracted legal battle In addition to the dues to be cleared brokers would have to pay the standard registration fee which even for a trading member is about Rs lakh and for the software Sebi has also mandated that all broking firms seeking registration for the derivative segment must have at least two experts in derivatives trading with a NCFM NSE Certification for Financial Markets certificate Sebi full time board member Jayanth R Varma said It is untenable that the brokers will be offered registration for a new segment without clearing their dues Besides when the apex court has upheld Sebis claims the brokers cannot get away without paying it Speaking on the various nuances of the derivatives segment Varma said in the beginning the derivatives segment would be cashsettled implying that the difference between the strike price and reigning market price would be paid to the gainer and securities would not be delivered We will follow the American model in individual stock options and the European model in index options Varma said In the American model one can exercise the option at any point during the entire life of the option while in the European model the right to exercise the option is restricted within a specific time frame Varma also said it would take the market regulator a couple of meetings to finetune the risk management system for the segment Varma added in the next board meetings Sebi would discuss whether smaller exchanges like Calcutta Stock Exchange would be allowed to start their own derivatives segment New attack on proposal to allow advertising by hedge funds Financial Times May By JOHN AUTHERS The Investment Company Institute the trade association for the US mutual fund industry started its annual meeting in Washington yesterday with a renewed attack on proposals to allow hedge funds to advertise Matthew Fink the institutes president said hedge fund advertising could create serious and unnecessary risks to public confidence in the industry Hedge funds should accept greater regulation if they wanted to open themselves to the general public he said If parallel industries are permitted to develop one regulated one unregulated the only direction we are destined to move in is a race to the bottom as competitive forces pressure all firms to minimise regulatory costs The Managed Funds Association which represents hedge funds wants relaxation of the rules against advertising but says it does not want to compete for retail investors The institute also took the opportunity to respond to the widespread belief that mutual fund flows make the market more volatile This followed an outflow of Dollars bn from equity mutual funds in March the highest monthly outflow on record This appears to have been followed by a heavy inflow in April Terry Glenn chairman of Merrill Lynch funds and chairman of the Institute denied there was any sign of panic from mutual fund investors during the early months of this year Panic is not a word one would associate with our investors Shareholders are not insensitive to stock price movements but their response to market movements tends to be spread over time Mr Glenn added that fund investors have never responded to sharp market falls by redeeming shares en masse in any period since the war There is no evidence that this longestablished pattern of behaviour will change he said End of ISDA Press Report for May THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF ISDAS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

May By Colin Cameron and Deborah Hargreaves Leading European and US banks want more information on how new rules on capital adequacy will operate raising the possibility that final proposals from the Basle committee could be delayed In a letter to William McDonough chairman of the Basle committee of international financial regulators banks yesterday asked for more detailed information on seven key areas The letter was signed by heads of the US European and Japanese banking associations We are keen to implement the new accord in but we see no absolute reason why the endoftheyear timetable has to be kept said Maurizio Sella president of the European Banking Federation Its much better to get out a proposal thats right even if it is a few months late The committee published its latest draft of the proposed Basle accord in January and set a deadline for consultation with the industry to be completed by the end of May But many financial operators believe this is now unrealistic The banking associations are asking for detailed papers to be sent to them by August so that they could respond by October The Basle committee has bitten off more than it can chew said Ian Linnell banking analyst at credit rating agency Fitch The accord in its draft form is incredibly aggressive and a contains a number of black holes that require further work Banks want detailed papers on the treatment of retail equity and project finance portfolios They are also asking for more information on the way operational risk unexpected losses will be treated and for details on aspects of securitisation counterparty risk and disclosure The letter points out that in a number of important areas the Basle committees second consultation document has either come up with new proposals or indicated that final proposals are to come Taken together these greener areas will have a critical impact on the outcome of the proposals for individual firms and the industry as a whole the letter says The banks are particularly concerned about the levels of capital that would have to be carried by some institutions to cover operational risk The misapplication of the operational risk charge could cause serious distortions in competition between institutions Mr Sella said They are also worried about the calculation of the level of capital banks must hold which in an economic downturn could lead to a credit crunch We have been assured the level of capital in the system will not increase We are very concerned that if the calibration is not done properly that will go up and it could have a serious effect on the economy the European banking federation said The Basle committee last night welcomed the banks feedback but expressed confidence that the yearend timetable would be maintained KfW seeks Basle II changes IFR May Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau KfW Germanys largest promotional bank intends to bring four items into the discussion surrounding the revised Basle Capital Accord Basle II Hans Reich the agencys managing board chairman said that modifications were necessary to ensure the supply of credit to small and mediumsized enterprises in the future In particular KfW wants the customary collateral categories to be recognised equally and fully in all risk rating approaches It also wants Basle II to allow small loans such as those to small businesses to be combined into socalled retail portfolios in all ratings approaches Referring to the advanced IRB approach and the Basle II papers requirement of higher equity being held for loans with long maturity KfW considers this to be a discrimination against the customary longterm lending relations that are long established in the German banking system KfW also considers the Basle II proposals on the subject of securitisation to be unclear It argues that care needs to be taken to ensure that the new requirements do not run counter to those of SME loans securitisation which reduce the risk for banks Reich expressed satisfaction at his firms intensive and constructive talks with the German finance ministry on these points We are pleased that our politicians are dealing so intensively with the topic of SME finance and the necessary changes required by Basle II he said Creditors Must Better Measure Hedge Fund Exposures BIS Dow Jones May By Tyler Lifton NEW YORK Dow Jones While good progress is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk management and regulatory oversight of highly leveraged institutions HLI credit providers need to make further improvements in the measurement of credit exposures a global banking watchdog said Friday Disclosure of information by HLIs to banks and other credit providers has improved in terms of both quality and quantity nonetheless progress remains inconsistent with confidentiality concerns and competitive pressures sometimes limiting information flows according to a press release from the Bank For International Settlements HLI is a description generally reserved for hedge funds and other investment vehicles that use leverage or borrowing as a fundamental strategic tool The press release outlined a report by the Financial Stability Forum which works to promote international financial stability and is affiliated with the Basel Switzerlandbased BIS on progress made toward implementing recommendations it has endorsed Supervisors remain concerned about the ability of regulated firms to resist market pressures in particular on initial margin according to the release Although a separate study that looks to set out a basis for improvements in public disclosure of financial risks has been completed actual progress toward introducing mandatory public disclosure requirements for HLIs and hedge funds has been limited the FSF report said At the same time improvements have been made by senior management in terms of reporting on HLI exposures general standards of credit analysis due diligence and documentation the FSF reported And foreign exchange market participants have agreed to a set of socalled Good Practice Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Trading This would help address concerns that large and concentrated HLI positions could have the potential to materially influence market dynamics in small and mediumsized open economies according to the FSF report While progress is being made in addressing weaknesses in legal documentation practices it has proven difficult to achieve improvements in the consistency where appropriate between different industry standards the report added Legal documentation underlying financial contracts is a crucial building block in the stability of the financial system the FSF said Banks warned on exposure Financial Times May By Dow Jones Agency Material Banks warned on exposure The Bank for International Settlements believes that banks are still not doing enough to monitor their exposure to hedge funds The central banks central bank set up a group to study the systemic risk posed by hedge funds after LongTerm Capital Managements collapse in So far it is only partially satisfied While good progress is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk management and regulatory oversight of socalled highly leveraged institutions HLIs credit providers need to make further improvements in the measurement of credit exposures the global banking watchdog said Disclosure of information by HLIs to banks and other credit providers has improved in terms of both quality and quantity the Bank for International Settlements said last week Nonetheless progress remains inconsistent with confidentiality concerns and competitive pressures sometimes limiting information flows it said HLI is a description generally reserved for hedge funds and other investment vehicles that use leverage or borrowing as a fundamental strategic tool BIS outlined a report by the Financial Stability Forum which works to promote international financial stability on progress made in the area Supervisors remain concerned about the ability of regulated firms to resist market pressures in particular on initial margin BIS said Banks say bill too tough on disclosure South China Morning Post May By Enoch Yiu Nine investment banks have voiced opposition to the proposed Securities and Futures Bill saying the proposals for derivative trading disclosure are tougher than elsewhere in the world They have asked the Government to amend the bill to exclude disclosure on some derivatives and ensure the disclosure regime reflected more closely the existing laws in Hong Kong and other markets The banks said they feared the legislation would discourage international investors from trading in Hong Kong shares undermining the SARs position as an international market The investment banks involved are Credit Suisse First Boston Deutsche Bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein Goldman Sachs Asia J P Morgan Merrill Lynch Asia Pacific Morgan Stanley Asia Salomon Smith Barney Hong Kong and UBS Warburg They are concerned about disclosure on socalled cashsettled derivatives Under existing law the banks need make no disclosure However they will need to do so under the new law as it expands the disclosure requirement from shares to include derivatives In a paper submitted by their law firm Linklaters to legislators yesterday the group of banks warned the bill would impose a stricter disclosure regulation on the local financial market than on those of overseas competitors But the Government rejected this saying the smaller local market would require tougher restrictions to avoid market manipulation The Governments refusal to make changes could endanger the implementation of the bill It has already been delayed from July to the yearend because legislators feared a rush to pass the bill would repeat the mess of the copyright law The Securities and Futures Bill when it becomes law replaces all existing securities ordinance and adds new regulations on Internet trading It will also tighten securities business in banks and make insider dealing a criminal offence The banks said the main reason the bill was tougher than those of its overseas competitors was that it required anyone to disclose interests in shares which had not yet been issued referring to newly issued shares held if options were exercised Also it required disclosure of their interests in listed companies arising under cashsettled derivatives In addition it required banks to report on short positions However the government refused to make any alterations Locally listed companies are smaller than their overseas counterparts making it easier for them to be manipulated by speculators said Au Kingchi Deputy Secretary for Financial Services The stricter disclosure requirement in the bill compared with international practices would be needed for Hong Kong to reduce manipulation activities she said Ms Au said the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce supported the bill to require disclosure in the derivative markets The government will not just hear the opinions of the large investment banks but we also need to listen to the ideas of the listed companies and the local investors who have demanded more transparency The Pan Asian Securities Lending Association a group of companies which conduct stock lending and borrowing activities also complained that the bill was too tough Its concern is that the bill is drafted too widely resulting in lender agents being required to make the disclosure None of the other global financial markets that have a formal securities lending market treat securities lending as a disclosable event the association said in a paper given to legislators yesterday US bankruptcy bill aids derivatives Risk May By Alexandra Ness A US bankruptcy bill now in the last stages of congressional approval contains crossproduct netting provisions that should enhance the legal status of credit equity and weather derivatives The hill updates the USs yearold netting laws which have been outstripped by the rapid development of new types of overthecounter derivatives markets Updating the netting provisions to include a wider range of OTC products has been a priority for the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and the Bond Market Association BMA since the mids In two highprofile reports in by the Presidents Working Group one on LongTerm Capital Management and one on OTC derivatives regulation US regulators acknowledged that updating the netting law would reduce systemic risk Even so Congress and the Bush administration do not see quick passage of the bill as particularly urgent and observers estimate it may take until the third quarter for it to become law Crossnetting or mutual offset of obligations and liabilities is standard for many transactions including swaps under current US law The definition of swaps has been stretched to cover forward rate agreements forward foreign exchange contracts and other instruments But the current law does not include equity and credit derivative contracts in its definition of swaps They fall under the nebulous term other similar agreements in the code The current crossnetting provisions for derivatives were passed under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act FDICJA in and are reflected in ISDAs master agreements Since the passage of the FDICIA legislation the derivatives market has grown significantly Friction developed between the swaps and securities contracts with regard to netting across them says Dan Cunningham a partner at Allen Overy in New York and ISDAs legal counsel ISDA and the BMA have worked on this issue since Nearly all the provisions requested by them have been included in the legislation The House of Representatives and Senate versions of the bill are currently being reconciled and there is little doubt that the netting provisions will be included in the bill eventually sent to President Bush for his signature Among these provisions is the expanded definition of a swap agreement At present swap agreements do not encompass any security agreements credit enhancements guarantees or reimbursement obligations related to swap agreements By eliminating the nonspecific phrase other similar agreements and expanding the definition of swap agreements to include equity credit and weather derivatives the new provisions allow for nearly all swap related securities contracts to have the right of transfer and setoff Currently security arrangements not specifically defined as swap agreements are rejected as unqualified transfers and not netted This bill will provide substantial legal certainties regarding securities lending and will promote liquidity says Seth Grosshandler partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen Hamilton an adviser to the BMA in bankruptcy legislation Contracts will have expanded collateral and an array of products to provide for safe harbour Netting and settlement will be much faster and more efficient under the new bill he adds One area the new hill does not address his crossaffiliate netting All provisions in the bill pertain to bilateral netting Provisions for crossaffiliate netting were deemed too complex to be included The I BMA is expected to propose an addition to the bankruptcy provisions to deal with crossaffiliate netting in the third or fourth I quarter of this year U Securities Trade Groups Argue Against Firms Liability To Sophisticated Investors for Certain Trades BNA May The Bond Market Association Futures Industry Association and Foreign Exchange Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York told the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit May that sophisticated investors should not be permitted to sue financial institutions for carrying out their nondiscretionary transactions in the credit markets BMA said that day de Kwiatkowski v Bear Stearns Co d Cir No In an amicus curiae brief the groups urged that allowing such suits would only lead to a heads I win tails I sue liability framework that would undermine the integrity and efficiency of the financial markets BMA said in a news release This is a critically important case for the fixedincome industry BMA General Counsel Paul Saltzman said in the release If the appeals court upholds the legal reasoning underlying the district courts decision counterparties will want juries to second guess every good faith action of financial institutions and seek reimbursement for every losing trade he predicted The organizations sought the overturn of a decision rendered late last year in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York Henryk deKwiatkowski a wealthy Canadian investor had engaged in a series of currency futures contracts and currency forward contracts that were purchased on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the overthecounter markets The contracts were carried out by Bear Stearns Co as a futures commission merchant FCM and as principal BMA recounted Responsibility With Customer The district court decided that special circumstances supported a jury verdict for Kwiatkowski and against Bear Stearns However the brief argued that the responsibility for trading decisions in nondiscretionary accounts rests with the customer and precluded liability in this instance for Bear Stearns Customers who suffer market losses should not be able to effect an end run around the carefully defined limitations on the duties of a broker by alleging violations of some general duty of care the groups wrote The three groups contended that because a wide range of factors can affect the market price of a futures contract the imposition of any continuing duty to furnish all price information and information of all facts likely to affect the market price would be so burdensome as to be unreasonable In this case they said deKwiatkowskis financial losses were brought about by market factors De Kwiatkowski speculated that the dollar would appreciateand he would have profited handsomely if it hadbut the Mexican debt crisis intervened the dollar fell and he incurred losses the brief said Those are the only special circumstances of this caseyet they are precisely the sort of circumstances that participants face in these markets day in and day out it said Reliance on Contracts Because of the need for legal certainty the credit markets must rely heavily on contracts to permit market intermediaries and their customers and counterparties to identify the precise nature of the products services or functions being purchased the brief observed Market participants need to be able to expect that other participants will be held to their contractual allocations of risk for the markets to perform effectively and efficiently especially in the futures and OTC derivatives markets where risk of loss inheres in every trade the three organizations urged The absence of certainty introduces risk which can hurt market efficiency liquidity and costs By disregarding precedents and New York law the district courts opinion runs counter to the legal certainty the markets require the brief said The district court in effect created a broad new malpractice cause of action against brokers regarding the handling of accountswhich is plainly at odds with New York law the brief maintained The narrow scope of a brokers duty to a nondiscretionary account under New York law applies fully to a futures broker the groups wrote Under longstanding legal precedent the duty owed by a futures broker to a nondiscretionary account is an exceedingly narrow one relating to properly carrying out transactions ordered by the customer the brief noted Dealers have similarly narrow responsibilities it argued Market intermediaries may agree to perform additional services such as discretionary trading and investment advisory services but in the absence of an explicit agreement the risk of the venture is upon the customer who profits if it succeeds and loses if it fails the brief summed up The limits of ingenuity Financial Times May Is the pace of financial innovation slowing To pose the question when global financial markets appear trapped in a perpetual maelstrom may seem quixotic Yet the markets in swaps options futures and other derivative instruments that emerged from the economic upheavals of the s are now relatively mature Innovative dynamism is less evident That fact in no way belies the radical nature of the changes of the past quartercentury The balance of the global financial system has tilted away from conventional tasks raising capital and matching the needs of savers and borrowers towards the management of risk According to Alfred Steinherr chief economist of the European Investment Bank the impact bears comparison with the creation of stock exchanges in previous centuries Some even argue that this financial revolution will become selfsustaining generating constant improvements in economic efficiency But what will drive that innovation in future The late Merton Miller Nobel Prize winner and supporter of derivatives markets emphasised the facilitating role of new technology and the desire to mitigate the costs of regulation and taxation That was certainly the pattern in the immediate postwar period Development in the s of the eurodollar deposit market arose from the regulatory ceiling on interest rates imposed on US commercial banks The eurobond market was a response to a new withholding tax on interest payments to overseas investors in dollar bonds Yet the explosive growth of derivatives markets from the s was driven by something more akin to deregulation The collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system shifted the task of managing currency volatility from the public to the private sector The resulting huge demand for insurance against fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates was met by swaps forwards futures options and so forth Computing and telecommunications power developments in financial theory such as the BlackScholes option pricing formula and the profitmaximising instincts of bankers and traders did the rest Instruments originally used for hedging in commodity markets became a largescale financial phenomenon That said regulation did encourage important innovations in the s and s that shifted financial business from one part of the system to another Increased capital requirements encouraged banks to push business offbalancesheet via derivatives trading and securitisation of loans Hence the phenomenal growth of the mortgagebacked securities market alongside the derivatives markets A measure of the transformation can be seen in the market value of outstanding overthecounter derivatives which are growing at the expense of exchangetraded derivatives At the start of outstanding OTC derivatives amounted to bn according to the Bank for International Settlements or just over half the value of all outstanding international debt securities That is up from bn in June but down from bn at the end of when aftershocks from the Asian crisis the Russian default and the nearcollapse of the LongTerm Capital Management LTCM hedge fund increased the need for hedges against volatility The picture is one of unspectacular growth And as Professor Richard Brealey of London Business School points out the academic worlds contribution in this area though still prolific has become less productive in terms of innovation So it seems we are close to a hiatus in developing new markets while new products no longer proliferate at the same pace Could there be a limit to the efficiency gains that can be wrung from the global financial system through innovation Robert Merton the Nobel laureate has argued that growing familiarity with the use of derivatives and their capacity to reduce transaction costs will continue to underpin a rapid pace of innovation Certainly there is scope for diffusion of derivatives around the worlds less efficient markets Existing trends such as the transfer of business from banks to the markets will says LBSs Prof Brealey continue Newer instruments such as credit derivatives are growing fast although central bankers worry about their robustness in a downturn Yet transaction costs remain stubbornly high in some markets where there is an obvious job to be done witness the thinness of the market in longterm swaps Moreover there is a paradox in the way risk management acts on the efficiency of the system Before the growth in derivatives the cushion against unforeseen losses was equity capital It was a useful if often expensive protection against all kinds of risk Hedging with derivatives removes the need for an allpurpose cushion because it targets specific risks The implication ought to be that this is an efficient and cheap substitute for equity Yet partly because bank supervisors remain sceptical about banks ability to control risks with derivatives bank capital has in fact increased over the past decade at the regulators behest So capital is probably being used less efficiently in the financial system in spite of innovation A more fundamental critique of hedging comes from Daniel BenAmi who argues in a new book that the systemic tilt towards risk management is both a consequence of and an encouragement to excessive risk aversion The argument is provocative coming so soon after the technology stock bubble But it coincides with the hedge funds retreating from big betting investment banks withdrawing capital from marketmaking and a dearth of stabilising speculation in currency markets A more plausible case can nonetheless be made that increased riskaversion is happening mainly in central banks The speed and complexity of derivatives trading have completely outstripped their supervisory capability This has fuelled a tendency among central bankers to see every financial tremor as a systemic threat that calls for lastresort lending or in the case of LTCM for broking a bank rescue Meanwhile the enthusiasm with which financial institutions have shoveled assets and liabilities off the balance sheet suggests a robust appetite for risk in the face of unwelcome regulatory constraints That appetite may have been enhanced by moral hazard whereby the existence of a safety net the central bank lender of last resort encourages less prudent behaviour Either way there will always be scope for increasing efficiency in the financial system More difficult is to forecast new customer demands of the kind that arose after the end of Bretton Woods One might be the shift of social security and pension arrangements from the public to the private sector But this is a slow burn affair not an explosion While portfolio regulations for private pensions will encourage regulatory arbitrage via derivatives the scope for innovation is less obvious than in responding to floating exchange rates and financial liberalisation In retail financial markets innovation has to cope with less sophisticated users It also operates more slowly Maybe private individuals will hedge more in future against reduced earnings unemployment or fluctuations in mortgage outgoings But politics militates against a big bang removal of the state safety net Perhaps the most interesting potential lies in a reversion from pure financial hedging to tradeable insurance against realworld uncertainty The fledgling weather derivatives market for example holds promise But only a visceral optimist could assume that financial innovation will continue at the pace of the past quartercentury The coincidence of market liberalisation advances in computing and new financial theory in the s has had a truly explosive impact But it is by the same token the kind of rare historical event that does not repeat itself in a hurry Airlines and food and beverage firms targeted IFR May As a true commodity weather derivatives still have a long way to go But power and weather derivative officials at FOWs third annual Derivatives Expo last week were encouraged by the new breed of endusers they expect to see using weather derivatives particularly airlines food and beverage firms agriculturalfertiliser firms and construction firms Airlines especially those concentrated in a particular hub could use weather derivatives more actively since inclement weather can prompt many more delays than they are used to notes Claudio Ribeiro head of new products development weather risk management group Enron Food and beverage firms are also viewed as prime targets that could use weather derivatives to manage their cashflows better These companies are in need of hedges since weather can increase or decrease a firms sales dramatically Food and beverage firms typically benefit from warm weather but on occasion a food chain for example can enjoy increased sales in cold spells if the weather is extreme enough to keep customers indoors More firms are beginning to ask questions such as If theres going to be a really hot summer how does that affect my bottomline What is my systematic weather risk going to cost this summer adds Cameron Rookley financial economist at Caminus Use of weather derivatives by agricultural sector companies is also a logical step according to people in the industry especially to hedge a guaranteed sale Though no underlying market exists power and weather derivatives providers have pinned their hopes on the growth of this market in the supply and demand for derivatives No one can buy a sunny day What you can buy is just the cost of the risk associated with that sunny day says Ribeiro The way to do that is by entering into swaps and options with limits The transactions are capped to reduce aggregate exposure up to USm The structures are mostly seasonal and feature multiyear terms Weather hasnt presented itself todate to be sufficiently fungible for us to build a broad market on yet its a pretty big market nonetheless adds Robert Levin senior vicepresident planning and control development at the New York Mercantile Exchange Since September when the first weather derivatives trade occurred the market has experienced an estimated weather transactions worth more than USbn Much weather derivatives use is occurring in the natural gas propane and electricity markets Markets are currently made in heating degree days HDD cooling degree days CDD and variations such as collars forwards and swaps Through the OTC market we can create any kind of structure Ribeiro says One brake on faster growth of weather derivatives is the lack of historical data To compensate a realistic hourly weather simulation engine is needed that could replicate thousands of multiregional weather scenarios said Rookley Such a model could capture seasonal and hourly patterns for normal temperatures the extent to which temperatures deviate from their normal level and the speed at which temperatures tend to return to the norm It would also handle a correlation across weather station pairings UK building societies use of credit derivatives limited IFR May By Jean Haggerty The UK Treasurys legislation allowing building societies to use credit derivatives to protect assets against borrower default may fail to bring the societies into the credit derivatives market Initial hopes were that the Treasurys move a fortnight ago would prompt the societies to embrace synthetic securitisations and thus help fuel credit derivative market growth On closer examination those hopes seem to be fading It is unlikely to be a very big market There are few building societies remaining Also the assets suitable for synthetic securitisation are relatively small said Chris Carman a vicepresident within JP Morgans structured products group in London Building societies mortgage assets are predominantly owneroccupied residential mortgages and as such they have a capital weighting for Bank for International Settlement purposes This weighting means that they have to hold at least capital against the asset So as a synthetic securitisation would only take the capital weighting to A deal would produce limited capital savings Carman said It also means that unlike banks with a large proportion of weighted assets building societies have limited incentive to seek regulatory capital relief via the transaction said Simon Gleeson partner at solicitors Allen Overy in London As mutual societies they are also not under pressure to improve their return on equity he noted While some smaller building societies may be candidates for synthetic securitisations because they are cheaper and require less documentation than traditional securitisations others may not have concentrations large enough to warrant the use of synthetic securitisations The smaller building societies that may be viable candidates for synthetic securitisations may not be able to build the infrastructure required to otherwise actively trade credit derivatives noted Janet Tavakoli executive director and head of structuring and engineering for credit derivatives at WestLB in London Building societies would need to be securitising an asset pool of more than Em to warrant entering into the transaction because the cost of putting together these transactions is quite sizeable other industry officials said Regulatory barriers The Building Societies Commission BSC the industrys regulator last week sent letters to all UK building societies saying that only building societies deemed to have sophisticated treasury departments will be able to use credit derivatives products without asking for regulatory permission ahead of execution Only about of the societies fall into that category A building societys ability to use credit derivatives hinges on where it fits on a BSCcreated spectrum that assigns eligibility based on criteria such as sufficient experience in using derivatives and adequate systems to capture and handle credit derivatives business An institution ranked in the middle of the fivetier spectrum will have to apply and to make a strong case for why it should be able to use credit derivatives Building societies ranked in the last two categories will not be allowed to participate in the credit derivatives market Even those building societies that have large mortgage books may reject the idea of using synthetic securitisations said Nick Rice associate director at Royal Bank of Scotland in London The toptier building societies are better rated Therefore issuing vanilla debt is easier than doing synthetic securitisations he said The rapid growth of the credit derivatives market has been spurred by an increase in synthetic securitisations The British Bankers Association BBA last summer projected that the credit derivatives market would reach UStrn notional outstanding by In before synthetic securitisations were used as a method for mitigating risks the BBA estimated the credit derivatives market at roughly USbn Building societies are most likely to use synthetic securitisations in new product areas as a way to transfer out the risk related to a new product or for transferring the risk of higherweighted assets industry officials said Buytolet mortgages might prove to be an area that is ripe for synthetic securitisation as they are weighted in the UK said JP Morgans Carman Building societies could also look to synthetically securitise some of their commercial lending he added For this too they would need to hold regulatory capital he said The changes enabling building societies to use credit derivatives occurred because the BSCs regulatory jurisdiction over building societies is being transferred to the FSA in November When the new Basle Accord comes in building societies will be subject to the FSAs bank rules They will be forced to look at their credit risk management said Simon Firth partner and head of the derivatives practice at Linklaters in London Under the new Basle proposal building societies will have the option of using a capital weighting against residential mortgage assets or using an internal riskbased approach Mortgage guarantees According to some industry officials building societies current practice of using insurance to reduce borrower risk may turn out to be what prompts them to enter the credit derivatives market Theoretically credit derivatives could take the place of mortgage guarantees You could say Instead of getting an insurance policy each time someone takes out a loan why not do a portfolio trade said Firth Unlike credit derivatives mortgage guarantees carry an insurance premium tax It is unclear how the cost of using mortgage guarantees compares with credit derivatives however The ban on UK building societies use of credit derivatives dates back to the Building Societies Act and subsequent amendments to it that preceded the development of the credit derivatives market The societies have been able to use only interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives The order allowing them to use credit derivatives comes into force on July West coast blues Risk May It has been a good quarter for the big US energy trading firms Enron and Dynegy two of the largest posted exceptional firstquarter results last month buoyed by their wholesale energy trading businesses Enrons revenues increased by over the corresponding period of while Dynegys more than doubled But the news out of California the countrys largest electricity market and an area where Enron

have the position hedged Part of this is a function of Enrons own capacity We continue to develop new generating capacity which provides an inventory of future capacity sales and lowcost highvalue optionality in a highly volatile marketplace Skilling said The real danger for energy traders is not market risk but as PGEs bankruptcy illustrates counterparty credit risk This has focused the minds of traders on proper documentation collateral management termination provisions and related issues For credit and trading organisations it has always been a huge issue says Blake Herndon director of risk management at the Williams Companies in Tulsa Oklahoma The volatility has highlighted it throughout the industry he says Audit David Yeres a partner specialising in derivatives law at Clifford Chance Rogers Wells in New York says A number of our clients have asked us to do a contract audit in response to the scrutiny management is giving to these exposures and the adequacy of the documentation Mark Haedicke managing director and general counsel at Enron Capital and Trade Resources in Houston says It is the creditrelated provisions that are most important the termination provisions netting collateral thresholds He adds We work very hard at upgrading our contracts Were analysing our contracts in light of market changes and our experience in California Haedicke says there is currently a wide spectrum of contracts in use in California from very basic shortterm sale tariffs to very sophisticated master agreements The standard contract for California power trading is sponsored by the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC an industry group that monitors power generation and distribution in the western US This contract while widely used does not have stateoftheart termination and setoff netting provisions A new master agreement published last year by the Edison Electric Institute EEl a Washingtonbased electric industry group contains many cuttingedge provisions It has a structure similar to the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations master agreements Although it is not yet widely used in California it is gaining adherents We love the EEl master its an excellent form Haedicke says Prior to starting to use the EEl about nine months ago we had our own form which basically took all the financial trading provisions out of the ISDA master and put it into a power trading context Clifford Chances Yeres expects that I the California crisis will accelerate acceptance of moresophisticated master agreements Counterparties are eager to do business on a single counterparty to single counterparty basis governed by a master that allows netting he says The EEl master is designed so counterparties can adjust its provisions to suit their credit risk management policies There is a lot of optionality built into the master says Andy Katz director of industry legal affairs at the EEl For instance you can set up any kind of structure using collateral threshold amounts or guarantees or any type of credit support mechanism I know a lot of the suppliers have added quite a bit of additional language for transactions with the California Department of Water Resources CDIR the state agency that now purchases power on behalf of the utilities he says Concerns over the states own credit quality are affecting the CDWRs level of credit risk Some traders believe the WSCCs document is adequate as long as counterparties keep counterparty risk standards tight The WSCC has done well for us over the last five years says Kevin Fox senior vicepresident and general manager of the commodity service division at Aquila in Kansas City Fox says Aquilas main response to the California crisis has been to keep a close eye on its counterparty risk If we had a lot of positions with one counterparty we would put on countervailing positions to flatten it out he says Despite the conflicts between counterparties in the California energy market the EEl master has not itself been tested in court However the concepts contained in the EEl master that are similar to those in the ISDA master agreement which has stood the test of time and been proven in court ISDA itself has an initiative under way that when complete could benefit energy marketers operating in California It is looking at ways to expand its master agreement to cover both physical and financial transactions Haedicke who is an ISDA board member and chair of the energy and developing products committee looking into this says It would be a much more efficient world if we could find a way to use the ISDA master for both physically and financially settled transactions and find a way to net across physical and financial Collateral Collateral is another area being scrutinised in the wake of the California crisis The energy trading firms will not only look harder at creditworthiness but also more importantly they will reconsider their policies on collateral Clifford Chances Yeres says Traditionally energy firms have not been as collateral conscious he says but they are now becoming much more so An important part of this especially when price volatility is high is the need to tightenup marktomarket requirements for collateral Yeres says Counterparties are eager for more frequent and accurate marktomarket provisions and for terms that give the party with the net exposure the right to receive collateral promptly For contracts that are not written with adequate or even any collateral provisions there is still a way for counterparties to manage their credit risk if they have written their contracts under New York law Yeres says Under the concept of adequate assurances in New York law a party to a forward contract with reasonable grounds to be insecure about the ability of its counterparty to fulfill its responsibilities may demand performance assurance such as collateral If the demand is denied it may be able to terminate the contract Market participants say this is not standard practice although many contracts are written under New York law because the courts have a strong understanding of and long track record with derivatives litigation Termination and settlement provisions are also vital Depending on documentation some energy traders have been able to terminate and closeout transactions at an earlier stage than others using the socalled early termination events Yeres says These include crossdefault provisions not only with the counterpartys other credit agreements but also increasingly with the credit agreements of its affiliates Settlement provisions are also important If a party terminates a contract early for failure to deliver or some other reason the contract must specify how the compensation will be calculated From the early days of this market it has been apparent that the old terms like force majeure dont work unless there is a price attached RCMs St Germain says There is a debate over whether compensation should be based on a market quote or on liquidated damages This is a controversy typical of new markets participants in the bandwidth trading market are trying to reach a durable accord on the same topic Risk November page Generally the markets preference depends on liquidity Yeres says Where the market is not fully liquid and quotes are not reliable participants use liquidated damages A final area where contracts are being scrutinized in dispute resolution There is currently no consensus on this topic Different market participants reflect their institutional preferences For example financial institutions highly value the predictability of litigation while trading companies have been satisfied with arbitration which is faster Yeres says He predicts that as transaction sizes grow the trading companies will begin to value litigations predictability over arbitrations speed Strategies To survive the California crisis intact trading and power supply firms must have sound credit risk hedging strategies For example before PGEs bankruptcy Dynegy Reliant Energy Duke Energy and Mirant all set aside reserves against their exposure to the utility Calpine a San Jose California independent power producer did not and its stock has suffered since PGEs bankruptcy filing The utility owed Calpine million as of March Some energy marketers are rumoured to have sold short PGE and Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison in the second half of Others have sought protection in the credit derivatives market but default swap spreads on PGE and Edison widened rapidly last summer after the ex tent of the energy crisis became apparent and protection quickly became unavailable In either case there is substantial basis risk but the hedges should have provided some protection nonetheless Traders say that above all aggressive counterparty credit risk management is crucial In his earnings conference call Enrons Skilling said his firm calculates the credit quality of each of the more than counterparties in its portfolio At the end of the day we run our credit exposures against that and it kicks out what we need to reserve We have done this for a decade Our credit reserves are significant and totally a function of whats happening in the marketplace every day Aquilas Fox agrees Basically we have been setting our credit exposure limit to each counterparty based on the high prices we began to see last June Despite this many trading companies still have to endure long and uncertain workout processes Enron and other trading firms have been appointed to PGEs creditors committee The PGE bankruptcy process promises to be long and contentious not least because the company will find it hard to form a business plan until Californian politicians and regulators agree on a solution to its energy crisis The costs and opportunity costs of working through this debacle should ensure that the lessons of the California crisis are long remembered European settlement systems under fire Financial Times May By Vincent Boland Central securities depositories and futures exchanges need to cooperate on the recurring problem of unsuccessful transactions in the European securities markets according to the International Securities Markets Association ISMA said yesterday representatives of its European repo committee had held a frank and open discussion with CSDs to address the issue of settlement failures transactions where one or other party to a deal fails to settle its end of the bargain on time or at all While allowances would be made for the nature of the market a major factor contributing to the relatively high level of settlement failures in the European securities markets is the fragmentation of settlement systems the large number of clearing and settlement depositories and the different timeframes within which each custodian operates ISMA said these bodies needed to work together in a constructive way to provide a more harmonised security settlement environment in Europe to substantially reduce the number of failed transactions The organisations intervention will increase pressure on Europes different clearing and settlement systems to speed up cooperation so costs can also be reduced US banks and investors claim processing transactions in Europe costs up to seven times as much as in the US where most clearing and settlement is handled by the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation End of ISDA Press Report for May THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA

lust being felt in the credit derivatives market While not viewed as the final word on the tricky issue of R the modifications have been broadly welcomed When Ernest Goodrich md of Deutsche Bank announced at ISDAs recent AGM that a consensus had been reached on the credit derivative markets restructuring problem the audience held its breath Despite the heavy hints that ISDA was going to make such a timely announcement things had not looked promising However at the eleventh hour ISDA announced its Restructuring Supplement to the ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions Clarity The definitions of restructuring were a huge improvement on the previous ISDA confirmations says Thomas Riggs vp and associate general counsel of Goldman Sachs However they were a compromise and exposed credit protection sellers to risks that cannot easily be priced or managed Clearly something had to be done A clearer definition of R will be beneficial says Paolo Josca head of credit derivatives in New York for Banca Commerciale Italiana Restructuring is often the first sign of a company in distress Josca admits however that even if the ISDA modification becomes adopted as a market standard variations will still exist Brian Barrett director at Merrill Lynch agrees The main complaint following Conseco was that the restructuring clause exposed credit protection sellers to the protection buyers cheapesttodeliver option To address these complaints dealers have proposed to substantially limit the permitted maturities of deliverables if the buyer triggers the settlement of a default swap based on R as a credit event Despite dealers attempts to find this common ground I am not sure that the modified R will be acceptable to all Many traders are sceptical that a single uniform contract for credit derivatives is possible However there is broad agreement that a clear standard framework is needed ISDA expects that trades will still continue without R but hopes that the new supplement will ease levels of confusion and reduce the RINR spread In fact Dennis Oakley ISDA treasurer and md of JP Morgan cites a recent fiveyear default swap that traded with the new R supplement only two basis points more expensive than NR The old restructuring clause has been as much as Olbp more expensive The main elements of the new restructuring definition Limit the number of alternatives to one revised approach which is preferable to having more options Impose a maturity limitation on deliverables State that deliverables must be fully transferable Take into account the BIS proposals on the restructuring compromise Of course the new Basel capital adequacy proposal requires restructuring in credit derivatives in order for them to qualify for capital relief What impact will ISDAs new modification have on this document ISDA states that the BIS proposal is still at an early stage and argues that it made more sense for the Association to develop its restructuring modification first introduce it to the market and then take it to the regulators This new option is structured on the same lines as other ISDA supplements explains Richard Kennaugh md of JP Morgan You can specify the extent to which you want to incorporate the supplement into your transaction it is easily done within a sentence or two We hope everyone utilises the modified version Positive While this may not be the final word on restructuring and while it may come under attack for being too US big bank biased or not going far enough ISDAs new restructuring supplement is generally considered to be a positive development for the credit derivatives market There has been a high degree of noise about restructuring in recent months says Blythe Masters global head of credit derivatives at JP Morgan This is only natural and is indicative of the fact that the credit derivatives business has grown sufficiently to be on the financial radar screen Credit Derivatives FOW May By Jane Sandiford Underpinning recent wellpublicised developments in the industry the credit derivatives market is seeing a steady flow of business with volumes up on the same time last year We have been doing some quite interesting portfolio trades says one trader We have also structured some tax arbitrage trades synthetic collateralized debt obligations and completed a lot of relative value trades Interestingly we have been pricing up some spread options again we have not done that since This is probably the result of recent market volatility and credit spread widening While we have not seen anything ground breaking we have been doing some interesting I deals recently Another trader points to the increasing accessibility of more structured credit derivatives deals At one stage in the not too distant past we would not have attempted to get involved in the more exotic transactions such as synthetics he explains However now we are quite involved in this market the mystery has gone and we can now see what we can do with these instruments In addition Deutsche Bank has recently structured an interesting deal The deals floatingrate notes have been provisionally rated by SP At closing Deutsche Bank will issue eurodenominated notes As there is no collateral for the notes Deutsche Bank will pay the principal and interest on the notes Deutsche Banks obligation is however linked to the performance of a static EURbn reference portfolio of investmentgrade reference entities There exists therefore a credit risk not only on Deutsche Banks ability to repay the notes but also on the performance of the reference pool explains Katrien Van Acoleyen associate at SPs structured finance ratings group in London Both of these issues are adequately addressed by the BB rating If a credit event occurs in the reference portfolio all the conditions to payment have been met and the total losses with respect to the portfolio exceed the threshold amount then the repayment of the notes will be reduced with the cash settlement amount defaulted amount less recovery as calculated by Deutsche Bank as calculation agent At the same time as the notes are issued Deutsche Bank will also enter into two unfunded credit default swaps which are senior to the notes Final maturity of the notes is April but the notes can redeem early if the notional amount has been reduced to zero and ii when an event of default or adverse tax change occurs on the notes Meanwhile credit derivative brokers are looking to market the product to new potential users We have been looking to target energy and utility houses says one The credit risk aspect of energy has really hit home over the past year especially following the bankruptcy filing from the US Pacific Gas and Electricity Company Those companies that are exposed to such energy risk are now seeking the protection that can be offered via credit derivatives Energy companies are not the only institutions feeling the pain of energy risk One market source warns that some synthetic securitisation structures issued by major credit derivatives players may be under pressure and may be downgraded as a result of the impact of the Californian power crisis Some of these deals have exposure to US power utilities says the source This is something we are watching very closely indeed As FOW went to press the full impact of ISDAs new restructuring modification had yet to be felt We are waiting for our lawyers to go through the supplement and come back with their recommendations says one structurer However it seems a sensible solution and is along the lines of what we have seen developing in the market I would agree with comments that the new supplement will narrow credit spreads While this may not be the end of the matter it is good news for credit derivatives Restructuring the solution FOW May Any or all of the following definitions and provisions may be incorporated into a document by wording in the document indicating that or the extent to which the

receive assets of the Reference Entity distributable to the Subordinated Holders to the extent that the Reference Entitys assets otherwise fail to satisfy the claims represented by Senior Holders until the claims of the Senior Holders against the Reference Entity are paid in full For the avoidance of doubt the provision of collateral credit support or credit enhancement with respect to any

Credit Derivative Transaction exceed the Floating Rate Payer Calculation Amount of such Credit Derivative Transaction ISDA Prepares To Tackle Soft Credit Event Definitions Derivatives Week May By Victor Kremer The International Swaps and Derivatives Association over the next several weeks will canvass credit derivative dealers hedgers and investors with a view to revising socalled soft credit event definitions in credit derivative documentation Bob Pickel executive director and CEO of ISDA in New York told DW there will be changes to the credit event definitions declining to put a timeframe on the move The issue has been a focus of discussion as the synthetic CDO and credit default swap markets have grown but raised eyebrows recently when Moodys Investors Service and Deutsche Bank engaged in a skirmishvia conflicting research reportson the potential magnitude and probability of soft credit events according to market professionals The debate centers on credit events that are short of outright bankruptcy or default being included in credit derivative contracts ISDA documentation recognizes credit events that do not necessarily entail a default such as the in furtherance of clause of the bankruptcy definition which could cover an obligor considering filing for bankruptcy explained Jeffrey Tolk vp and senior credit officer at Moodys in New York If publicly reported Tolk continued these considerations could trigger a loss payment under a credit default swap even if the obligor does not enter bankruptcy In a report published at the beginning of the month Deutsche Bank concedes that synthetic credit instruments may carry an element of documentation basis risk that is not present in a conventional cash security However John Tierney the reports author continues We think Moodys goes too far in implying that the presence of certain credit events in synthetic securities exposes investors ie protection sellers to a materially greater degree of default risk and loss Its an unquantifiable risk and that makes us and investors uncomfortable said Moodys Tolk Rather than overstating the issue the rating agency asserts that the definition of these soft credit events is so broad that their inclusion in documentation exposes investors to an unknown level of risk ISDA seems to be considering our point of view he continued ISDAs Pickel confirmed that the association is moving towards Moodys definitions The associations G subcommittee of the Credit Derivatives Market Practice Group met last Tuesday to set an agenda for tackling the credit definitions Several investors said they share Moodys concerns with the inclusion of soft credit event definitions in ISDA documentation Thats where it gets a little dicey one investor noted adding that the soft credit definitions should be dropped A credit derivatives trader in London noted ISDA is in the early stages of looking at the definitions but agreed that some credit event definitions might be taken out of the ISDA documentation You dont have to wait for ISDA he said adding that counterparties can agree to strike the language from their documentation when they enter transactions Its the end of the w as we know it FOW May By Jane Sandiford Is the end nigh for w Judging from comments at ISDAs AGM last month the future looks bleak for Basels now infamous proposed capital charge for credit derivatives Derided by the very regulators you would expect to defend it traders now question how w can survive Market views on the whole have been negative explains Roger Tufts senior economic advisor capital policy division at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency I expect that w will eventually go away The credit derivatives market has condemned the charge in no uncertain terms and the comments from the ISDA ACM have been broadly welcomed It is good to hear the regulators admit that w makes no sense to them either says one trader I would now expect w to be clarified and at the very least the capital charge reduced The need for clarity on this and other features of the Basel proposal was noted at the ISDA AGM by William McDonough chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York I know that it is of particular concern that we may be confusing legal risks with other risks I think this is right Emmanuelle Sebton head of risk management at ISDA is particularly heartened to hear McDonoughs comments She hopes by bringing more clarity on the nature and purpose of the w charge the debate that ISDA has had with the regulators will eventually lead to the conclusion that the charge is unjustified and should be removed from the proposed Capital Accord I agree with McDonoughs comments on the w factor says Thomas Boemio senior supervisory financial analyst policy development section on the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System We call w the whatever factor We are not sure what it is for it is mainly a legal risk As such the market believes w should be consigned to the operational risk area The US regulators seem to be in agreement what is not so clear is the position the European regulators will take However with criticism coming from all sides of the debate traders believe that xv will soon be consigned to the dustbin of history a lucky near miss for credit derivatives ISDA fights for right to counterparty FOW May By Corinne Smith The International Swaps Derivatives Association ISDA announced at its recent AGM its proposals for the treatment of counterparty credit risk as part of its response to the easel Committees proposed new Capital Accord ISDA responded to Basels first consultative paper in February last year saying that the current treatment of counterparty risk could be improved and needed further work before setting a new framework for a regulatory capital charge In October last year we created the Counterparty Risk Working Group to formulate ISDAs response which was chaired by Tom Wilde director at Credit Suisse First Boston and which represented institutions nine of which participated in a quantitative calibration exercise says Katia DHulster policy director at ISDA in London We have now finalised our proposals and they will be included as an annex to our official Basel response which is due by the end of May Although ISDA completed the major part of its work on counterparty credit risk before the publication of Basels second consultative paper in January the Association was pleased to note a paragraph about the Committees willingness to accept potential future exposure PFE modelling in the document a sign of progress towards addressing counterparty risk on a more risk sensitive basis Internal models The current rules for counterparty risk require institutions to calculate a credit equivalent exposure for derivatives as the sum of the current value if positive and an add on obtained by multiplying the derivative notional by fixed regulatory factors depending on the underlying market This is a very crude way of calculating a regulatory capital charge for counterparty risk explains DHulster What we propose is that the Basel Committee allow banks to calculate these credit equivalent exposures using their internal models Just as in the current rules however these exposures would then be risk weighted in the same way as other credit assets This twostep approach is one aspect of the current rules that we are not proposing to change In the first step banks calculate credit equivalent exposures and in the second step these exposures are treated as normal credit assets The alternative is to use internal models to calculate capital directly from derivatives positions ISDA regards this as the ultimate goal but recognises that it must follow in the footsteps of internal modelling for fixed exposures which the regulators are not yet ready to accept For firms that do not have internal models of counterparty risk the existing method could remain in place with some modification However many banks already have appropriate internal models for these calculations although they would need to be reviewed and approved by regulators We recommend that for the calculation of credit equivalent exposures banks use the concept of expected positive exposure says Wilde By the end of this year the Basel Committee will have prepared its final proposals so we would like it to consider our work on counterparty risk We would also like to see the European Union consider our work in its Capital Adequacy Directive Bankers Call Credit Their No Risk Fear American Banker May By Nicole Darn WASHINGTON Bankers say credit economic capital and systems risk in that order are their top three risk management concerns Capital Market Risk Advisors a New York financial advisory firm specializing in risk management surveyed bankers worldwide on their risk management concerns and thoughts about economic capital The firm found emergingmarket and investment banks were more gravely concerned about integrating market and credit risk than did nonemergingmarket foreign banks US banks and other financial institutions Of the banks surveyed said they use internal models for marketrisk regulatory capital and use the Basel standardized measurement method Of those using the Basel method said they plan to move to internal models None of the emergingmarket banks said they use internal models now but said they plan to Most of the major banks and investment banks said they are currently using internal models Sixtythree percent of all bank respondents said that if the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision would let banks use their own credit risk models now they would not yet be ready to make the switch BoEs Clementi Cautions Knowledge Of Systemic Risk Low Dow Jones Newswires May By David Cottle LONDON The Bank of Englands role in combating systemic risk arouses far more internal debate than its monetary policy the Banks Deputy Governor David Clementi said Wednesday In a speech on Banks and Systemic Risk at the Bank of Englands annual conference Clementi said that while the target for inflation is clear and transparent the global understanding of systemic risk is in a very preliminary stage He added that the very definition of such risk along with the problems of measuring it and the policy weapons used to combat it remain fundamental questions which the international banking community so far has provided only partial answers He pointed to a lack of evidence of systemic shocks Whilst banking crises are not exactly rare they are episodic rather than regular and they tend to exhibit a number of idiosyncratic characteristics he said What is not in doubt Clementi added is that financial crises specifically banking crises produce real economic costs He highlighted the immediate costs to the public sector if ailing banks have to be bailed out in addition to longer term costs to growth He pointed out that banking crises have become more common with four out of the G most developed countries suffering one in the last decade Clementi said that the increasing trend in global banking towards consolidation may lead to safer banks in the long run it could also make bank failure more damaging in its impact Additionally the changing nature of bank activity also affects risk profiles he said New markets new customers new products new technology increase the risk of something going wrong if the industrys risk assessment procedures do not keep pace he said He highlighted the need to risk proof the global banking system through measures such as the Basel Accord on capital adequacy Market discipline and disclosure are two cornerstones of this process Clement said He added however that there is no point in enhancing disclosures if the market has no incentive to apply the information because it believes that banks will not be allowed to fail The goal of improving and harnessing market discipline has to go hand in hand with the continued rolling back of state guarantees to banks whether formal or implicit he said On the implications of the Basel accord for the level of capital in the banking system Clementi stressed the need to achieve a balance Erring on the low side of a minimum capital standard could result in an unacceptable risk whereas to err on the high side is likely to result in wasteful and costly regulatory arbitrage he said EU collateral Directive FOW May By Jane Sandiford ISDA is now asking jurisdictions around the world to update their legal opinion on the document We anticipate that the process depending on the jurisdiction should take six months says ISDAs assistant general counsel Kimberley Summe Those requests for counsel will go out this month and I would anticipate that by late fall we should have them in and well then make them available on our Website While the new provisions have been broadly welcomed significant hurdles remain There are considerable technical constraints to be overcome to enact the documentation says James Crabb head of collateral management at Barclays Capital Crabb warns that the documentation is biased in favour of larger banks that have access to a wider range of collateral Meanwhile the EU has proposed a new Directive to create a uniform EU legal framework to limit credit risk in financial transactions through the provision of securities and cash as collateral The Directive is largely in keeping with ISDAs new Provisions This Directive promises to support the growing use of collateral in the EU removing many unnecessary obstacles says Robert Pickel ISDAs Executive Director and CEO The EUs internal market commissioner Frits Bolkestein says that the proposal is the first step towards integration of the financial market for collateral in the EU He adds that the proposal tackles a major disincentive to crossborder transactions Market operators currently face different legal regimes for the provision of collateral complicated potential conflicts between jurisdictions and uncertainties surrounding the law applicable to crossborder transfers of securities This proposal would determine which law governs crossborder collateral arrangements and would make it possible for market participants to conclude such arrangements in the same manner throughout the EU says Bolkestein China to Ease Rate Rules The New York Times May SHANGHAI May China plans to relax its control of foreign currency lending rates by the second half of the year China Securities News has reported Banks will be permitted to adjust their foreign currency lending rates to bring them more into line with market demand than they are permitted to now Foreign currency lending rates are now set by the central bank The change is part of a plan to permit banks to set all lending rates within years and all deposit rates within to years the paper said Relaxing state control is a critical step toward achieving the governments goal of making the countrys currency fully convertible Devaluation Talk Just That And No More A Dow Jones Newswires Column May By James Areddy HONG KONG Markets make it a rule to ignore government promises not to devalue a currency But it also makes sense to disregard statements from Beijing that sound as if its commitment to a stable currency has waned In Malaysia economists have glazed right over promises from Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad that the ringgits peg is secure since sentiment is widespread that the exchange rate is unsustainable It was the same thing in February when Turkeys government expressed its support for the lira before it crashed and the way markets also cast a suspicious eye toward indebted Argentinas peso Some even regard devaluation plans as one of the few times a government has a good reason to lie since officials have a mandate to maintain market confidence in the national currency as long as possible So its strange to hear Chinese officials not market players hint they have lost the faith Instead of highlighting Chinas strong balance of payments position or that it has the worlds second largest trove of foreign exchange reserves as other governments might officials have made headlines in recent weeks by pointing out the yuan exchange rates stress points Their statements bring many traders back to and the then downward spiral of the Japanese yen When the US currency started climbing toward Y in the middle of that year China led the rest of Asia with acrimonious statements that Japans failure to address its economic problems undermined market confidence in the yen Threatened by China with a competitive devaluation of the yuan at a time of extreme global financial turmoil authorities in the US and Japan put an end to the yens slide with welltimed intervention in world currency markets Chinese devaluation fears receded as the yen rebounded on worries about more intervention Now some think they hear echoes of the past in Chinas rhetoric A clouding of the US economic picture sour relations with Washington and most of all the new vulnerability of Japans yen help make the latest Chinese arguments sound shrill A consistent depreciation of the yen against the dollar would create pressure on the stability of the yuan exchange rate the Peoples Bank of China warned this month China needs to take measures to improve the competitiveness of its exports the countrys Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation chimed in a few days later No Face Value Yet the way things stand now virtually no one takes Chinas worries at face value Gray market rates of the yuan in Hong Kong are stable and point to strengthening while purveyors of derivatives who offer plays on the nonconvertible yuan are having a dull spell One analyst says China is merely reminding the market that its commitment doesnt equate stability in the yuan forever and no matter what Another said Asia collectively wants to keep pressure on Japan noting South Korea also hackled when the yen headed south And its not a critical situation Chinas current account balance is expected to remain in surplus of of gross domestic product this year albeit down from of GDP last year according to Goldman Sachs Co The firms early warning signals pick up no financial risk regarding China Yes analysts say Beijing is concerned that another big fall in the Japanese currency would weaken its ability to compete with Japanese companies in thirdparty export markets like the US It would also reduce Chinas ability to carve out space in the liberalizing Japanese market and to draw investment from Japanese companies But Chinas actions speak louder than its words on the currency The yuan has remained rock solid for over seven years in the face of both downward and upward pressures some of them severe as in And its worth noting the words themselves have been anything but alarmist so far In fact analysts say Beijing has reassured that it will allow market forces to set the yuan only gradually PBOC Gov Dai Xianglongs bottom line is that the yuan will remain stable although not fixedso please rest assured Chinas myriad political and economic considerations growing oil import dependency budding statesmanship and hopes to get top dollar in its privatizations make it difficult to argue that devaluation would provide a net benefit Nor is it easy to say China has less responsibility to the rest of Asia than it did three years ago when the regions economies were being pummeled Chinese devaluation then most certainly would have forced a new round of currency instability throughout a highly indebted and crisishit Asia But while a weaker Chinese currency now probably wouldnt collapse Asian economies it would be hard to pull off without making Beijing look greedy Chinas buoyant albeit weaker export figures support the view that it continues to take market share away from the rest of the region increasingly in the critical electronics sector The region is already unsettled by the singular focus foreign investors have on China China has accounted for virtually all of the regions equity fund raising so far this year up from of the total last year according to Deutsche Bank AG The argument that China would use a devaluation to punish the US for downgrading relations also fails to hold water The punch it would give other Asian countries would undermine the Chinese leaderships recent whirlwind of diplomacy through Asia And with US relations in the dumps China now needs friends in the region more than at any time during the past decade according to Yiping Huang a Citigroup Inc economist in Hong Kong A devaluation would also upset the countrys existing foreign investors People who last year pumped US billion into Chinese stocks and US billion into factories and such on the mainland would look like suckers who paid too much A sudden drop in the currency would also probably crash the Hong Kong stock market denting the interests of a lot of those China is counting on to provide recurrent FDI and demand in future stock offerings analysts point out The Ministry of Finance sent no devaluation signals this month to the investors around the globe who demonstrated an overwhelmingly positive response to its first sovereign bond offering in about three years according to Dennis Zhu who helped organize the US billion dollareuro deal Zhu JP Morgan Chase Cos China head of investment banking said that may be because investors think China has the ability to control its currency and he downplayed the risks altogether It would be different for a country like Thailand or Malaysia where balance of payment weaknesses make a controlled devaluation less of a certainty Zhu said Or consider the US export market China is trying to climb the technology ladder but where it competes most is in the consumer realm where weaker demand would surely affect its sales of clothes and toys Increasingly for these type of goods says Coudert Bros trade attorney Owen Nee the choice is do you buy from China or do you buy from Mexico And the peso is trading near threeyear highs against the US dollar Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia Ltd like many other houses was wrong in to bet on a Chinese currency fall and it still sees Beijing as frantic at the prospects of seeing exports or foreign exchange reserves slip The obvious solution would be to allow the currency to depreciate according to Chief Economist Jim Walker But now he puts the currency question in a broader context When top posts are shifted in the Chinese government next year reformers like Prime Minister Zhu Rongji will want incoming policy makers to back their decisions such as to join the World Trade Organization Devaluation according to Walker would make China appear weak in the face of the global competition the reformers have so embraced Still according to CLSA expect the rhetoric and the risk to increase sharply if the yen trades through Y New CEO Helps Build Future For Singapore Exchange Asia Wall Street Journal May By Shu Shin Luh Singapore A year ago last month Tom Kloet became the most senior foreigner ever appointed to Singapores stock and futures exchanges since the islands colonial times The Americans appointment as the chief executive of the Singapore Exchange Ltd after a yearlong search fits with the Singapore governments push to attract foreign talent who will advance the island nations position as a cuttingedge regional financial hub The Singapore Exchange became Asias first integrated securities and derivatives exchange after a merger of the Singapore Stock Exchange and the Singapore International Monetary Exchange in December The exchange saw an exodus of longtime executives during its early days Mr Kloet who had been a senior managing director at ABN Amro in Chicago and a board member at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange arrived in April and spent his first months rebuilding a senior management team Since then the exchange has gone public and established various alliances such as with the American Stock Exchange and the Australian Stock Exchange among other highlights Three weeks ago the exchange joined a growing number of Singapore companies that are reporting financial earnings quarterly as part of the citystates effort to improve corporate transparency Mr Kloet speaks about his first year at the exchange in an interview The following is an edited excerpt Q What do you think are the highlights of your first year as CEO A Weve embarked on a number of exciting initiatives including everything from a solid new management team to new alliances Seven out of of the people on my team werent with the institution months ago plus me But weve hired a group that is great We have a cohesiveness being built thats very important Together with that we have successfully completed the transfer of our company from an entity that operated like a memberowned organization to a customerdriven organization It takes time but were making progress on that including privatizing and taking the company public with the stock If I may borrow Winston Churchills words thats not the end not even the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning to create the future of the exchange As an institution with a smaller domestic market we believe we have to reach out to enter a network of relationships Q Was it difficult to build a new management team A When I came there were definitely a few holes we had to fill There were a few who chose to leave We didnt tell them to do it Theres a lot of talent here in Singapore But we also brought in people from outside Singapore where we thought we needed expertise that we couldnt find in Singapore Q Many multinationals aim to recruit locally for their offices in Asia Do you also try to do the same for the exchange A Some jobs will require us to go outside because the business line simply doesnt exist here Clearly our first choice would be to look domestically for people we see every day and who know this market But we will look where we can get for the best people and thats the only thing that drives us Q Recently Singapore has encouraged local companies to recruit global talent You are certainly one of them What are your thoughts on global talent A Whether Im Singaporean American French or from wherever is not the issue The most important thing is will I help the exchange fulfill its ambition in the global marketplace I would interpret the governments move to be bring the talent as needed I wouldnt say its easy to attract people to move But Singapore is an easy place to get acclimated to The commute is short the lifestyle here is pretty good I personally like the climate People find it easy to raise families here In relative terms Singapore is a pretty easy sale Q How difficult was it for the exchange to transition from a governmentrun organization to a commercial one A I think its still evolving Thats not a cultural change the CEO dictates Its a cultural change the institution moves toward I think were moving as fast as we could Certainly members and participants are important to listen to We want to make sure our team doesnt lose the focus to listen The change to a commercial entity requires one to consider the profitandloss ramifications of the services you provide We also provide a regulatory function I think weve found the balancing act Doing it is not as easy Q How has the exchange benefited from going public A First off it gives the institution a certain freedom to act as a commercial entity Also it puts a financial discipline on the organization that a member organization generically might not have Like any new public company we make sure were as transparent as we can be We gave third quarter results three weeks ago We think its the right thing to do We want to make sure the exchange is setting a standard for global best practices We are making an effort to be as transparent and still be effective in the marketplace Were learning Q Being transparent goes hand in hand with good corporate governance a topic frequently discussed here How do Singapore companies measure up to that A Over the last three years I think Singapore has made terrific strides to improving the corporate governance We announced we would adopt the corporate governance code and require our listed companies to disclose noncompliance to that code Rather than prescribing a set of corporate governance requirements that says heres what the standards should be we think we should tell shareholders when somethings wrong Thats the best for the market at this time I admire Singapore as somebody whos come on scene late for not withstanding the improvement that have been made to yet take the next step They are not sitting and resting on the laurels but taking the next step Q How have you applied your experiences serving as a board member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to your management of the exchange here A Its the ability to think outside the box a bit Our whole management team is learning to do it here You have to make sure your people know that its not bad to be wrong One cant be afraid to be wrong but dont be wrong because you havent done the research An idea should be able to come up from anywhere in the organization There should also be a trust level between colleagues As the CEO I try to encourage having an institution where anybody in the institution can email me I tell everyone to call me Tom I would say thats quite unusual in the Singapore context ISDA Opposes the FASBs Proposed Changes on Hybrid Instruments HedgeWorld May By Christopher Faille NEW YORK HedgeWorldcomThe International Swap Dealers Association wishes the Financial Accounting and Standards Board would adhere to the old adage if it aint broke dont fix it That is the gist of the ISDA comment filed on April in response to an FASB exposure draft on accounting for compound financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity such as convertible bonds The amount of change to the accounting model that has taken place in the last four years has been enormous Such change has put a strain on the resources of both the financial statement preparer community as well as those of the financial statement users who are still tying to digest the significance of the new guidance so far and adjust their analytics accordingly their comment argued The ISDA is particularly unhappy about what it calls bifurcationthat is the idea implicit in the exposure draft that an instrument should be broken down unto liability and equity components which can then be assigned to their place on the balance sheet and accounted for separately The ISDA acknowledges one important point in favor of the proposed change it would bring American standards in line with the approach employed by the International Accounting Standards Commission and thus contribute to convergence But the ISDA adds that it does not consider their acceptance of bifurcation to be an obligation for adoption by US standard setters One industry authority consulted by HedgeWorld suggested that the volume and sophistication of the market for convertibles in the United States makes this country a special case and justifies nonconvergence The source also indicated that bifurcation is not a simple matter because it may create the misleading appearance that the liability and equity components of an instrument are entirely unrelated whereas in economic fact and as marketed they are intertwined Some industry skepticism notwithstanding this exposure draft seems not to have stirred up the same sort of hornets nest as have other recent FASB initiatives such as the recent elimination of asset pooling for mergers All mergers initiated after June must use the purchase method In a closely related move the FASB has also lately determined that effective next year pure goodwill recorded on corporate balance sheets will no longer be amortized but will be subjected to an impairment approach In a page report issued in mid May a financial services firm Friedman Billings Ramsey Co concluded that the net effects of these changes will be bullish for stocks We anticipate the psychological perception of applying current PE ratios to higher future GAAP earnings will result in higher stock prices wrote the FBRs senior analyst Laurie Hunsicker Ms Hunsicker acknowledges that the new accounting methods do not change the underlying economic realities but expects that psychology will trump such matters Banks account Financial Times May Who could argue against the disclosure of fair values in company accounts Bankers who are seething over plans to change the way they account for financial instruments such as derivatives and loans to customers The plans have been drawn up by the Joint Working Group a body made up mainly of accounting standardsetters from the worlds biggest economies Bankers say the results would lead to dramatic swings in the value of balance sheet assets that would often be meaningless and potentially damaging It is certainly the case that the existing accounting rules often fail to reflect the impact of changes in interest rates or credit risks on bank earnings Fair value accounting would force banks to adjust their accounts in the light of rises and falls in the values of all financial instruments The result would be greater volatility in profits but proponents of the change say it would give investors a truer picture of corporate health Not so say the banks While fair value accounting is appropriate for trading activities it would not reflect the real business of making longterm loans to customers which are largely held to maturity and therefore rarely traded Banks manage loan portfolios to make a stable interest margin over the terms of the loans not on the profits determined each year in relation to the interest rate at the time This is more than an academic argument Supporters of fair value accounting say the existing state of affairs masks the real financial position of banks one reason why banks are often given lower stock market ratings than securities houses which mark their loans to market Opponents say the volatility of fair value accounting would not only confuse consumers and investors it could lead banks to withdraw from lending that caused volatility even though it was safe At worst the result would be to amplify the economic cycle with sudden withdrawals of credit accentuating the downturn when markets slow The issue is further complicated by the continuing international negotiations over the amount of capital banks have to hold The new Basle accord would base capital requirements on risk assessments rather than market pricing leading some bankers to fear a divergence between the Basle formula and accounting standards It is impossible to argue against greater transparency in bank accounting but it should be recognised that there is more than one way to capture financial reality Much more work is needed before fair value accounting can be proclaimed as the right answer for banks IASB Taking Tentative Steps on Agenda With Help From National Rulemaking Groups BNA May By Steve Burkholder LONDONThe International Accounting Standards Board took more steps May to set its rulemaking agenda placing fasttrack efforts to improve existing standards and to ease companies switching to international rules at the front of a long docket The steps are tentative however Under its constitution IASB must consult with its advisory councilwhich is yet to be namedbefore it can formally fix an agenda A meeting with the advisory panel is expected to take place in July The improvements project is an omnibus effort intended to mend a variety of rules IASB inherited from its predecessor board the International Accounting Standards Committee and to rid those standards of inconsistencies and inappropriate choices in accounting methods The transition or firsttime application project is being watched closely by the Big accounting firms and their European clientcompanies That audience is mindful of the planned European Union directive that would require some companies in the region to carry out their financial reporting using international standards by New Rules by End of For that to occur and to remedy the concerns of securities regulators IASB effectively has to significantly improve a variety of accounting rules and issue new ones by the end of In addition IASB expects to tackle a project on business combinations quickly and hopes to have it done in comparatively short order The focus of the planned work on merger and acquisition accounting would be to consider barring the poolingofinterests method of accounting and adopt the purchase method instead IASB also plans to target the treatment of goodwill a key element in purchase accounting and weigh a possible adoption of impairment against the survival of the writedown of goodwill acquired in a combination As with all standardsetting projects and less substantial efforts the board has its eye on convergence It is working toward issuing a single set of high quality accounting rules that could be used by companies around the world in raising capital Heavy Involvement of National Boards The path to that goal will include heavy involvement of major national standardsetting bodies in the rulemaking of IASB The mechanisms for that workwhich are to include joint projects and other partnership working arrangementswere detailed in a meeting May with the heads of standardsetting panels from Australia Canada France Germany Japan New Zealand the United Kingdom and the United States IASB has formal liaison relationships with those boards A sharing of human resources by the sparely staffed IASB and groups such as the US Financial Accounting Standards Board would be complemented by a trading of knowledge the rulemakers suggested I expect that the FASB will gain as much as it gets out of the work of IASB FASB Chairman Edmund Jenkins told the international board and his counterparts from around the world IASB Not a Dictator At the May meeting IASB Chairman David Tweedie and his colleagues sought to provide assurances that the newly restructured international panel will not usurp the authority of the national standardsetters In forging sharedwork arrangements on topics such as stockbased compensation or sharebased payments revenue recognition and consolidations policy there will be no directives to national boards to arrive a particular conclusion Tweedie suggested IASB is not a dictator Its simply a facilitator he said Earlier in the meeting Hans Havermann chairman of the German accounting standards board discussed the IASBnational boards model for working toward converging rules and stated that the autonomy and independence of the local standardsetters must remain intact In response James Leisenring a former longtime FASB member now serving on IASB suggested the model of joint projects and shared labor and research is not intended to be a threat to the autonomy of any national board The notion behind convergence he added is to put some pressure on all of us to get to the same answer and work with a spirit of cooperation That does not mean however that IASB and a national board with which it works on a particular project will be assured of arriving at the same answer Leisenring said They always have the right to reach different conclusions he said of the national boards In summarizing the May discussion on rulemakingbypartnership Tweedie said that there would be a method of resolving conflicts which he called an important issue The IASB chairman noted that rulemaking agendas of the international board and the major national standardsetters will have to be aligned Such an alignment means also that due process schedulesfor example comment periods on draft ruleswill have to be coordinated as at least one participant in the meeting suggested Tentative Listing of HighPriority Projects Besides the improvements transition and combinations project IASBs list of highpriority technical efforts includes sharebased payments or stockbased compensation a controversial project that would have an expected goal of expensing stock options DTR G reporting financial performance which IASB and FASB members have suggested could hold the key to acceptability of controversial moves toward fair value in accounting especially for financial instruments financial instruments which possibly could mean a nearterm repair of the flawed International Accounting Standard while moving more deliberately toward full fair valuebased measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities distinguishing between liabilities and equity a project similar to the pending FASB project focusing on classifying such items as mandatorily redeemable preferred securities consolidations policy or determining on what basis a company should consolidate subsidiaries it effectively controls despite lack of equity ownership a project that has bedeviled FASB for some years measurement objectives which would focus on such questions as fair value versus deprival valuethe latter an accounting concept in Great Britainas an avenue to better use of presentvaluebased methods of measurement and associated notions of discounting and estimating future cash flows DTR G revenue recognition with the related tasks of devising rules on liability recognition and possibly having to revise or devise bedrock definitions a likely prospect in the liabilitiesequity effort also insurance contracts impairment and derecognition Parts of that full plate of high priority items are expected to be taken up at IASBs next meeting in late June As described by Tweedie May the last day of the boards fourday meeting the tentative agenda for that meeting includes transition issues obviously a big issue business combinations performance reporting more agendasetting with a refining of assignment of priorities and the measurement objectives topic Asian Airlines Tender For Jet Fuel Through JetAcom Dow Jones May By Jeremy Bowden SINGAPORE All Nippon Airways Co Ltd JANA and Japan Airlines Co Ltd JAPNY are among several major airlines to have tendered for part of their jet fuel needs through a new Internet platform JetAcom according to oil traders The Internet site is backed by major airlines including the two Japanese carriers and other Asianbased airlines including Singapore Airlines Ltd PSAL Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd HCPA and Air New Zealand Ltd AAIZ The site is also backed by six major oil companies including BP PLC BP Exxon Mobil Corp XOM Chevron Corp CHV and the Royal DutchShell Group RD In total JetA estimates its backers represent of the global jet fuel market According to oil traders jet fuel is one of the most generic of oil products and as such is easier to trade through an electronic system than oil products with a greater variety of specifications such as gasoline or fuel oil Unlike most other online oil trading systems JetAcom is designed for physical trade in the form of buy and sell tenders with a facility for direct onetoone negotiation rather than derivative trade The web site however provides links to derivative trading sites as well as other physical trading sites As well as tenders airlines will also be able to make spot purchases from a variety of suppliers around the clock JetA has agreed to team up with Platts PlattsDirect system along with businesstobusiness management software company TradeCapturecom to provide its online electronic cash exchange Platts is a division of McGrawHill Cos MHP JetA estimates that of worldwide jet fuel transactions are already based on Platts price assessments and qualified trades from the JetAcom PlattsDirect system will be used in Platts own market assessments according to a JetA press release The Chicagobased site was formed Jan It also provides a data collection point for ticketing information and will maintain fuel contract and price databases Further services are expected to be launched in JetA says its site should save the airline industry up to million annually in fuel procurement costs Weak euro may be what the doctor ordered ECB WATCH Financial Times May By TONY BARBER Slower economic growth rising inflation and a tumbling euro make an unpleasant combination for the European Central Bank Each factor seems to reinforce the others As Ernst Welteke Bundesbank president observed last Friday the euros weakness has contributed to the eurozones problem with inflation over the past year Higher than acceptable inflation reduces the ECBs scope for cutting interest rates This in turn restricts economic growth especially in Germany Pessimism about the growth outlook then causes currency markets to sell the euro and the vicious circle is complete Is there any way out In the short term probably not One nasty blow for the euro was the revision this month of the widely followed Morgan Stanley Capital International equity market indices The resulting adjustments by portfolio managers could cause even more money to flow out of the euro and into other currencies than was first thought Paul Meggyesi of Deutsche Bank estimates the net outflow will be about Dollars bn higher than his initial calculation of Dollars bnDollars bn However the main beneficiary is likely to be not the dollar but sterling which Mr Meggyesi thinks will receive an inflow of Dollars bn Any further strengthening of the pound against the euro will provide food for thought for those in the eurozone as much as in the UK who are contemplating British adoption of the single currency Be that as it may it is uncertain that the ECB would accept the vicious circle diagnosis set out above The ECB is only in a bind if its objective is to cut interest rates rather than to do what it can for the economy without prejudicing its inflation objective says Nigel Anderson of the Royal Bank of Scotland This point becomes clear when one recalls that since the euros birth the ECB has always argued that real interest rates in the eurozone have been low by historical standards The ECBs main interest rate stood at per cent between April and November Coupled with oil priceinduced inflation and the falling euro the overall effect was to create a monetary policy setting that was very lax for many eurozone member states This explains the seven rate increases between November and October that took the ECBs main rate up to per cent The mild cut that the ECB finally delivered on May bringing the main rate to per cent ended up being less mild than the ECB intended Because financial markets did not like the ECBs reasoning behind the cut it triggered a fall in the euro that may ease overall monetary conditions by more than the cut itself The euros weakness does make it harder for the ECB to bring down inflation below its target ceiling of per cent a year But it also represents a monetary easing that as Mr Anderson suggests might be just what the doctor ordered for the eurozone Market suspicions that the ECB may be thinking of intervention in support of the euro may therefore be overdone For sure disorderly market conditions sometimes prompt central bank intervention But the euros latest decline has taken place in an orderly fashion It is a better tonic for the eurozone economy than a sharp rise in the currency If the ECB thinks otherwise it is up to the banks senior members to say so Central bank chief resists calls for advance distribution of euro notes Financial Times May By Peter Norman Wim Duisenberg president of the European Central Bank yesterday insisted that the changeover to euro notes and coins on January next year would be a success rejecting pleas for small denomination euro notes to be distributed to the public in advance He told the European Parliaments Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that the banks general council does not intend to change its decisions on socalled frontloading to the public at this late stage in the changeover timetable Disputing claims that all retailers wanted such a measure he pointed out that the advance distribution of euro notes to the public would upset the existing logistical plans for the changeover It would also be expensive for individuals because they would have to pay for the euro notes in national currencies yet not be able to use them before January Some retail groups especially in the Netherlands have warned of chaos on Euros day as consumers struggle to get used to the new currency and have insufficient paper money But Mr Duisenberg said the difficulties would be eased by the planned conversion of automatic teller machines to euros in the early hours of January and their loading with Euros and Euros notes He also said banks planned to open on that day in some eurozone countries while consumers should also have benefited from information campaigns that would provide details of the new notes to every household in advance The challenges with regard to the cash changeover should not be underestimated the ECB president said At the same time I am not aware of any indications that could place the effectiveness of the careful and comprehensive preparations for a smooth and successful cash changeover in doubt In a wide ranging question and answer session Mr Duisenberg also defended the ECBs recent rate reduction of per cent as consistent with the eurozones harmonised inflation rate falling below per cent next year from a rate of per cent in April declared it was not the banks policy to surprise financial markets as the last rate cut did But if the choice was between surprise or delay of a monetary policy decision he would accept surprise reaffirmed that intervention was a weapon available for use on foreign exchange markets However Mr Duisenberg stressed that the ECB would worry about the euro exchange rate only if it were to have a sizeable impact on inflationary expectations urged governments not to delay fiscal consolidation and to bring their budgets in line with the medium term goal of the EUs stability and growth pact of being close to balance or surplus Fed Chairman Warns Economic Slowdown Is Not Yet Over Further Cuts May Be Needed BNA May Further interest rate cuts may be needed in order to spur adequate economic growth but the underlying potential for the economy remains strong Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in a May speech to the Economic Club of New York The period of subpar economic growth is not yet over and we are not free of the risk that economic weakness will be greater than currently anticipated requiring further policy response Greenspan said Greenspan added however that the Federal Open Market Committees decision to cut the Federal funds rate by percentage points over the last five months are frontloaded policy actions that should be providing substantial support for a strengthening of economic activity later this year The Fed chairman warned that new investment in capital equipment is continuing to slow despite evidence that the expected rates of return on such equipment remain high Greenspan said however that he still believes we are experiencing only a pause in investment for innovations that have spurred the strongest productivity growth in more than years Greenspan also dismissed concerns that the risks of rising inflation were beginning to overshadow the slowing economy The lack of pricing power reported overwhelmingly by business people underscores an absence of inflationary zest Undoubtedly businesses are felling the effects of diminished pressures in product markets With energy inflation probably peaking and the easing of tightness in labor markets expected to damp wage increases prices seem likely to be contained Greenspan said He added that although some private sector economists have noted concerns that the rising yields for longterm Treasury notes may be signaling that the markets are worried about inflation the increase probably reflects some expectation that the decline in the supplies of outstanding marketable Treasury debt may not be as dramatic as earlier thought Responding to a question following his speech Greenspan said the Fed is not in a position to assess the likely impact of the trillion tax cut bill on FOMC policy We would observe how it affects the economy and then respond to the economy Greenspan said The tax cut bill that passed the Senate on May would provide for billion in immediate tax relief over the next two years but discussions are continuing in a HouseSenate conference committee to decide whether the money should be distributed through rebate checks changes in employer withholding or not at all Three Areas of Contention Threaten To Derail EU Effort at Economic Reform BNA May By Joe Kirwin BRUSSELSDespite several summits and numerous declarations dedicated to European Union economic reform the process launched more than a year ago in Lisbon by EU leaders to make the member states more competitive visavis the United States has hit a rocky patch in the month of May that threatens to derail a number of key initiatives Foremost among the Lisbon reform initiatives experiencing trouble is an electricity liberalization initiative Confounding that effort is a major feud between the French and Italian governments which developed because Frances stateowned national utility EdF bought a controlling stake in Italian stateowned utility Montedison Not only has the issue threatened new economic reform plans such as electricity market deregulation but it has even imperiled a fundamental EU single market tenet concerning the free movement of capital The latter is threatened due to emergency legislation passed May by Italy blocking foreign companies from purchasing Italian stateowned companies Another initiative pinpointed in Lisbon as well as in Stockholm in March at a followup economic reform summit but now facing gridlock and possible defeat is a new fasttrack approach to pass financial service legislation The other legislative initiative in trouble is a corporate takeover directive that collapsed because of disputes between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament Electricity Deregulation Issue The source of the conflict in the EU electricity deregulation issue revolves around the French governments refusal to deregulate its own electricity market while EdF is out buying up utility companies in other member states that have deregulated Even though EU leaders focused on this problem in Stockholm and called on the Commission to address the unfair situation EdF has continued on a buying spree Montedison was its most recent purchase Initially the French utility announced May its purchase of Montedison was only as a minority shareholder The Commission subsequently announced that the matter was therefore not of its concern However EdF was forced to announce May that it had in fact upped its stake and bought a controlling share in Montedison The Italian government outraged by the blatant double standard pursued by the French government and stateowned utility passed a law blocking the purchase by a foreign company of an Italian stateowned firm Commission Spokesman Andrea Dahmen stated May that the EU executive body would scrutinize the Italian legislation We will go through it carefully and see if it is in contradiction or not with existing EU law Dahmen said Existing EU law in this case is the free movement of capital Power Struggle Over Financial Services In the case of proposals for fasttrack financial service legislation based on a plan known as the Lamfalussy process the Commission and the European Parliament are in the throes of a power struggle The thrust of the Lamfulussy process is a plan that would by pass the normal EU legislative process that includes passage of legislation through the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament which usually takes at least two years That time span is considered much too long to keep up with fastmoving financial markets Instead the Lamfulussy process calls for a framework law to be passed through the normal legislative procedure but would also allow for regulations to be passed in a short period of time by two special committees However the European Parliament wants to have a recall or veto on the regulations approved by the special committees The Commission and Council of Ministers concerned that this would set a precedent for the future have rejected the EPs demand As a result the EPs Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee Chairwoman Christa RandzioPlath said May the framework law that would put the Lamfulussy process in place will be blocked If there is no agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission the Lamfalussy approach will not work said RandzioPlath There will be just the Parliament and the codecision procedure We support the goal of speeding up securities market regulation and will continue to work for a deal fully safeguarding the Parliaments rights under the codecision procedure Despite RandzioPlaths threats Internal Market Commission Frits Bolkestein said the EU executive body would move ahead and propose the framework legislation and supporting directives in June I am confident that a solution can be found Bolkestein said May But it will be impossible to give the Parliament the callback right it is seeking Corporate Takeover Directive The dispute over the corporate takeover directive is just as difficult At stake is a directive that has been in negotiation for more than years The central point of dispute concerns conditions that would allow for a hostile takeover of a company to proceed if shareholders give the goahead The EU member states finally approved the directive earlier this year that would allow for a hostile takeover But the EP is insisting that a companys board of directors be allowed a socalled poison pill that would allow them to defy shareholders and ward off a hostile takeover Led by German MEP Klaus HeinerLehne the EP is concerned that without the poison pill European companies will be easy prey for US corporate raiders The EPs cause received a major boost in the past month when German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder announced his government was backing away from its support for the Council of Ministerapproved bill Sweden which holds the EU rotating presidency rejected Germanys attempt to reopen the Council of Minister version of the corporate takeover directive However the German announcement has strengthened the EPs hand in Conciliation Committee negotiations which have been underway for more than two months If there is no agreement by June the Conciliation Committee process expires and so does the directive Therefore the Commission would have to start from scratch with a new proposal I think the chances of failure are now or percent said Lehne I have heard the Council of Minister decision They do not want to discuss defensive measures This is dictatorship of the Council Nothing more nothing less Commission Spokesman Jonathan Todd said if no agreement were reached on the corporate takeover directive it would be the EPs fault If they dont agree to the compromises the proposal will go in the bin said Todd We will have to reflect on whether to start over again In the meantime EU industry will pay the price with the harm done to the Lisbon process of restructuring and

US Equity Derivatives FOW ISDA tackles default swap successor definition IFR May The International Swaps and Derivatives Associations credit derivatives market practice committee last week moved to tackle the question of reference entity for credit default swaps in the event of a demerger With the dismantling of ATT looming the need to resolve the successor issue is heightened say industry officials who note that resolution would enhance legal certainty for the product ATTs restructuring plan calls for splitting the company into four different units and assigning the bulk of the firms massive debt burden to two of the entities Under the ISDA credit derivatives definitions the entity that assumes all or substantially all of a firms debt responsibility after a breakup should be used as the reference entity for outstanding credit default swap contracts The ATT example highlights the need for clarification because no one entity stands to assume the majority of the companys debt obligations Also ATT is one of the most heavily traded names in the credit default swap market One potential answer may be to allocate a demerging companys default protection among the newly formed companies according to the percentage of debt that each entity is allocated said credit derivatives officials in New York No historical guidance exists currently The issue first rose to prominence last year with the question of the reference entity for credit default swaps on the UKs National Power following the companys demerger International Power was eventually agreed to be the reference entity because it had to take on new debt at the time of the demerger Many end users of default swaps were unhappy with the way major dealers spun out the debate over this case however Firms representing the key participants in the credit derivatives market on June will report back to the credit derivatives market practice committee The firms consulting the marketplace include a credit derivatives dealing firm a bank portfolio manager and an end user of credit derivatives Each group has European and US representation It is unclear whether the clarification on the successor issue which will probably be released as a supplement later this summer will apply retroactively one market official said Basel comment period ends work for banks begins Reuters May By Alice Ratcliffe ZURICH May Reuters An industry comment period on new global capital rules dubbed Basel ends on Thursday but the work will just be starting for banks calculating how the sweeping changes will affect their businesses The new rules are due to be enforced in various legal jurisdictions starting in They will apply to most of the worlds banks now subject to the outmoded Basel Accord dating from Basel once adopted will also set standards for securities and brokerage firms in the European Union Despite outcry from some industry participants that the new rules were formulated too quickly supervisors appear set to complete Basel by yearend in time to implement it by according to industry sources One reason for the haste is that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision drafting the new rules worries an industry stalemate could delay adoption of the badlyneeded new rules in some key jurisdictions The implementation date is already seen as a sop to the lengthy EU legislative process Time Basel uses up eats into time for the EU directive said a source familiar with the issues adding the Basel Committee is between the devil and the deep blue sea SWEATING OVER CALIBRATION Of course that doesnt make the process any smoother Officially banks are to have all comments submitted by May Unofficial dialogues will likely continue for a long while One area of concern is Basel s approach to capital needed to cover lending exposure It allows for banks which meet certain qualifications to measure the risk of a borrower defaulting using an internal system in a way similar to an earlier advance adopted in the s is used to measure market risk In the approach to market risk banks deemed eligible by supervisors can use their own internal ValueatRisk VAR models to assess market risk to assess capital requirements Basel foresees letting eligible banks use an internal ratings based IRB approach to measure credit risk But unlike market risk banks are not allowed to use their own models to calculate the capital needed to cover credit risk at least not yet as such models are not deemed advanced enough for this Instead banks will compute their regulatory capital using their own internal ratings But they must then plug internal numbers into formulae spelled out by Basel computed on an indexed or calibrated basis This is where problems arise The first thing we said was that the calibration of the whole proposal has to be reworked said one banker Banks complain Basel s calibration formulae as spelled out in a draft published in January penalise the IRB approach saying setasides for risky corporates for example could be higher than what is called for by a standardised approach applied for less sophisticated banks One fear is that this could lead small and midsized banks using the standardised approach to wind up with a disproportionately larger exposure to riskier borrowers Supervisors are expected to work out the kinks however and are expected to take into account data collected by the Basel Committee under a Quantitative Impact Study wwwbisorg I have the strong impression there are going to be substantial changes to the document said one banker whose own institution had run simulations which took into account its profile including a large amount of emerging market loans He said the simulations showed his bank would have been seriously penalised by the earlier proposal But now it looks as though it will be changed The Basel Committee seems to be open to our point of view he said Banks are to submit findings on such technical issues to country regulators by June The Basel Committee could finish analysing these by October and is likely to incorporate them into the finished version of Basel OPERATIONAL RISK PALPITATIONS Operational risk is a new category foreseen by Basel alongside credit and market risk No one doubts that such risk exists But requiring banks to quantify it and set aside enough capital to satisfy regulators is proving another headache Some private bankers worry that asking banks to set aside capital for such risk could adversely affect the burgeoning business of wealth management which in theory requires a low capital base compared to lending or trading activities A lot of banks have gone into private banking and asset management and have paid a fortune to do so The message is they want these glamorous purchases because they need low capital and offer good returns said one European banker adding the original proposed changes move the goalposts The Basel Committee raised a storm when it suggested a capital set aside of percent a provisional figure for operational risk The final figure has not yet been set Basel defines operational risk as the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events and refers to an average of percent of economic capital Alongside smaller banks big ones are irked that the calculation ignores what one banker said was big banks more diversified income and hence reduced risk of failure Some banks would also like included in the calculation the hit absorption of a bank meaning that a bank making losses would first use income not capital as a cushion Hedge funds drive risk tool boom IFR May By Kathleen Fitzpatrick Dubbed virtual portfolios risk measurement services that include a whatif scenario along with the more traditional kind of risk analysis are gaining in importance The hypothetical feature allows for a more customised and flexible approach to the management of risk and answers situational hedging questions about a portfolio What would happen if I added a hedge into the portfolio What if I buy or sell futures are questions that Deutsche Banks dbRiskOffice scenario analysis can now address said Michelle McCarthy managing director risk analytics at Deutsche Bank Deutsches Whatif Positions Change enhancement released to clients in midMay includes features to determine changes in value at risk VAR tracking error and surplusatrisk resulting from a variety of hypothetical situations Deutsches client risk reporting system available via an internet browser specifically targets risk managers who outsource their risk measurement instead of building up an entire department to monitor their VAR Deutsches customers are keen on obtaining crossasset class VAR coverage according to McCarthy Managers who incorporate the use of the client risk reporting enhancement would have a better handle on whether a particular position will better correlate a fund to an index for example The current VAR analysis tools have already been mastered by the fund community which is now looking for better predictors of risk VAR is tied to a particular probability at present and fails to capture an exceptional move in an index for example said Guillaume Blacher senior managing director pricing advisory and risk management at Reech Capital in London Risk managers have been consistently going for greater flexibility added Deutsches McCarthy More managers want to work with the numbers rather than have a single number that comes out once a day she said referring to the benefits of scenario analysis over traditional risk measurement practices The hypothetical scenario tools along with the traditional VAR risk measurement systems are needed by fund managers in a complementary way stated Reech Capitals Blacher However the hypothetical tools give more flexibility to analyse potentially substantial losses VAR has shown its limitations it tends to capture bad days not the extremes according to Blacher Hypothetical analysis tools will assist the risk manager in deciphering what positions are needed to get back within a fund managers limit he added Option competition The need for faster and more reliable scenario hedging for managers investing in equity options has been a key driver of demand for whatif scenario analysis lately The stock option market has become tighter more competitive noted Ravi lain chief executive officer of Egar Technology a New York and Moscowbased firm that launched its own realtime equity options trading and risk management platform Equity Trading System last week We have already seen an incredible amount of interest from marketmakers moving upstairs and the hedge fund community lain said He also credits the more educated investor who may be prompting the fund manager to install better risk management and reporting systems particularly for option based funds as fuelling the current demand for hypothetical risk analysis Aside from the trading and risk management systems there is a lot of need for decision support tools he added Michael Gannon sales and marketing associate at Imagine Software the software maker that powers the Derivativescom trading site agreed that more sophisticated investors are a force behind fund manager demand for this kind of system Banks such as Deutsche Bank and Citigroup use Derivativescom risk measurement tools in their sellside operations according to Gannon And it is precisely the use by these banks that smaller Imagine Software clients like However the current risk measurement systems can be expensive for all but the largest trading organisations and especially for startup funds Hedge funds are not going to spend USm on buying a big system said Egars lain Instead he said they will investigate the more customisable decision analysis tools Imagine Software implemented its hypothetical whatif position analysis last year Its Derivativescom website features a hedge as you rehedge component that allows funds to rehedge during the simulation to give the portfolio a twodimensional realtime projection of a trade MicroHedge a webbased platform that caters to option traders also offers whatif scenario analysis in its MicroHedge Portfolio Risk product That platform however targets the needs of active marketmakers rather than hedge fund derivatives users The fact that these virtual portfolio hypothetical analysis tools are now available is beginning to make it easier for hedge funds to start up according to Imagines Cannon With the right risk analysis tools a hedge fund could be up and running in a week instead of hiring an entire IT staff he said Certainly the growth of hedge fund startups continues at rapid pace Hedge

LONDON Will too much bureaucracy cause a logjam in the City A think tank warned of growing discontent among major financial institutions with the Financial Services Authority which this year will take over the duties of all of the financial regulatory agencies in the United Kingdom and said the FSAs style eventually could undermine the international competitiveness of the City as Londons financial district is known The FSA is seen as bureaucratic intrusive and insensitive and its regulatory style risks becoming a rulesbased system for the benefit of lawyers and compliance officials according to the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation in London The conclusions which are based on interviews with officials at about financial institutions including foreign banks with large operations in the UK come as the FSA nears a stillunnamed date when it will officially replace regulators and different rule books During the past four years the FSA has been a virtual regulator that contracted some of its duties to the agencies that it will replace The FSA said the think tank which admits it began with negative preconceptions ended up with some positive conclusions For instance the study found little evidence despite many complaints that the FSAs approach has cost the Londons financial center any business Rather it found that the FSA is seen as more sophisticated than other European regulators and that new banks and companies are setting up shop in the UK at an unprecedented pace The think tank itself acknowledged that some of the institutions may be grumbling because they prefer the old regime and because the FSA isnt completely formed The think tank also warned of inexorable forces driving the City toward rulebound regulation rather than a more flexible individual approach Some respondents said they feared that the FSA may be less hospitable to innovation and startup companies The CSFI also claimed that regulatory costs are rising in most parts of the City because of higher compliance costs An FSA spokesman said the report didnt back that claim up with hard analysis and that indirect costs are included in the costbenefit analysis that the agency performs on policy proposals US Equity Derivatives FOW May By Anuszka Ranslev The economic slowdown of global markets has had a dramatic effect on the US equity derivatives market Although the underlying market is proving to be quite uncertain traders report a remarkable time for equity derivatives One trader describes this as probably the single best I environment for equity derivatives that weve seen in the last decade Compressed levels of volatility at the beginning of the year combined with uncertainty in the market has lead to an increased usage of equity y derivatives While volatility levels dropped in the first few months of the year due to supply and demand factors the past month has seen volatilities begin to move up again However one USbased broker warns that volatilities have not moved up as much as the market would expect We would predict with the current supply and demand imbalance that vols would rise more significantly than they have he says The fact that vols have not risen in this way creates good value for those looking to use equity derivatives Meanwhile there are reports of a diversity of business being traded across the board with no significant markets being favoured While February saw no signs of a herd mentality since March there has been much copycat trading going on This has lead to reports of the US leading the market with Europe and Asia following However at the beginning of April traders report some diversions from this copycat trading particularly with the Nikkei rising by several per cent Convertibles remain the core of activity in the market A dealer comments If you can get the premium high enough although people arent crazy about selling their stock at this level convertible financing is pretty viable The demand in the convertible market has lead to a significant growth of convertible arbitrage This sector has become the best performing alternative investment hedge fund strategy rising from last year with a total return of approximately The dealer warns There is a lot of new money that has moved into this arena but there are just not that many new funds and now as funds come on there arent that many convertibles available The convertible market continues to offer zeros with many large over night deals being witnessed One trader comments that The big buyers of convertibles believe that the arbitrage funds are very material to the market although they would prefer them on a hedge basis with more attractive volatility However he warns In this market of convertibles you need to be aware of where you can get stock off where the credit should be trading and where you can distribute that credit Traders report a record year so far in equity derivatives and speculate that the market is the one area in investment banking other than fixed income that is really having a good year A head of desk concludes This is a period of divergence where there is so much uncertainty in the market that it is hard to trade and hard to take

of Argentina debt swap over SEC rule fears Financial Times OTHER Newer options Business Standard Basle II Financial Times June The process of refining the Basle capital adequacy rules is drawing to a close A revised set of rules will be agreed by the end of this year to take effect in There remains broad agreement that it is about time to update the original formula for calculating how much capital a bank needs Yet there is enough disagreement on the philosophy and details of the new proposals to suggest that their implementation will be difficult and expensive Perhaps this will prove to be the spur the banking industry needed to start spending on information technology once again The old rules are straightforward enough Minimum capital requirements are set as a percentage of each banks assets with some broad categories of loan such as mortgages or government debt assigned reduced weightings The new rules are a considerable improvement in this area tying capital requirements much more closely to the actual risk posed by individual loans Oddly though exceptional treatment is preserved for German real estate loans But if the measurement of credit risk becomes more sophisticated the addition of other worse defined categories of risk notably operational risk restores much of the crudeness of the original agreement It would be worth taking more time to reach agreement on the right way of measuring operational risk But political realities notably the length of time needed to get an updated European capital adequacy directive to incorporate the new rules mean that this is unlikely to happen The result is that Basle II will prove to have a much shorter shelf life than Basle I Australias APRA says Basel home loan rules unfair Reuters June By Marion Rae SYDNEY June Reuters Australias bank regulator said on Monday it believed proposed reforms to global capital adequacy requirements by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision could introduce competitive inequalities in the Australian market In particular proposals for capital backing for the residential mortgage market a dominant and low risk area of business for Australian institutions needed to be modified the Australian Prudential Regulation Authoritys APRA general manager of risk analysis Wayne Byers told Reuters The Basel committee has proposed that exposures secured by residential property attract a percent risk weighting the same as the current weight but large institutions able to follow new internal ratingsbased guidelines would be able to reflect the very low housing loss experience in Australia with a cheaper risk weighting of five to percent Within the proposed accord there are three methods by which banks can calculate capital charges for credit risk a standard method which is a variant on the current method and a further two methods one simple and one advanced where banks use their own internal ratings systems as a means of allocating capital Overall the more advanced the method you use there are some quite significant capital savings Byers said The more sophisticated methods arent restricted to big banks but obviously they have the knowledge the resources and the data and that means that theyre more likely to pursue them As a percentage of total assets as at March APRA said housing loans amounted to an average of percent for Australias major banks including National Australia Bank Ltd Commonwealth Bank of Australia Westpac Banking Corp and the ANZ Banking Group Ltd and percent for regional banks BIG BANKS STAND TO GAIN Given that the minimum requirement is an eight percent capital ratio banks have to have A which is percent for every A of housing loans they make he said It would stay the same for those banks that stay on the simplest method but for those banks which move on to methods where they use their own internal measures of risk a much lower number is produced he said Theyre based on an international average but Australian data shows it up to be a much lower risk activity he said APRA has proposed lowering the standardised housing risk weighting to percent or allowing individual countries to allow a weighting lower than Basel requirements where historical loss rates and market characteristics made this appropriate I dont think the committee envisaged the big gaps that have turned out so I would expect they would certainly look to reduce those gaps between the different methods Im less sure that they will deal with productlevel issues Byers said Housing loans in Australia are a very low risk activity theyre not necessarily that in other markets where housing prices are volatile and where banks dont necessarily use conservative LVR loantovalue rates he said Capital adequacy rules in Australia required LVRs of less than percent unless backed by mortgage insurance It may be that we have to do something ourselves to tackle that issue The final proposals will be out at the end of the year and were waiting to see how they look before we commit ourselves to any action Byers said Asia May Not Be Ready For New Basel Pact Ctrl Bankers Dow Jones International News June SINGAPORE APAsian central bankers Saturday said their countries may not be ready for the Bank of International Settlements new Capital Accord planned for In particular infrastructure and internal capacities in some member countries could limit their ability to fully implement the accord by then the Governors of the Southeast Asian Central Banks said in a communique after a twoday meeting in Singapore Asias financial meltdown rocked banks and economies worldwide drawing intense international pressure for reform among Asian financial institutions The Basel based Bank for International Settlements or BIS hopes to implement by its new Capital Accord which would give banking regulators more power to assess whether banks have the capital to weather bad loans The BIS acts as the banker for central banks providing financial services for managing their external reserves The new Basel accord poses challenges to Asian banks and regulators Singapores second minister for finance Lim Hng Kiang said earlier in opening remarks at the Singapore conference Asian banks would have to develop more sophisticated risk management capability under the new accord and regulators would need to build up technical knowledge to handle the accord Lim said in the opening speech The Asian central bankers also said in their communique that there is a need to use policies that prevent excessive exchange rate volatility which can have severe consequences for small open economies Central bank representatives at the Singapore meeting came from Indonesia South Korea Malaysia Mongolia Myanmar Nepal the Philippines Singapore Sri Lanka Taiwan and Thailand The meeting also included observers from Cambodia Fiji Laos Papua New Guinea Tonga and Bruneis Ministry of Finance Basel Accord Gets Chilly Reception The Asian Wall Street Journal June By Jason Booth The international banking community has given its opinion on the new Basel Capital Accord But it isnt encouraging Over the last five months bankers from around the world have been submitting views on the accord dubbed Basel which is designed to set the benchmark for bank operations and risk management By replacing the original Basel Accords the new agreement aims to promote better allocation of the money banks must put aside for bad loans through the use of more scrupulous risk analysis On Friday reaction to the new pact was made public on the Web site of the Bank for International Settlements The Basel Switzerland organization which promotes cooperation among central banks authored the accord Big banks called the plan too conservative while smaller institutions said it will increase their cost of capital and warned it could deepen the divide between rich and poor nations Most felt the regulations were onerously complex and that the planned launch date was too ambitious The Institute of International Finance a private association of the worlds biggest banks based in Washington weighed in Friday with perhaps the most influential assessment The proposal includes at every step of the creditassessment process an element of conservatism said Jan Kalff chairman of the IIF steering committee on Basel and former chairman of ABN Amro Bank who was on a visit to Hong Kong While the riskanalysis procedures mandated by Basel might lower the amount of money some banks need to set aside for bad loans those savings would be offset by added costs the IIF said The hiring and training of new staff new software and a general slowing down of the lending process would generate those costs Some bankers have mentioned to me that the costs are going to be of the same magnitude as YK implementations But YK was only oneoff this will be a year after year costly thing said Mr Kalff The IIF report estimated a total cost to banks of trillion over five years Mr Kalff added that such costs wouldnt be incurred by nonbanking financial institutions giving them a competitive advantage against traditional banks Asian central bankers Saturday said their countries may not be ready for the BIS accord In particular infrastructure and internal capacities in some member countries could limit their ability to fully implement the accord by then the Governors of the Southeast Asian Central Banks said after a twoday meeting in Singapore Meanwhile smaller banks especially those in the developing world had other concerns over the Basel draft The proposed approach will result in fostering or even deepening the division into highly developed and underdeveloped countries both with respect to external funding and capital costs wrote Leszek Balcerowicz of the Polish Commission for Bank supervision The problem for emergingmarket banks is that their client base typically has lower credit ratings than those of major banks do As such under the new rules these banks will have set aside a greater portion of their capital to cover possible losses If they dont they will be punished by higher costs when they borrow money in international capital markets And borrowers especially smaller and less creditworthy ones will likely pay the price with higher capital costs Again lessdeveloped nations are likely to suffer most since higher capital costs could slow development of higherrisk small and midsize enterprises One complaint shared by big and small banks was Basel s insistence that banks be more widely reviewed by creditrating agencies to determine asset risk In addition to expressing concerns over the added costs of this policy some felt it would be counterproductive The increasing reliance on external rating agencies would undermine the initiatives of banks in enhancing their riskmanagement policies and practices and internal control said the Reserve Bank of India There was also a general call for more physical collateral such as property and accounts receivable to be factored into banks credit risks There is ample evidence to show that such collateral is effective in mitigating risk said Mr Kalff of the IIF In light of such wideranging concerns many felt that it would be difficult to meet Basel s scheduled launch date The IIF felt that parts of the accord would require at least to months of further negotiations even though the BIS has been hoping to finalize the accord by the end of this year Developing nations suggested that the accord be phased in over a longer period of time In the words of Adrian Byrne of the Central Bank of Ireland This time frame is still too short given the range of information not available Derivatives industry IFR June Derivatives industry officials are optimistic that some of their criticisms of the draft of the new Basle II Capital Accord will be taken on board by regulators They believe there is a good chance that their input on the calibration of the internal ratingsbased function will result in a change in the accord for example However there is no sign yet that their input on the W factor charge on credit derivatives will result in a revision The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision will next month release exposure drafts on operational risk and the internal ratings based approach for treatment of equities retail portfolios project finance and securitisation as areas for additional consultation and interim papers for its new global capital adequacy rule proposals dubbed Basle II These were all green areas when the consultation came out in January said a Bank for international Settlements official It still remains unclear whether the W factor will be eliminated he noted There are some strong proponents for it on the committee So it depends on the nature of the comment letters he said William McDonough the chairman of the Basle Committee is widely viewed as having backed away from the keeping the W charge in the new accord but Oliver Page the head of regulatory policy at the UK Financial Services Authority and a member of the committee is believed to remain a proponent Page said that he is keeping an open mind about the issue however This is a genuine consultation process we have got to weigh up the contributions he said last Friday the day after the deadline for comments on the new accord passed The W charge is a levy on credit derivatives when they are used for credit risk mitigation by banks which contrasts with the zero weighting given to guarantees The BISs strategy of weeding out measures that require more attention is aimed at enabling the regulator to push ahead with certain issues and finish formulating its positions on others while keeping to its deadline for implementing the new rules the BIS official said The last thing that they want to do is push ahead with everything and then reopen structural issues said Simon Gleeson a partner at Allen Overy in London On the flip side keeping everything on hold would make it impossible for it to work within its deadline he added As far as the European Union is concerned the problem that they face is the timing It took seven years to get the last Basle Accord through and into directive form The idea that the EUs implementation will get finished by is absurd a derivatives industry consultant in London said The challenge is exacerbated by the fact that when the EU writes directives they apply to all financial institutions not just internationally active banks This means that in addition to implementing the new rules it will have to draw lines between institutions and decide how to ensure that the system does not put small and mediumsized institutions at a disadvantage The Fed wants to start enforcing new rules as soon as possible If they do we will get a situation in which we have two completely different capital adequacy systems the consultant added The start of was set as a compromise due date between the US Federal Reserve and the UKs Financial Services Authority for enforcing the new rules Basle IIs initial industry comment period closed last Thursday The International Swaps and Derivatives Association focused its criticisms on three areas It argued that the introduction of rigid capital floors would increase costs that the proposed operational risk and W factor charges are arbitrary and that the proposed calibration of the internal ratings based function does not reflect market practice The accord takes significant steps toward defining an approach to setting banks capital requirements which is risksensitive granular and flexible yet there are several areas that are inconsistent with the overall goals of the accord and existing bank best practices said Emmanuelle Sebton head of risk management for ISDA ISDA officials are due to meet the FSAs Page and other members of the capital group within the Basle Committee in New York in mid July at which stage ISDA will press the case for abandonment of the W factor charge on use of credit derivatives Convertible default swap proposal near IFR June An informal working group within the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations credit derivatives market practice group is nearing the completion of a preliminary proposal aimed at creating standardised documentation for swaps based on convertible bonds and zero coupon convertible issues The surge in convertible and zero coupon convertible issuance this year and the trend towards stripping the equity and credit components out of large issues are heightening the need for the documentation Right now there isnt a standard Thats the problem Each firm uses different language Resolving this will enhance liquidity in an already wellfunctioning market said Derek Smith head of credit derivatives trading at Goldman Sachs in New York Credit derivatives market participants would benefit from standardisation as it would improve liquidity If you strip a convertible with one dealer and want to unwind with another dealer you might come across dealers that dont like the documentation So they are unlikely to bid and you are forced to go back to the first dealer said John Tierney head of credit derivatives research at Deutsche Bank in New York Even though only a portion of investment grade convertibles are stripped and stripping typically covers between a third and a quarter of a stripped convertible the activity still generates vast amounts of credit default swaps business On a USbn issue for instance in excess of USm can be stripped which is time consuming to offset given that credit default swaps usually trade in USm blocks Standard documentation is also needed because stripping often causes a jump in the price of the issuers single name credit default swap Its more technical than controversial Creating documentation that works is the challenge said Smith Before the groups proposal is available for general use it will need to be approved by ISDAs documentation committee and vetted by the industry Credit Derivatives Market To Hash Out Successor Issues Dow Jones June By Joe Niedzielski NEW YORK Dow Jones Credit derivatives professionals are working on a solution to the vexing question of how these contracts should be treated when companies spin off units or restructure into separate entities These demerger or successor issues are expected to take some months to resolve and the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations new subcommittee of the credit derivatives market practice group has given the question priority among a host of other longterm issues Adding some momentum to the discussions is the pending restructuring of ATT Corp T ATT is among the more activelytraded credits in the single name credit default swap market These overthecounter derivatives contracts let buyers transfer the default risk on loans or bonds by selling it to a third party for a premium thats derived from the notional amount of the contract ATTs plan first unveiled last fall would split the company into a business and consumer longdistance unit as well as broadband and wireless units ATT is expected to go ahead with the plan in the coming months People seem motivated about resolving this said one credit derivatives official in New York As ATT gets closer I would imagine that would galvanize people further on this side of the Atlantic When companies split up spin off units or demerge the successor entities are allocated different portions of the previous entities outstanding debt obligations and publiclyissued bonds ISDAs document governing credit derivatives essentially calls for the default swap to follow the entity that takes on the majority of the obligations in a merger consolidation or transfer This all or substantially all clause in the documentation though can be interpreted differently in other legal jurisdictions And that could pose a problem if a market participant has contracts on a particular credit with US and English counterparties Still Fallout From National Power A number of market participants are attempting to negotiate a resolution to default swaps written on the UKs National Power PLC which demerged late last year In the split Innogy Holdings PLC IOG received the former companys UKbased power and generating assets National Power changed its name to International Power PLC IPR and took the international power assets Innogy Holdings was also allocated with about of the former companys debt obligations and about of its public bonds International Power kept about of the former companys debt obligations and about of its public bonds The credit derivatives official in New York said there are theoretical ways of hashing out the successor issue One possible approach would be to have multiname default swaps after a demerger for participants that held contracts on the single name corporate prior to the demerger Essentially the trade would be split into a series of trades on the demerged entities though it would likely be difficult to calculate the relevant notional amounts that should be allocated among those new default swaps this person said Two banks pull out of Argentina debt swap over SEC rule fears Financial Times Jun By Thomas Catan Two investment banks unexpectedly pulled out of managing Argentinas record debt exchange yesterday because of worries they may have violated US securities regulations placing at risk millions of dollars in fees On the advice of their lawyers Deutsche Bank and ABNAmro yesterday withdrew from a group of banks chosen by the Argentine government to manage the multibillion dollar transaction It is understood that Banco de Galicia an Argentine bank will also exclude itself from offering the bonds in the US People close to the banks said company lawyers had become concerned that some pieces of research in the runup to the transaction may have breached US securities regulations A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington would neither confirm nor deny it had warned investment banks In an effort to buy time to restart its struggling economy Argentina hopes to exchange bonds coming due before for longerdated paper The government stopped taking offers from bondholders yesterday and is due to announce the results of the massive operation on Monday Market analysts expect the government will succeed in swapping around Dollars bn by far the largest transaction of its type If that is the case the group of investment banks would earn Dollars m which is considered to be a juicy fee for relatively light work However concerns that the Chinese wall between analysts and sales people had been breached may have cost several banks their share of the fees Some bankers suggested it was not the SEC that had raised the initial objection but rather investment banks threatening each other to maximise their proportion of the fees According to an Argentine official the problem first came to light on Thursday after questions were raised about a research report by Deutsche Banks emerging markets analysts California Clash Over PowerGrid Control The Wall Street Journal May By Rebecca Smith As California politicians wade deeper into the energy crisis the states electricgrid operator appears headed toward a showdown with federal energy regulators over whether its board is independent enough The California Independent System Operator Friday bowed to pressure from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and submitted its qualifications to continue as a federally sanctioned grid operator But the tardy filing is almost certain to be challenged by federal regulators and market participants because the ISOs governance structure has strayed from a bedrock requirement that it be independent of control by any market participant The market participant casting the long shadow is the state of California Since January when the state of California began buying huge sums of electricity on behalf of its nearly broke utilities the ISO has been under pressure to give state officials preferential treatment and unique access to marketsensitive information Its chief operations officer paid a year according to the most recent IRS filing is on indefinite loan to the governors office where he is working as an energy adviser This politicization of the ISO is significant because the organizations purpose is to run a market for power needed to keep the electric system in balance and to give buyers and sellers impartial access to the power lines on which they depend to move electricity Unlike other commodities electricity cant be stored Transactions therefore depend completely on instantaneous access to the electric superhighway of highvoltage lines The FERC worries that a loss of political independence by the ISO will further degrade the states already dysfunctional energy market The FERC hasnt formally accused the ISO of acting improperly but it is clear that a wall between the state and the ISO that once was solid has become permeable Last month the ISO notified the FERC that the state of California had asserted it must have access to the ISO control room floor and nonpublic information as a necessary condition of continuing to buy power even though such preferential access violates ISO rules But without the state to back power purchases it has spent nearly billion on electricity since January the ISOs market would collapse and blackouts and chaos likely would ensue The governance issue which may appear esoteric actually cuts to the heart of the power crisis in California State officials feel they have ceded too much control to the FERC which they accuse of shirking its duty to protect consumers As a consequence the state has forced its way into the inner workings of the formerly arcane ISO a publicbenefit corporation formed three years ago amid Californias push to deregulate its electricity market In January the state legislature authorized the governor to eject a FERCapproved board of directors and hand pick his own fivemember ISO board The state attorney general ordered old board members to resign or face personal fines of Currently one ISO board member is a former member of the governors staff while another on the governors behalf negotiated the proposed purchase of utility transmission assets by the state all the while serving as chairman of the supposedly independent board The ISOs chairman says changes in the board structure have made the ISO more answerable to the citizenry and efficient Michael Kahn who is a San Francisco attorney added that the governance structure had to change to reflect the fact that were in a state of emergency In its filing Friday the ISO took the position that the tighter relationship between the ISOs board and the state doesnt violate the FERCs requirement that ISO boards be free of control by market participants Even though the state has been required to provide financial support the ISO asserts this participation does not make the State a market participant Many market watchers scoff at that contention Inevitably this will lead to a showdown said N Beth Emery former general counsel of the ISO and now an energy attorney for Ballard Spahr Andrews Ingersoll in Washington DC Clearly the ISO is in violation of the independence requirement But the FERC doesnt have many tools for enforcing its vision of autonomy That may explain why it has failed to intervene It can order the ISO to make board changes for instance But if it refuses there may not be much the FERC can do except threaten to rescind the ISOs operating tariffs That of course is the opposite of what the FERC wants to do which is encourage creation of multistate grid organizations free of any political favoritism But Californias angry isolationism appears to be growing Gov Gray Davis said the ISOs filing ensured the state will maintain control of our own energy destiny and not be subject to the whims of federal regulators or the interests of other states To date the FERC has been steadfast in its resolve to make regional grid operators independent organizations free of control of utilities and power marketers It has rejected other gridoperator proposals because it felt utilities that owned the power lines were attempting to retain too much control But Order the landmark decision issued in December that promoted the creation of independent grid runners throughout the nation never contemplated a state government assuming such a huge role in a market as has occurred in California If anything that role is likely to increase Not only is the state of California the biggest power buyer in the nation now but it has formed a power authority that intends to build and operate generating plants In addition Mr Davis is promoting a plan to buy the transmission systems of the states investorowned utilities As such a new vertically integrated utility is forming that could be larger than any the nation has seen since the power trusts of the s were broken apart by Congress It is rife with conflicts of interest The ISOs drift has created a fissure in the solid support it enjoyed from the states big utilities that transferred control of their transmission systems to the ISO in PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co unit which is in bankruptcy proceedings declined to join the ISO filing which was supported by Edison Internationals Southern California Edison unit and Sempra Energys San Diego Gas Electric Co unit PGE said in a separate gridplan filing that it would prefer the ISO join a multistate grid organization It expressed reservations about the independence of the current board Opposition to the states influence is becoming more vocal The Electric Power Supply Association a trade group representing power producers warned FERC last month that the ISO has become a partisan advocate for the State of California and sought FERC intervention to defend the rights of all market interests Newer options Business Standard June By Gaurav Dua In addition to the numerous advantages of derivatives in terms of risk management price discovery and instruments for providing the required leverage to the investor options are also very effectively used as a tool to develop and structure innovative products Investment bankers use various form of options including call put exotic binary and so on to structure products for retail investors Such products have gained immense popularity in developed markets like the US and Europe In fact structured products offered by investment banks like Salomon Smith Barney SSB Goldman Sachs and others are also actively traded at the Chicago Board Options Exchange CBOE These relatively new investment vehicles are similar to call or put options as they have an expiration date and are cash settled like index options The capital markets division at CBOE assesses the concept behind the instrument and provides regulatory guidance before the product is offered in the market One of the very successful and popular examples of structured products is capital protected notes where the return on investment is linked to the performance of certain indices basket of stocks or a single stock in a given time frame Here the investment bank or intermediaries will calculate the present value of riskfree interest that can be earned on the capital and use it to buy call options The best part of the instrument is that there is no risk of capital loss And the risk of the investor is only limited to the interest that could have been earned on the capital This apart exotic options like knockin or knockout options where the expiry of the option is based on certain conditions are utilised to provide flexibility and additional features to the investors For instance structured products such as Target Trust Warrants offered by SSB guarantees an assured return of six per cent with no risk to the capital and investor can opt for redemption before the expiry date But there is a cap on the maximum amount of return that can be earned on the deposit A typical example of index based structured product is Equity based notes by SSB where the returns to the investor is based on the appreciation in Dow Jones Industrial Average in a given time frame This product is actively traded on CBOE In the Indian context structured products could very well fill in the gap between the high risk high return equity investments and low risk low return fixed deposits by banks The drop of basis in the interest rate on popular investment avenues such as public provident fund national saving certificate and others has already compelled the small investors to look at others investment alternatives for higher returns In such a scenario structured products are expected to do well in India Structured products could turn out to be a boon for numerous software professionals who were unable to cashin on their employee stock option ESOP in the bullrun due to the lockin period Investments bankers could target such professionals with customised structured products using put options says Sanjiv Mehta chief executive officer derivative segment

DOCUMENTATION Alternative Investment Group Blasts ISDA Derivatives Week RISK MANAGEMENT Basle relaxes operational risk rules IFR WEATHER DERIVATIVES Rainfall Derivatives IFR Heavy default swap flow Invensys fears IFR September Credit default swap quotes drove out last week on heavy trading volume A rush to buy protection was met with sellers taking profits on existing short positions or offsetting CDO exposure and as many as trades a day were seen though deal size was often USm rather than the standard USm The widening in quotes for airlines continued to draw attention and most trades referencing airlines required payment of an upfront premium of as much as of the notional total of the trade The most pressing threat of default may be in a company which is not directly affected by the terrorist attacks however A possible breach on a loan covenant test next week by UK engineering company Invensys could prompt a debt restructuring and the first substantial exercise of default swaps seen in Europe traders said Invensys shares collapsed last week on concerns about its debt burden and the price of its default swaps shot up There were fiveyear trades seen at bp and bp before bids jumped to bp then bp An offer of bp was available last Thursday before being pulled on Friday lnvensys fiveyear default swaps were trading at lObp as recently as early August and around the Obp mark earlier in the year Traders say that swaps with a notional volume of over USbn are outstanding on Invensys and with the price of its secondary debt already around and set to fall further there could be substantial payouts if a debt restructuring triggers default swap exercises The overall default swap market was functioning well last week with marketmakers posting twoway prices albeit at wide bidoffer spreads The missed lease payment by Continental Airlines has yet to trigger any swap exercise though fears remain that a major airline will default and traders are worried that US airline managers may find filing for Chapter bankruptcy and a shelter from their debts an attractive option This has led to demands for upfront premium payments on any new US airline default swap trades Dealers have been asking for USm payment on a USm trade to ensure that some money has been gathered in the event that a default is only weeks away The trades then feature a reduced premium of bp or so for a midterm deal paid on the usual basis of an annual fee paid quarterly A rare example of a straightforward US airline default swap last week was a fiveyear deal in American Airlines at bp British Airways dealt at least as high as bp in the fiveyear Hotel sector quotes were hit hard with Hilton trading at least as high as bp in the fiveyear and prices rose in every sector GMAC traded at lObp in the fiveyear and Ford at least as high as bp while DaimlerChrysler quotes rose above bp Telecoms company default swaps which have been among the worst performing this year bucked last weeks trend by holding down relative to other sectors Dealers think telecoms companies may benefit from increased demand if business travel is cut Alternative Investment Group Blasts ISDA Derivatives Week September The Managed Funds Association an alternative investment trade group with members has slammed the International Swaps and Derivatives Association for ignoring a series of letters and emails in which it outlined to the derivatives industry body concerns over proposed changes to the ISDA master agreement The MFA is worried that changes to the documentation will heavily favor sellside firms In several letters and emails the most recent dated April MFA President John Gaine told ISDA that three of the eight proposed amendments to the master agreement disproportionately favor dealers to the detriment of end users and may have the unintended consequence of increasing as opposed to decreasing systemic risk ISDA said Gaine did not respond Robert Pickel ISDA executive director in New York conceded that ISDA never directly responded to the MFAs letters but asserts the association addressed the MFAs concerns at an August meeting in Washington Weve tried to address everyones concerns said Pickel adding that those MFA concerns that were not addressed now would likely be revisited in the next months when ISDA considers revamping the entire master agreement However the MFA disputes this interpretation ISDA is drafting this from the dealers side They werent looking to sit down with us and work things out complained Pat McCarty MFA general counsel in Washington He continued ISDA dont even have the decency to send us a written response Weve gone to the trouble of writing a letter to them and theyve thumbed their nose at us I wonder if they even really care about customers ISDA which began a review of the master agreement last year was expected to begin the protocol process this week but as of last Thursday was leaning toward pushing it back a few weeks in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the US The protocol process will entail ISDA working with dealers and end users to incorporate amendments into its trade agreements Not every end user shares the MFAs sense of injustice William Miller independent risk oversight officer for the End Users of Derivatives Council of the Association of Financial Professionals which organized the August meeting in Washington said he is very encouraged by the attention ISDA paid to end user concerns at the August meeting He added that ISDA is beginning to realize that in the future it needs to consider end users before it begins drafting changes Basle relaxes operational risk rules IFR September The more flexible stance on operational risk included in the Basle Committee on Banking Supervisions soontobe released discussion paper on Basle IIs operational risk charge is set to go down well with banks In the paper the overall capital charge is lower and the advanced approach has been opened up to allow banks to use an internal lossdistribution approach or scorecard analysis for operational risk It is not as prescriptive about inputs for operational risk Its more like market risk said an official at the Bank for International Settlements noting that certain criteria will have to be met It will be up to national supervisors to judge banks internal methodologies he said The paper will be released before the end of the week Rather than settle on a benchmark figure for the industry the Committees paper will offer a temporary benchmark for illustrative purposes The temporary benchmark will be based on an analysis of economic capital data from the quantitative impact study conducted earlier this year A proposal for the level of the floor will be included in the discussion paper the official said declining to elaborate The BIS announced in June that the proposed capital accords operational risk charge would be reduced after many banks submitted comment letters stating that their internal capital models for operational risk are far lower than The Basle proposals operational risk charge resulted from an industry poll undertaken last year Many banks participating in the survey used a broad definition of operational risk and as such overstated the amount of capital allocated to the risk Rainfall Derivatives Derivatives Week September Despite the high exposure of businesses to rainfall risk most weather derivatives that have been traded have been based on a temperature indices Nevertheless many end users such as farmers or hydroelectric generators are sensitive to rainfall magnitude and frequency The consequences of too much or not enough rain are spread widely and directly or indirectly we all suffer from abnormal rainfall magnitudes A typical difficulty with risk analysis based on rainfall is that the magnitude and the frequency of rainfall strongly depend on the site where it is measured whereas the temperature is a more ambient measure By way of example if at Heathrow the temperature is C then you can assume that the temperature in central London is near C However even if it rains heavily in Heathrow you cannot assume that it will rain simultaneously in central London There is a high positive probably it does but it is not Until now rainfall process studies have been limited to either cumulative rain over a given period mainly monthly and yearly or on the rainfall process over a small time period such as every five or six minutes The first topic is quite limited and lacks interest for weather derivatives purposes The second one is very detailed but irrelevant for market transactions Instead of statistically analysing the rain it may be preferable to simulate it Only Heathrow data are used from now on Frequency The first step in building a stochastic rainfall process is to understand with which probability rainfall occurs Figure presents the historical frequency rainfall at Heathrow The frequency curve is not symmetric and a sinusoidal function might be inadequate to fit it A smoothing process can be used to correct erratic values smooth line Subsequent results are strongly dependent on these probabilities thus the extraction must be done cautiously The Rainfall Persistence The probability that it rains depends on the day of the year But does it also depend on the past Without doubt in the case of Heathrow it appears that when the weather is dry the following day is more likely to be dry than rainy and vice versa So the probability that it rains is conditional on the past But the probability that it rains depends on the time of year As a consequence it is more likely to rain two consecutive days during wintertime than in summertime and the reverse in summertime Therefore a natural autocorrelation is created which interferes with a possible true autocorrelation The model of the persistence of rain is set hereafter We note Xt the event it rains at day t Xt is Bernoulli distributed Where is for the event it rains We know the historical mean of Xt from our first studies However this is insufficient to model the time series Xt As a matter of fact assuming the independence of Xt we have EXt Xt Xt Xt EXt pt which is different from EHXt the operator EH is for the historical mean Therefore the probability pt has a time dependent expectation and is conditional to Xt Xt Xt A recurrence is produced to estimate the order of this lag dependence The probability pt is assumed to be given by pt ProbXt Xt Xt Xt Xtk with k IN The aim is to extract the minimum value of k that produces the best fit of the distribution of the length of period of rain Considering a day year we assume that Ept Ept which means that the climate does not vary over years We first estimate conditional probabilities with k then simulate the process and compare the simulated distribution of the length of the period to the smoothed historical one Then the method is reproduced with higher values of k until no more information on the probability pt is added Assuming independence between successive rainy days we have simulated the rainfall below using the historical probability for years the same length of period from which the graph below has been calculated Supposing k a good fit is already obtained The Magnitude Process Once the length of the rainy period is known the intensity of the rainfall must be evaluated for each day The previous study didnt reveal a dependence on the length of the rainy period But studies show that there is a dependence on the length of the period Since the average conditional to the previous day is different the distribution is certainly different Only four events can be enumerated for a rainy day t under the assumption k Rt Rt Rt or NRt Rt Rt or Rt Rt NRt or NRt Rt NRt with Rt the event it rains at day t and NRt the event no rain at day t Four distributions for each day of the year should be estimated In order to reduce estimation bias errors a day period bracketing the day for which the distributions are worked out is considered The main characteristics are summarised in this table The four distributions are very different from each other The average resp maximum between the event Rt Rt Rtand NRt Rt NRt is approximately divided by resp One can conclude that the distribution of the magnitude of rainfalls depends on the immediate past and future Doing the same for each day of the year all the required information to run the simulations properly is eventually obtained First all the rainy days are simulated and then the magnitude of rain is randomly generated using the correct distribution between the four possible ones for each day Conclusion Rainfall magnitude is extremely dependent upon the location where it is measured This risk can be as high as in a single month for close locations approximately miles Because the probability that it rains is nonconstant during a whole year this phenomenon creates a natural autocorrelation in the process This pitfall has to be avoided and the rainfall process can be decompounded into two steps The first stage is the frequency process and the second stage is the magnitude given the frequency In order to know the distribution of the rainfall magnitude it is just as important to know if it rained the previous day as if it will rain the next day End of ISDA Press Report for September THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS

Clearinghouses Diversify or Die Appliederivativescom FASB to Issue for Comment Securitizations Guidance on Derivatives BNA September NORWALK ConnThe Financial Accounting Standards Board Sept approved plans to publish guidance on an issue in which rules on derivatives accounting meet those for securitizations However the accounting pronouncement is effectively held in abeyance so that the public can make comments on it as part of FASBs due process The guidance pertains to beneficial interests that arise in securitization transactions subject to FASB Statement No rules on transfers of financial assets that superseded FASB Statement No More specifically the key provisions at issue would more clearly state which beneficial interests meet the definition of a derivative under FASB Statement No Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its amended version FASB Statement No That guidance which FASB tentatively decided to propose as part of a forthcoming technical corrections project on derivatives issues would replace Derivatives Implementation Issue No D on the application of Statement to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets Neel Foster and others on FASB spoke of the planned guidance as an improvement over Issue No D which was devised with the assistance of FASBs Derivatives Implementation Group FASBs staff proposed the reading of derivatives accounting rules as they pertain to beneficial interests as staff guidance Although he supported the substance of the guidance Foster said It clearly is an amendment of and that warrants FASBs full due process Others on the board such as John Wulff and Katherine Schipper agreed FASB Chairman Edmund Jenkins spoke of the importance of issuing timely guidance and therefore supported a compromise devised in exchanges with Foster to issue guidance on beneficial interests that meet the definition of a derivative in the technical corrections effort that would be limited to issues stemming from the use of FASB Statements No and In that way what Foster argued was a substantive change worthy of due process reserved for a proposed amendment to a standard would be floated for wide public comment The timetable for technical corrections project is yet to be determined In the meantime the proposed accounting prescription is to be posted soon at FASBs site on the World Wide Web Language on Beneficial Interests as Derivatives Under the proposed guidance that was less controversial FASBs staff described which beneficial interests are eligible for the scope exception under paragraph of Statement No in other words which beneficial interests arising in securitizations would not be accounted for as derivatives On which beneficial interests meet the definition of a derivatives under paragraph of FASB No the staff proposed If there is any initial net investment in a forwardbased contract the contract would not meet the criterion in paragraph b However if a forward based contract has a de minimis initial net investment that represents compensation for terms that are more or less favorable than market conditions an entity may choose to account for such a contract as either a hybrid instrument that must be bifurcated into a debt host and a derivatives whose initial fair value is zero or a derivative in its entirety An optionsbased contract that involves an initial net investment that is equal to the fair value of the option would meet the criterion in paragraph b Victoria Lusniak a FASB staff accountant suggested that if the guidance is finalized or the change otherwise is made existing DIG guidance would be affected Issue No A on prepaid interest rate swaps would be superseded Issue No E on the shortcut method after a purchase business combination would be modified and Issue No B would have to undergo minor changes Lusniak said DIG Issues Cleared In other business at FASBs Sept meeting the board did not object to seven DIG issues or items of guidance developed with the help of the group which is moribund Those include issues on the definition of a derivative scope exceptions hedges of fair value cash flow and foreign currency The items are to be posted on FASBs Web site as final cleared guidance on Oct said Robert Wilkins a FASB project manager heading up the derivatives accounting effort A DIGrelated topic that generated the most debate was a proposal by Wulff to reconsider Issue No C the result of earlier rulemaking on options and forward contracts with optionality features to weigh exempting those derivatives from FASB No because they are deemed part of normal purchases or normal sales Such derivatives are used by energy companies However by a vote of to with Wulff dissenting the board rejected that course Separately at the Sept meeting FASB extended the comment deadline to Oct for two pending items that have been floated before the boards constituents and other interested parties One item is a tandem proposal to possibly add two topicson performance reporting and disclosures about intangible assetsto its rulemaking agenda The other is a survey of the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Council on what standardsetting projects should be undertaken by FASB The deadlines were extended because of the terrorist attacks of Sept which FASB in its first meeting since the tragedy marked with a moment of silence for the victims CFTC Offers Temporary Regulatory Reprieve in Wake of Terrorist Attacks BNA September The Commodity Futures Trading Commission moved Sept to salve some of the functional sting from the Sept attacks on New Yorks financial district by announcing a package of regulatory relief aimed at giving registrants extra time to meet normally mundane commission requirements The CFTC said that for all registrantsincluding futures commission merchants introducing brokers commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisorsit will not consider Sept Sept as business days for the purposes of calculating and meeting specific reporting and capital requirements as well as bulk transfer obligations and records inspection requirements The delay effectively extends those reporting deadlines Furthermore firms that were physically disrupted as a consequence of the attacks and thus unable to make certain calculations concerning segregated funds and secured amounts have been excused from that obligation for those four days Such damaged firms also will not have the four days counted against them as either business or calendar days for purposes of confirmation statements transaction applications and position closeout requirements the CFTC said Additionally such firms will be excused for days from requirements that their records be readily accessible Collateral Consequences Though trading in most futures and options contracts resumed two days after the Sept attack the CFTC said relief was necessary because of the collateral damage caused by the explosions and their aftermath While most trading takes place in Chicago and electronically from all points many registrants were located at ground zero in lower Manhattan This recognizes that firms may have had difficulty last week in moving funds issuing notices providing customers with access to records or precisely measuring portfolio values the CFTC said in a statement Sept The commission also extended relief to firms that have taken residence in temporary or incomplete facilities Those operations will be allowed through Oct to extend deadlines for calculations on segregated funds that normally would be due at noon on a given day to the close of the business day Similarly firms that are unable to access timestamping equipment will be allowed to use reasonable alternative methods to document times through Sept The CFTC also is asking firms that normally would file papers with the commissions New York regional officewhich had been located in the now leveled World Trade Centerto send the items to the Chicago regional office at South Riverside Plaza Suite North Chicago Ill The National Futures Association the leading organization representing the futures and options industry said it worked with the commission to come up with the relief package Larry Dyekman a spokesman for NFA said if the measures turn out not to be adequate the group would consider pushing for more remedies Acting CFTC Chairman James Newsome in a Sept statement praised the registrants preparedness for the almost unthinkable The foresight of their contingency plans the steady hand of their leadership and most of all the courage and tenacity of all of their people should instill in each of us great confidence in our nations financial system he said ISDA moves to stabilise derivatives markets Risk September By John Ferry The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has issued guidelines to help traders close outstanding equity derivatives positions following the major disruptions to financial markets caused by last weeks terrorist attack on the World Trade Center The trade body also said the posting of oneyear dollar swaps rates has resumed ISDA believes it is important to continue supporting orderly markets said Jonathan Moulds chair of ISDAs trading practice committee and head of global rates at Bank of America ISDA advised that unless parties otherwise agree Tuesday to Friday of last week should not be considered days on which valuation or expiry of equity options should have occurred The statement is relevant only where trading on a relevant exchange in the United States ceased or did not open as a result of the events occurring in New York City The latest statements follow advice given on Friday for the closing of energybased derivatives contracts ISDA advised that closing prices for the first day of trading following the market disruption should be used Clearinghouses Diversify or Die Appliederivativescom September Diversification Thats the name of the game in the futures clearing community today Derivatives clearinghouses sparked by the demutualization of the traditional exchanges they serve are now under more pressure than ever to search for new sources of revenue Moreover to retain their existing clients they are expected to continuously expand and improve their technology and services Indeed regardless of whether you are talking about the Board of Trade Clearing Corp Botcc the London Clearing House LCH or the Chicago Mercantile Exchanges CMEs Clearing House division the ability to wear multiple hats while filling the specific needs of different types of customers is integral to success Just like the exchanges clearing organizations are trying to reinvent themselves into traditional forprofit companies almost as a way to try and ensure their survival says a source close to the Botccs board Of course there is no standard recipe for reinvention All of the worlds largest derivatives clearinghouses are leveraging their assets in the name of evolution but their business models and strategies for growth vary significantly For example the CME and Stockholm Swedenbased OM have attempted to separate their internal clearinghouses from the pack by licensing their inhouse developed clearing systems to derivatives markets across the globe In contrast in lieu of licensing its software the independently owned LCH has expanded its reach and power by providing central counterparty transaction processing services to many different markets in its home country Meanwhile the Botcc is attempting to secure its future by offering its technology and services to upandcoming BB derivatives markets In fact to that end the Botcc recently developed MetaClear a comprehensive Internetbased suite of applications that covers everything from traditional clearing to transaction processing and payment for overthecounter derivatives Unlike its clearinghouse counterparts however the Botcc has one potentially large stumbling block in its path the looming demutualization of its largest client the Chicago Board of Trade CBOT Though the Botcc like the LCH is independently owned it still receives most of its revenues from the CBOT which clears all of its US transactions through the yearold clearing firm But the CBOT following in the footsteps of other large derivatives markets like the CME will probably eventually go forprofitmorphing from a memberowned exchange into a shareholderdriven market And when it does the management of the CBOT facing pressure to increase profit from shareholders may be forced to reevaluate the exchanges longstanding clearing relationship with the Botcc There is no doubt that demutualization at the CBOT could potentially lead to other views being taken of the services provided by the Botcc So the Botcc needs to diversify because it is at the moment a very undiversified entity says a LCH official Noting that the LCH provides central counterparty clearing services for the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange the London Metal Exchange the International Petroleum Exchange the London Stock Exchange eSpeed and EuroMTSamong other clientsthe official says that the LCH has an edge because it is truly independent Whats more he says that while other clearinghouses focus on licensing their derivativesclearing software the LCH differentiates itself by providing fullservice clearing services for a variety of instruments Others lead the way by trailblazing new technology we lead it by trailblazing new types of service the official says There is no other clearinghouse in the world that does futures and options cash equities interestrate swaps and fixed incomein the form of repo and cash bonds That said while expanding into new markets is part of the LCHs modus operandi the firm currently has no aspirations to chase after BB derivatives exchanges The BB marketplace today says the LCH official is too illiquid to derive any benefits from central counterparty clearing All that a central counterparty is doing with so few buyers and sellers within that space is simply adding cost So we just do not see an upside there he says Betting on BB While the LCH is skeptical about BB the Botcc believes that the marketplace is ripe with untapped clearing opportunities Thus far the firm which began its earnest pursuit of BB in early has snagged two new clients Opta Berkeley Califbased BB trading systems vendor which the original MetaClear application suite was designed forand Traianaa developer of frontend applications targeted at online BB derivatives markets In the last couple of years the Botcc has also signed agreements to provide US transactionprocessing services to BrokerTecan allelectronic interdealerbroker of fixedincome securitiesand the St Louis Merchants Exchangea startup market that trades large freight futures contracts Whats more says Botcc President and CEO Dennis Dutterer the clearing corporation will likely ink deals with two or three more participants in the BB space by year end Keeping all this in mind Dutterer says the Botcc is confident that it can use its BB strategy to diversify while simultaneously maintaining its deal with the CBOT Sixtyfive percent of the Botccs revenues he says come directly from transactions funneled to the firm through the CBOT and an additional percent is derived through capital and shareholder fund management The remaining percent comes from other revenue sources including BB clients Still though it clearly thinks BB is an important market segment Dutterer refuses to make any predictions about what percentage of Botccs revenues will stem from BB clients in the future We have not targeted a yearend revenue change because that type of thing does not occur overnight he says The source close to the Botccs board of governors says that BB truly presents a dilemma for the clearing corp On the one hand he says the exchangetraded futures business is currently saturatedmeaning very few clearing contracts remain up for grabs However though there may be as many as new BB markets they have probably collectively traded only a few hundred contracts the source says Their only chance to diversify in a big way is to score a home run with one of these BB deals he says But at the end of the day how much transactional BB business is out there Virtually none Integrated Approach OM like the LCH does not think todays BB markets offer a lot of opportunities for clearing firms Richard Dour the sales and marketing head of the financial systems unit of OMs technology division says that OM is not actively trying to license its standard clearing systemSecurto BB markets Rather OM has marketed Secur to traditional derivatives and energy exchanges at times trying to take advantage of the breadth of technology platforms it offers In addition to licensing its respective clearing systems on a standalone basis OM and the CME can offer prospective clients something that the Botcc and LCH do notan integrated trading engineclearing system package Together with its Clearing platform the CME offers exchange clients the ability to deploy Globexits trading engineon an integrated basis Similarly OM can provide a combination of Secur and Clickits derivatives trading enginefor clients that desire an integrated solution Citing the fact the CME has publicly declared its intent to investigate a potential IPO Merc officials declined to be interviewed for this story But Dour says OMs integrated SecurClick offering has netted the company a few exchange clients Indeed he says that in addition to OMs own exchanges the Korea Futures Exchange the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd the Vienna Stock Exchange the Athens Stock Exchange and Nordpool have selected the integrated ClickSecur package The source close to the Botccs board says that the integrated offerings definitely provide the CME and OM with an edge in the battle for clearing contracts If youre a BB or a new exchange you need a trading vehicle and you need a clearing vehicle Theyve got both of those systems and the Botcc really only has one says the source However citing the development of MetaClear and the clearing corps new clientsas well as its years of experiencethe Botccs Dutterer says his firm matches up well with every other clearinghouse While conceding that the likes of the CME OM and LCH may have a larger client base of exchange customers to refer potential clients to Dutterer adds that customer references will not make or break any clearing deal Large sophisticated organizations wont look solely at existing clients They wont buy a Chevrolet just because their brother bought a Chevrolet Rather they will sit down and evaluate what features are offered he says The source close to the Botcc agrees that exchanges are looking deeper than just client references when they search for clearing solutions However he says that in the US at least the public perception is that the CME Clearing House is better positioned than the Botcc I think the Botcc product line may be better than the CMEs clearing offerings but the Merc does a better job with marketing the source says The CME Clearing House he elaborates also has an edge because it is owned by an exchange that has already gone forprofitand is therefore more aggressively seeking new business opportunities That said regardless of which Chicago clearinghouse holds an advantage today rampant speculation about consolidation continues to cloud the future of the Botcc and CME Clearing House A couple of years back of course those organizations signed a letter of intent to mergebut never finalized the deal However pointing to merger talks that took place earlier this year between the Botcc and the Options Clearing Corp the source close to the Botcc says that consolidation in the name of survival is inevitable I dont really see a lot of opportunities for growth in the US clearing market Instead I see consolidation All of these clearing organizations in the US are not going to make it the source prognosticates End

of risk might decline in some places only to reemerge in others In particular it cited unfunded risk transfer as being difficult to monitor If flows of risk are not accompanied by flows of funds insurance or derivatives they become harder to track in aggregate the report said The review discussed possible areas where seemingly transferred credit risk by banks could revert to the sector It said that some techniques used in deals such as synthetic securitisations can leave banks with residual risks whether contractual or implicit The credit default swap market has not really been tested under a severe downside scenario and if the worst happens and the whole house falls down people may well find that none of their risk has actually been transferred said one analyst who was sympathetic to the BoEs line Credit derivatives dealers are more sanguine however Often you have no option but to use credit derivatives to back up transactions They can be used to get round regulatory and sourcing difficulties and some times they are just quicker and cheaper than the alternatives said one dealer The BoE also said that even in the instances where banks have genuinely transferred credit risk there is a question as to whether the appetite of the risk takers will be sustained General insurers reinsurers and life insurers might reduce their asset allocation to credit risk if losses were to increase materially during the current economic slowdown said the report The banks active in the credit derivatives market are confident that their risk transfer techniques work but admit that losses for insurance company sellers of protection could threaten the continuing growth of the market The BoE also questioned the extent to which the banking system can change from being the originator and holder to originator and distributor of credit risk saying that this may be limited by the close link between credit and provision of liquidity Credit risk is being transferred from banks to insurance companies But if credit losses crystallise in stressed market conditions insurance companies may need to have recourse to the banking system in order to meet their obligations under credit risk transfer instruments the report said Elsewhere in its review the BoE examined counterparty risk management and found that disclosure practice is still not sufficient to facilitate effective management It said that banks have growing exposure to nonbank participants in overthecounter derivatives and other capital markets such as insurance companies energy companies and large multinationals The recommendations of the official and private sector reports on counterparty risk management following the LTCM crisis were addressed particularly to banks hedge fund exposure However the Enron case shows that many apply more widely particularly the need for counterparties to make adequate financial disclosure Vulture firms begin to set their sights on troubled Argentina Financial Times December Edward Bozaan says he made money in Russia and Thailand soon after they devalued their currencies in the late s Now the New Yorkbased fund manager is considering buying assets in Argentina Bloomberg reports I buy into extraordinarily depressed markets and Argentina is definitely on my screen right now says the year old president of Waterford Partners a fund management company whose promotional material contains pictures of tanks and explosions Its markets are really scraping bottom As the country nears default on most of its Dollars bn debt and struggles to avert devaluation Mr Bozaan says he and others who specialise in investing in countries in crisis are assessing whether prices have reached bottom after the Merval stock index fell to year lows and bonds plummeted Mr Bozaans fund grew per cent in helped by his purchase of Russian companies such as Vimpelcom Communications after the country defaulted on Dollars bn of debt and devalued the rouble In the first nine months of this year the fund lost per cent compared with per cent drop in the MSCI Emerging Market Index Domingo Cavallo Argentine economy minister blamed foreign funds such as Mr Bozaans for the countrys troubles saying they drove down stock and bond values and pushed up interest rates That forced the government last week to limit deposit withdrawals to prevent a collapse of the banking system Mr Cavallo said They are the same funds that got rich in Russia in and who attacked Ecuador and hurt the Ecuadorean people Mr Cavallo said in a speech The same funds have been focused on Argentina in While many describe companies such as Waterford as vulture funds Mr Bozaan says he is not responsible for driving down Argentine markets Some see my business as morbid but it wasnt me who brought down the prices says Mr Bozaan I see value in markets after theyve been battered In fact any fund that buys Argentine securities would help the economy says Charles Cassel who helps manage Dollars m in emerging market assets at Standard Asset Management Vulture funds are a beneficiary to the economy in that they provide an inflow of capital at a time when it desperately needs it he says Mr Bozaan uses studies of past financial crises elsewhere as a guide to when prices may recover I strongly believe Argentina will become one of the best performing markets in the world some day and thats when well make our money says Mr Bozaan who typically acquires shares that have dropped per cent to per cent in a market where the benchmark index has lost per cent By Mr Bozaans rule he should already be investing in Argentina Since January the Merval has dropped by half and leading stocks such as Grupo Financiera Galicia a bank holding company have fallen more than two thirds The benchmark floating rate bond due in gained a second day to yield about per cent The Merval now trading at levels last seen in March rose per cent There are many corporate stocks and bonds that would be extremely interesting once uncertainty over the governments restructuring and future is cleared up says Richard Segal director of research at Exotix ICAPs Londonbased debt brokerage Mr Bozaan says he has not yet invested because he believes the government may devalue the peso which was fixed at par with the US dollar in and is a key reason economists say why Argentine industry is unable to compete with cheaper imports Theres definitely more downside to come says Mr Bozaan I want to see some resolution in what the government will do If Argentina devalues after Ive bought the fund could lose a lot of money Mr Bozaan says his interest in Argentina has grown as the country suffers an increase in public protests against rising unemployment and cuts in government spending on salaries pensions and health I bought after Chinas Tianenmen Square massacre Perus Shining Path crisis and Thailands riots he says Argentinas not quite on that scale but its situation isnt good Among shares Mr Bozaan may buy are Grupo Financiera Galicia Telecom Argentina StetFrance Telecom and Perez Companc an oil company Group Galicia trades at about times past earnings compared with Banco Bradesco a Brazilian bank that trades at times earnings and Citigroup of the US which trades at times Telecom Argentina trades at times earnings against times for Brasil Telecom Perez Companc trades at times earnings compared with BPs per cent Mr Segal recommends buying bank and utility bonds Grupo Galicia and Banco Rio look like good buys so do some of the telecom and electricity companies he says Telefonica bids to shield atrisk Brazil interests Financial Times December By Leslie Crawford and Krishna Guha Telefonica of Spain the largest foreign investor in Latin America has used derivatives to hedge against a possible devaluation in Argentina and any risk of that countrys financial crisis spilling over into neighbouring Brazil Cesar Alierta Telefonica chairman told the Financial Times The crisis in Argentina is not a Latin American crisis We are confident that Brazil has decoupled from Argentinas problems Telefonica has more than Euros bn Dollars bn invested in Latin America The region provides per cent of its revenues which totalled Euros bn in the first nine months of the year and almost per cent of the companys cash flow Telefonica would not disclose the size of its hedging operations but said its derivatives portfolio is significant Executives said We are not immune to the effects of a devaluation but we will be less affected than the market thinks There should be no need to write down the value of its assets in the event of a devaluation of the Argentine peso which has been pegged to the dollar for a decade Telefonica said it has budgeted for a rise in unpaid telephone bills as the crisis in Argentina bites Operating revenues at TASA Telefonicas Argentine subsidiary were down per cent in the first nine months of the year Mr Alierta however is bullish about prospects in Brazil where Telefonica has invested Dollars bn Telefonica owns Telesp which has m clients and is the largest fixedline operator in the prosperous industrial state of Sao Paulo Early next year it hopes to pool its mobile interests in several Brazilian states with Portugal Telecoms big mobile operation in Sao Paulo With lines per employee Telesp is probably the most efficient operator in the world Mr Alierta said He is particularly enthusiastic about the potential for broadband communications in Brazil Armey Would Split Derivatives Issue From Stalled Bankruptcy Reform Bill BNA December Despite opposition from House Judiciary Committee leadership House Majority Leader Richard Armey RTexas told BNA Dec he wants the House to take up contract netting legislation apart from the stalled bankruptcy reform bill HR to which it is attached I think it is time to move netting Armey said using another name for the derivatives bill They members of the Judiciary Committee see netting as a very important kind of a driving engine within their bill And I appreciate their point of view but I think this is something that needs to get completed and I have talked to the committee about it repeatedly House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner RWis is against consideration of financial derivatives legislation apart from bankruptcy reform legislation which has been stuck in conference for months a Sensenbrenner aide told BNA Dec Contract netting language intended to reduce uncertainty and limit systemic risk in derivatives transactions was added to the bankruptcy bill at a time when Republican leadership was optimistic the legislation could pass this year and that its inclusion could help speed the process House staff told BNA Hindsight is a House Republican aide told BNA Who knew the bankruptcy bill would be grounded again Sensenbrenner and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael Oxley ROhio met with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan Dec to discuss the importance of legislation addressing banks use of financial derivatives DER A Oxley strongly supports passing derivatives legislation this year according to his spokeswoman especially in light of the recent collapse of Enron Corp which traded heavily in derivatives Even if a derivatives bill fails to pass Congress again this year its separate consideration would indicate just what poor odds Republican leadership places on bankruptcy reform passing in the foreseeable future Presumably if the House took up a derivatives bill it would vote on an independent contract netting bill HR that Rep Pat Toomey RPa introduced on Nov Its language is identical to language contained in numerous contract netting bills offered as far back as when thenHouse Banking Committee Chairman James Leach RIowa championed the issue Currently no companion bill exists in the Senate Although Democrats particularly members of the HouseSenate conference on HR who oppose bankruptcy reform are likely to support passage of a contract netting bill it is unclear whether key Republicans would A spokeswoman for Sen Chuck Grassley RIowa a member of the bankruptcy reform conference told BNA that the senator is likely to oppose separating contract netting from HR Derivatives are financial contracts used by parties wishing to hedge the risk of fluctuations in interest rates foreign exchange rates or indexes Their value is based on the performance of an underlying asset Seven large commercial banks account for about percent of all derivatives the most common of which is an interest rate contract

DERIVATIVES ISDA addresses successorconvertible issues IFR New York dealers go it alone on default swap clause IFR ENERGY What Enron Did Right The Wall Street Journal OPERATIONS FpML group joins ISDA IFR Japanese Accounting Changes November Derivatives Week Learning Curves There have been major changes to accounting standards in Japan which by the time they have all been implemented will have brought Japanese accounting standards broadly into line with international norms These changes are comprehensive and include the introduction of fair value or marktomarketaccounting This last change although seemingly innocuous will be particularly powerful in its impact But What Has All This To Do With Derivatives The introduction of marktomarket accounting requires listed Japanese companies to record their holding of marketable property assets and securities at current market value rather than at book value This means that balance sheets will no longer be buttressed by assets valued at inflated bubble economy levels But most crucially profit streams will become exposed to movements in equity markets as the definition of securities includes the cross shareholdings which bind members of Japans Keiretsu and other business groupings These are substantial in Japan accounting for perhaps of all shareholdings The unwinding of cross shareholdings is undoubtedly one of the factors behind the recent weakness of Tokyo stock prices not least as foreign buyers who had been soaking up much of the unwound cross held shares coming onto to the market have been notably absent over the past few months Hence there has been much talk about how best to unwind these cross shareholdings without further depressing the market Where possible firms with mutual shareholdings have been seeking arrangements that are effectively straight swaps But derivatives can also play their part Many corporates with large shareholding disposal programmes have been actively seeking to hedge their equity exposure as they embark on their share sale process Often they have effected this through the use of call options Thus if the market falls they have at least benefited from the premium earned at the time of the sale of the call option and if the market rises and the option is called by the purchaser then the shares have been successfully disposed of but without further dampening an already weak market Financial institutions have also been combining a similar strategy with stock lending thereby gaining both the option premium and a lending fee Certainly many market observers have been reporting an increase in such call option trades over the past year or so Moreover even for firms that do not wish to sell down their equity portfolios the increased profit volatility which will result from having to revalue portfolios and book these changes though the profit and loss account will significantly increase the attractions of hedging Allied to this and flowing from the realisation of the full extent of the weakness of many Japanese financial institutions there has also been an increase in the use of credit derivatives which has allowed investors to sell the risk of entering into a transaction with a Japanese bank This market has been cyclical rising and falling with the changes in perceptions of the true financial state of the countrys banking sector However the underlying demand is there The Flip Side In the same way that Japanese banks and corporates must book the true value of their equity portfolios they must also report the true market value of their derivatives positions And there is concern that this will only serve further to expose the weakness of the banks in particular So it has been reported that the Japanese Bankers Association zenginkyo has been lobbying the accounting standards making body the Japan Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a further delay in the introduction of the mark to market requirement for derivatives This is in addition to the oneyear delay already secured The original delay was portrayed as in response to difficulties arising out of the consolidation of the Japanese banks around three or four major groupings but most market observers suspect that this was only a smokescreen to cover up for the ineffective hedging strategies of the major banks most notably macro hedging Now the bankers representative body is suggesting the deadline be extended further perhaps indefinitely This may get the banks at least part way out of the shortterm crunch they are under from greater disclosure requirements but with the Japanese economy continuing to deteriorate with serious consequences for the size of the nonperforming loans problem the Japanese financial system will have to face the music sometime ISDA addresses successorconvertible issues IFR November Standard documentation aimed at clarifying which company should serve as reference entity for credit default swaps in the event of a demerger or other structural change such as a consolidation will be put forward by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association this week While the successor issue has been debated since the breakup of National Power of the UK the imminent breakups of ATT and BT into smaller entities has underscored the need for improved documentation Ambiguity arose out of the ISDA credit derivative definitions because they defined the successor as the entity that assumes all or substantially all of the original companys relevant obligations ATTs demerger plans for example create no clear successor under ISDAs definitions To eliminate the uncertainty for those that bought or sold protection on companies that do not produce a clear successor ISDAs supplement on successor issues uses a tiered set of numerical standards said Kimberley Summe general counsel of ISDA Chip Goodrich managing director in the legal department at Deutsche Bank and chairman of ISDAs documentation committee said that he did not expect extensive comments on the new documentation as possible resolutions to the issue had been thoroughly debated by market participants Under the standard a new entity that receives of the original companys bonds and loans after a demerger would be deemed the reference obligation for a credit default swap If the test is not applicable then a test applies If more than of the underlyings obligations are held by a new reference entity then the credit derivative transaction must be broken up into several separate transactions of equal weight said Goodrich who also sits on ISDAs credit derivatives market practice group In the event that no successor company assumes o of the original companys obligations another set of rules come into play The entity that receives the highest percentage of the original companys loans and bonds becomes the sole successor Should the debt be evenly split between two entities in this category the one that assumes the highest percentage of obligations loans debt and other borrowed money is deemed the successor No successor will be appointed if the original reference entity continues to exist In a separate development ISDA published a supplement to the ISDA credit definitions that specifies not contingent as one of the delivery obligation characteristics This clarifies that convertible exchangeable or accreting bonds qualify to be delivered said Goodrich Its a clarification of what was implicit in the definition in the past he added This has become an issue because of the surge of activity in hedging of convertible bonds this year and the debate last month over whether Railtracks convertible bond was deliverable under existing swap contracts Most of the major dealers made an immediate move to use of the new ISDA language by adopting it as standard in default swap contracts last week New York dealers go it alone on default swap clause IFR November By John Macaskill Abandonment of the obligation acceleration clause is unlikely to cause a rift within the credit derivatives trading community as serious as the one that developed over the restructuring clause earlier this year All the same last weeks unilateral move by the main New York dealers took European traders and default swap end users by surprise It came almost exactly a year after a similar decision by the most active New York dealers to drop restructuring as a standard credit event for US corporate default swaps That move threatened a schism within the credit derivatives market and a reduction in overall liquidity because of different trade practices being followed in different regimes Damage to liquidity The threat was headed off by traders and users of credit derivatives from both Europe and the US who worked on committees coordinated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA to agree a modified definition of the restructuring clause as a credit event The new definition was agreed at the end of April and released in May but liquidity in the default swap market was hit in the early months of the year by the uncertainty caused by the debate The issue of obligation acceleration had not been a great concern for dealers until Moodys indicated that it was uncomfortable with the inclusion of what it viewed as a soft credit event in the default swaps that back creditlinked notes and collateralised debt obligations Obligation acceleration and obligation default are two clauses that can trigger default swap exercises under the standard ISDA credit derivatives definitions Dealers have been aware that the payment of an obligation might be accelerated owing to the breach of a covenant on a bond or loan This might trigger exercise on a default swap when there was still a chance that the covenant could be made whole before the fundamental default event failure to make a debt payment had taken place Most dealers decided that this was not a major issue however mainly because there do not appear to have been any examples of obligation acceleration triggering a default swap and because covenant breaching will almost certainly come at the same time as failure to pay on a liability However Moodys turned the debate into an economic issue for dealers by objecting to incorporation of the clause in the swaps used to back synthetic collateralised debt obligations Dealers have been making enormous profits from synthetic securitisation this year Three of the top credit derivatives trading houses have each sold over USbn of swapbacked issuance this year and a string of dealers have sold between USbn and USbn This is high margin business with fees of over bp for a deal often seen Profit drag Moodys applies a increase to the default probability used for the COOs it rates if they are backed by swaps featuring the obligation acceleration clause Banks can cut this charge by incorporating language that specifies a timeframe for covenant breaches to be cured None the less the clause can still be a significant drag on their CDO income It is also an economic issue for Moodys because swaps without the obligation acceleration clause match more closely the criteria of its historical default database one of its major assets It was never clear to us how obligation acceleration as a credit event had any meaning in these transactions said Noel Kirnon managing director responsible for collateralised debt obligations and derivatives at Moodys He welcomed last weeks move to drop the clause as a standard feature of default swaps traded in the US Derivatives dealing heads in New York echo this sentiment and point out that buyers of credit protection will still be able to request that obligation acceleration is included as a feature in a swap In the first few days of trading without standard inclusion of the clause last week there was no evidence of a price basis opening up between contracts with the clause and those without indicating that it is not yet being viewed as an economic factor by buyers of protection It is basically a redundant credit event said the US head of credit derivatives at one bank For protection buyers it does not particularly weaken the power of the contract he added European objections There were some objectors to the move among dealers active in the US market as UBS and Commerzbank declined to drop the clause for standard contracts The other big dealers moved in step however These include Citigroup CSFB Deutsche Bank Goldman JP Morgan Chase Lehman and Merrill Some dealers would also like to change use of the repudiationmoratorium clause in default swaps to make it clear that it cannot be used to apply to a corporate credit but no change in market practice is expected The essential credit derivative settlement debates in recent months over successor entity and convertible deliverability have been resolved on a global basis There is no indication that European traders and end users of default swaps will fall into line with the contract shift made in the US last week however The New York dealers decision was surprising but it wasnt the first time they have moved unilaterally said one European trader Europe will stick with obligation acceleration and the repudiationmoratorium he predicted What Enron Did Right The Wall Street Journal November By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner This is a rough era for American business icons Subject to the vagaries of age Jack Welch product failure FordFirestone tires competition Lucent ATT technology HewlettPackard and Compaq and dotbomb bubbles CMGI managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business The latest example is Enron whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy Once considered one of the countrys most innovative companies Enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest The journalistic accounts of Enrons struggles drip with schadenfreude hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value Deregulation and market competition Enron envisioned gas and electric power industries in the US where prices are set in an open market of bidding by customers and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit Enron was the leader in pioneering this business Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the US and is spreading to Europe Latin America and Asia The winners have been consumers who have paid lower prices and investors who have seen competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient The contrary experience of California the poster child of those who would reregulate the power industry is an example of not enough deregulation Innovation and the deintegration of power contracts Under the old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity customers were offered a onesizefitsall contract For many customers this system was inflexible and inefficient like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure by the truckload Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer To do this Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent parts starting with price and volume location time etc and offered customers choices on each one Again consumers won Enrons investors did too because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors Arguably Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the process of Creative Destruction But creative destroyers are not necessarily likable pleasant folks which may be part of Enrons problem today Minimization of transaction costs and frictions Enron extended the logic of deintegration to other industries An integrated paper company for instance owns forests mills pulp factories and paper plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate activities better than smaller specialized firms Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of customers and suppliers Enron envisioned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the bet that the freemarket terms would be better than those of the internal operations The development of freemarket benchmarks for the terms by which divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the economy Exploiting the optionality in networks In the old regulated environment natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pipeline Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a number of possible sources opening the customer to the benefits of competition and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network so that they could nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons This policy picked up by others in the industry created tremendous value for both customers and suppliers Rigorous risk assessment The strategy of tailored contracts could easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the trading risks that the firm assumed and of very strong internal controls Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among the best anywhere Particularly with the advent of Enron Online where Enron made new positions valued at over billion each day it became essential to have uptothesecond information on companywide positions prices and ability to deliver The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by the firm but with fears among trading partners about Enrons ability to finance its trading activity In a world where contracts and trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance It was the erosion in equity rather than trading risk that destroyed the firm A culture of urgency innovation and high expectations Enrons corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all The Hollywood stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic hierarchical formal slow and full of excuses And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company Enron only years ago is even duller and slower Enron became bumptious impatient lean fast innovative and demanding It bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses create markets and transfer within the firm Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion and an openoffice design fostered brainstorming The firms organization and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs This was a lightning rod for the firms detractors And yet it could serve as a model for more hidebound enterprises to emulate Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformation of American business It created a ruckus in oncequiet corners of the business economy It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in which it did business It thrived on volatility The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major RD establishment especially given Dynegys track record as a second mover following Enrons lead Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and timeconsuming antitrust review Dynegys greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enrons spirit of innovation its own Or so we all should hope because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake their industries FpML group joins ISDA IFR November The International Swaps and Derivatives Association last week announced plans to incorporate FpMLorg a nonprofit industry body dedicated to developing a business information exchange standard for electronic dealing and processing of financial derivative transactions FpMLorgs funding is stable But the founding members recognise that the standard is broadly beneficial to the industry and that working with ISDA is the best way to continue developing it said Brian Lynn vicepresident of etrading at JP Morgan Chase in New York This is an exciting and important step toward derivatives technology development that is consistent with other ISDA efforts to provide an effective structure for derivatives documentation and trading said Robert Pickel executive director and chief executive of ISDA We have common membership and have been talking to each other for a while he added noting that FpMLorgs language uses ISDA documentation and terms as its foundation Financial product Markup Languages FpML chief virtue is that it addresses straightthrough processing It offers a basis for achieving straightthrough processing of trades back office systems and settlement systems Greater automation reduces the time it takes to close a deal and the rate of error In the industry spent roughly USbn processing OTC derivatives transactions and at some firms about of that figure represented documentation errors said JP Morgans Lynn The manual confirmation matching processes required today is not included in the figure he added In theory liquidity should also receive a boost from a move to greater automation For smaller end users it means that there is less work involved in entering into a transaction said Lynn No decision on linking FpMLs transaction standards with ISDA master and netting agreements has been made yet but such a move is likely in the future ISDA initiatives aimed at providing members with extensible markup language XML resources for netting and negotiating storing and archiving ISDA master agreements seem to point in this direction as FpML is an XML solution ISDAs interactive web and CDROM based documentation library is in an XML format currently The integration of FpML into ISDA will mean speeding up the development of the standard and expansion of its coverage consistent with our original mission The goals of FpMLorg and ISDA are similar as both have worked towards technological advancement in standard setting said Philippe KhuongHuu a managing director at Goldman Sachs and chairman of FpMLorgs board of directors Joining forces with ISDA will also help raise the profile of FpML but awareness of its potential is not a problem said Lynn The issue is deploying systems that use the standard Two multidealer trading systems for interest rate derivatives that are being tested now Reuters Dealing for Swaps and SwapsWire plan to go live using FpML FpML use at individual banks is done on a proprietary basis for now No banks yet operate on XML on a companywide basis FpMLorgs architectural working group and its working groups covering interest rate foreign exchange and equity derivatives will continue to exist as subgroups of ISDAs new FpML committee ISDAs FpML committee will retain responsibility for approving new versions of the standard Vendors will continue to be represented on the standards committee and on working groups said Lynn FpML standards currently exist for interest rate derivative products and forward rate agreements Foreign exchange and equity derivatives standards arc nearing completion End of ISDA Press Report for

REGULATORY CFTC makes amendments to CFMA Risk News TRADING PRACTICE Banks tout economic derivatives IFR Pricing Synthetic CDOs Derivatives Week October Traditionally collateralized debt obligations CDOs involve a transfer of collateral assets The CDO liabilities then reference the cash flows principal and interest of the collateral assets But CDOs are increasingly issued in synthetic form where there is no physical transfer of collateral In these structures the CDO references default losses rather than the cash flows of the referenced collateral Credit Default Swaps In their simplest form synthetic CDOs are akin to single name credit default swaps A credit default swap is a contract where one party the protection buyer makes periodic payments in exchange for payments contingent on a credit event In a single name credit default swap the credit event is the default of a single issuer Thus the price of the credit default swaps reflects the markets view of the default likelihood of the reference name In unfunded form a synthetic CDO is essentially a basket default swap In this case in return for a premium the protection seller makes contingent payments based on the default losses incurred by a portfolio or basket of assets The protection may be for first loss or equity in which case the seller pays for the initial default losses up to some threshold second loss or mezzanine where the seller pays losses beyond the first loss threshold up to some higher limit or senior where the seller pays all losses beyond a threshold Synthetic CDOs may also be structured in funded form The simplest form of this structure is a combination of a risk free bond and a basket default swap The initial investment is used to purchase the risk free bond and at the outset the investor receives the risk free rate of interest from the bond as well as premium payments from the basket default swap As losses occur on the reference portfolio the principal of the bond is reduced to pay the required contingent payments At the maturity of the structure the investor receives the remaining principal of the risk free position In both funded and unfunded forms the pricing of synthetic CDOs is primarily a matter of pricing the basket default swaps themselves Correlation Products It is often said that synthetic CDOs are correlation products because their value depends not only on the probability of default for each individual name in the reference portfolio but also on the correlation between those names Consider a simple case where the reference portfolio consists of two names each with a probability of default Assume two levels of protection one paying on the first default and one paying on the second If the names are independent then the probability that the first loss protection is triggered is that is less the chance that there are zero defaults The probability that the second loss protection is triggered is that is only if there are two defaults On the other hand if the defaults are perfectly correlated then there are only two possibilities either both or neither of the names default Thus the probability that either protection is triggered is the probability that both names default or Note that for the first loss protection the increased correlation has reduced the likelihood that the protection is invoked and therefore reduced the fair price of this protection For the second loss piece the increased correlation has increased the trigger likelihood and fair price The relationship between correlation and pricing holds generally for the first loss and most senior levels of protection in basket default swaps For the first loss piece since losses are capped the pricing is driven primarily by the likelihood that no losses occur which increases with correlation For the senior piece the pricing is driven by the likelihood that an extreme loss occurs which is greater in cases of higher correlation Pricing Based on the discussion above most pricing models require individual default probabilities and a correlation across the names in the pool Since individual default probabilities can often be obtained from single name creditdefault swaps correlation is the main pricing parameter for synthetic CDOs Consider an example structure with USD million of collateral where first loss protects against the first USD million of losses second loss protects against the next USD million of losses and the remaining losses are protected by the senior tranche We can model spreads on each of these tranches at different correlation levels For example using a correlation of we obtain model spreads of two basis points bps and bps for the senior second loss and first loss protection respectively We can repeat this exercise at different correlation levels to obtain the sensitivity of spreads to changes in correlation Figure shows the normalized cost of protection for each tranche at different correlation levels We can see that the cost of protection for the senior tranche increases with increasing correlation that is the cost increases as senior debt gets riskier while the first loss protection cost decreases with increasing correlation that is the cost decreases as equity gets less risky Note that in this particular example the cost of second loss protection behaves like senior as an increasing function of correlation Implied Correlation We can back out an implied correlation for each tranche from CDO prices in the same way we would obtain implied volatility from option prices and the BlackScholes pricing model An implied correlation extracted in this fashion depends on the specific CDO pricing model but the observations above hold generally Suppose the market spreads for our example structure are bps bps and bps for the senior second loss and first loss protection respectively We can compare these observed spreads with our model spreads to calibrate a correlation parameter for each tranche For example the model spread is equal to the observed spread for the senior tranche bps when we price it using a correlation In other words the implied correlation for the senior tranche is The implied correlation for each tranche can be inferred from Figure as the correlation level with which our pricing model recovers the observed market spread We can see that for the first and second loss tranches the implied correlation is roughly while for the senior tranche the implied correlation is A first application of the implied correlation is to mark to market a synthetic tranche on an ongoing basis As we observe changes in the spreads for the individual names in the pool we can reprice the tranches above by assuming the correlation level is constant but updating the spreads Additionally implied correlations can be used for relative value analysis For example senior and second loss tranche protection increase in value as correlation increases Since both tranches depend on the same basket of names we would expect them to have a similar implied correlation As mentioned above the implied correlation of the senior tranche is significantly higher than that of the second loss tranche This means that senior protection is expensive relative to second loss protection We can also perform relative value analysis across deals if we believe that the pools in two different CDOs have similar characteristics in terms of credit quality industry and geographical distribution For example if two CDOs have similar pools and structure we would expect to observe comparable implied correlations for their senior tranches All else being equal a discrepancy in implied correlation can serve as an indicator of a discrepancy in price between the two structures CFTC makes amendments to CFMA Risk News October By Naomi Humphries The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC has released the final rules relating to the trading of equity futures products in the United States These rules implement provisions of the Commodity Futures Modernisation Act of CFMA that lift the year ban on the trading of singlestock and narrowbased stock index futures in the US The final rules are in line with the new CFMA statutory provisions regarding the specification of listing standards and conditions for trading security futures products The rules also establish requirements related to the selfcertification of rules and rule amendments reporting of data speculative position limits and special provisions regarding the contract design for the cash settlement and physical delivery of security futures products The CFTC received comment from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME the Chicago Board Options Exchange CBOE the American Stock Exchange Amex and the Intermarket Surveillance Group ISG The CFTC adopted several revisions consistent with comments but stated Generally the commentators supported the proposed rules The CFTC also streamlined the trading process in its revisions of rules governing commodity futures and options intermediaries on October following the enactment of the CFMA and the resulting revisions to the Commodity Exchange Act CEA Key rules governing intermediaries including futures commission merchants introducing brokers commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisers have been revised to provide greater flexibility consistent with the mandate of the CFMA to streamline and eliminate unnecessary regulation for entities registered under the act They include a provision for retail customers to have broad access to registered derivatives transaction execution facilities by permitting them to trade through a commodity trading adviser with million or more in assets under management and a proposal to replace the current prescriptive rule over ethics with a statement of acceptable practices The CFTC claimed that comments from Fimat a registered futures commission merchant and securities brokerdealer Exchange Analytics an ethics training provider the CBOT the National Futures Association and the Managed Funds Association all generally supported the adoption of the proposed amendments for commodity futures and options intermediaries It added that the issue that generated the most discussion was ethics training Acting chairman at the CFTC James Newsome said These rules are just the first step in the Commissions review of appropriate regulatory relief for intermediaries We have begun the intermediary study that Congress directed us to perform and we may well be implementing additional regulatory reforms prior to the studys conclusion Banks tout economic derivatives IFR October Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan will be using an auction mechanism to deliver the new derivatives products which they say

the debut products for its economic derivatives franchises in Europe and Japan JP Morgan Chase is still in the process of selecting its inaugural US economic statistics product JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank declined to disclose the cost of their franchise on the economic derivatives To retain their exclusive agreements with Longitude for the Parimutuel Digital Call Auction PDCAenabled derivatives the banks must meet performance benchmarks Longitude charges a fee based on the notional volume cleared through its system Using Longitudes PDCA bookrunner product Deutsche Bank for example would engage in premarketing or preselling activity that is similar to that in a bond or equity syndicate offering followed by a short auction period During the auction period the bank would submit orders to buy or sell digital options on the economic data covered to Longitudes webbased system Upon receipt of the orders Longitudes system produces bidoffer prices for the derivatives being offered and other relevant market equilibrium statistics such as limit order books Longitude routes this information back to the bank which publishes the statistics for its customers In this example Deutsche Bank would be counterparty to transactions that are filled An order that is filled would result in an International Swaps and Derivatives Associationdocumented transaction The filled orders should hedge themselves because in a parimutuel system all claims that end inthemoney are funded by those outofthemoney Longitudes clients can offer derivatives without assuming additional risks on their own balance sheets said Andrew Lawrence chief executive of Longitude As the systern accepts orders with limit prices capital markets participants can have a high level of price certainty In a parimutuel system prices are marketdriven and determined by customer participation rather than a model or subjective assessment of the price of risk Doubfers A parimutuel model is a demand and supply based market so the question becomes Will there be enough participants said Richard Sandor chief executive of Environmental Financial Products and one of the architects of the interest rate futures markets Is it view taking or traditional hedging Im not sure said one bulge bracket firms head of market risk management Numbers of participants are difficult to predict because they will depend upon the design of the specific auction said Longitudes Lawrence Perhaps as few as total orders can form a very rich auction equilibrium he said The cost of operating the call auction is another consideration A high transaction charge will mean less money for the winners It varies from market to market But because banks are not taking market risk the price for the service will be modest said Lawrence In general it has always been considered extremely desirable to disaggregate risk factors to the fullest extent possible because they can always be easily recombined Lets assume a health maintenance organisation HMO wishes to hedge out its exposure to annual medical cost inflation in the US and that the health industry accounts for slightly less than of US gross domestic product What can this HMO do now in the traditional markets to mitigate this risk Not much But JP Morgan could offer derivatives based directly upon this very important measure in order to offer a risk management product for this HMO he said Both JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are expecting early interest from financial institutions and fixedincome participants in particular because no mechanism for isolating and hedging or speculating on the growth rate of a countrys economy currently exists Deutsche Banks strategy for introducing the new products will initially hinge on drumming up internal interest said Kevin Rodgers global head of currency options at Deutsche Bank in London In January the banks trading desks will start using it internally to hedge their own positions This activity will be useful in providing the bank with probability distributions he added Deutsche Bank will then try to get other banks proprietary and swap desks to use the system The new products will probably be available for use by hedge funds commodity trading advisers and fund managers by the third quarter of next year JP Morgan Chase expects to start its franchise market on US economic statistic derivatives next month End of ISDA

Build Up Experience IFR November Endusers of credit derivatives in the US and Canada are trading an average of deals a year and make use of with six to seven traders on average according to a report released last week by consultant Greenwich Associates The larger the user the more dealers they are using said Peter DAmario principal at Greenwich and one of the authors The multiple points of contact though they complicate documentation for endusers indicate that endusers are learning and triangulating what they are hearing DAmario said As credit derivatives are still a relatively new market this strategy may assist users in benefiting from price differentials They are still concerned enough to go around and talk with people he added The largest and most sophisticated users of credit derivatives report an average of trades a year according to the report Banks were the biggest users of credit derivatives in terms of volume Reinsurers and insurers fund mangers and hedge funds in that order filled in the ranking of users said DAmario noting that corporates ranked last on the list of users About onethird of the corporates interviewed for the survey said they did not use credit derivatives However no other grouping is looking so aggressively at becoming involved in the market in the future Roughly half of the corporates not currently using credit derivatives stated an intention to use them within the next year The interdealer market was excluded from the survey Although endusers are using six or seven dealers they are giving of their business to three of their top dealers The other three or four are fighting for of the business said DAmario Thats unsustainable I wouldnt be surprised if there is a contraction in the average number of dealing relationships Firms that do not offer a broad product array may be knocked out first Greenwich said the dealers that fare best in its rankings are those that offer a depth and breadth of relationships product knowledge structuring ability and an understanding of client needs DAmario said About of endusers cited a relationship as a reason for picking a dealer though listed competitive quotes as their top reason for selecting a dealer When we asked people that right off the bat they say competitive quotes Then we derive from data what it is that correlates with being one of a users top three dealers It is never competitive quotes The real reason for selecting a dealer is relationships DAmario said Treasurys Bair Congress Should Pass Netting Laws This Year Dow Jones November By Rebecca Christie A senior Treasury official said Friday that Congress should find a way to pass socalled netting legislation even if more broadbased bankruptcy legislation stalls Sheila Bair assistant secretary for financial institutions told an American Bar Association committee that there was an immediate need for the proposal which would make it easier for banks and businesses to settle financial contracts if one of the parties becomes insolvent The relevant provisions are a noncontroversial portion of broader legislation to revise the bankruptcy laws We are concerned however that the controversial issues of the broader legislation may not be resolved soon enough to allow its passage this year Bair said The proposed changes would limit market disruptions in the event of insolvency and also reduce the risks to federally regulated participants and to the overall financial system Bair said Whether as part of comprehensive bankruptcy reform legislation or as a standalone bill we believe that Congress should enact netting legislation this year Further delays would unnecessarily place the financial system at greater risk Bair said Momentum Builds For US Derivatives Insolvency Bill Dow Jones November By Dawn Kopecki The nations leading securities trading groups urged congressional leaders Tuesday to pass legislation that allows financial institutions and corporations to close out their derivatives contracts during an insolvency The current economic climate worsened by the tragedy of Sept has made passage of these provisionscritical to the systemic risk reduction given the combination of market disruption and economic uncertainty reads a letter sent Tuesday to House and Senate leaders from The Bond Market Association The Financial Services Roundtable International Swaps and Derivatives Association the Futures Industry Association and a half dozen other financial organizations Pressure to pass the legislation has mounted since the Sept terrorist attacks shut down US financial markets and destroyed the Manhattan offices of many Wall Street brokerage houses Even though no company went under as a result of the market disruption the fear of institutional failures has grown and support is mounting for passing the provision apart from the controversial bankruptcy bill to which it is attached The measure allows institutions to quickly close outstanding derivatives with bankrupt trading partners by netting all the losses and gains of individual contracts into one deal Congress should not fail to enact netting legislation this year Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill wrote House lawmakers last month Further delays would unnecessarily place the financial system at greater risk But congressional support for tightening US bankruptcy laws has dwindled in the face of a probable recession As a result Rep Pat Toomey RPa introduced the netting measure as its own bill in the House last week Although we support passage of these provisions as part of the larger bankruptcyreform legislationwe share concerns of the key financial regulators that broader bankruptcy legislation may not be resolved soon enough to allow passage this year the trade groups wrote We urge you and your leadership team to pass netting legislation as quickly as possible so that we do not miss an opportunity for enactment this year German regulator may follow US Financial Times November By Bertrand Benoit The integration of European capital markets means Germanys securities regulator will need to model itself increasingly on the US Securities and Exchange Commission according to Georg Wittich the German authoritys chairman One should examine whether the SEC might not be the appropriate structure for securities regulation in the future Mr Wittich said in an interview We will have to go towards more centralisation at the German level as the need arises for increased cooperation between regulators at the European level Created in the Frankfurtbased Federal Supervisory Office for Securities Trading or BAWe is one of the few financial markets regulators in Europe not to act as supervisor for the stock exchange For historical reasons this responsibility lies with the government of the state of Hesse Although BAWe is responsible for overseeing companies official announcements to financial market participants it has no power to investigate suspected cases of market manipulation and no authority to approve share offer prospectuses if they are linked to a public listing While it is mandated to investigate insider trading the authority has no right to sue or sanction offenders Instead it must transfer all suspected cases to a public prosecutor for criminal investigation In practice few insidertrading cases ever reach court A planned bill recently adopted by the German government and set for approval by parliament next year would make BAWe responsible for fighting market manipulation including the key prerogative to file civil claims against suspected offenders From January the authority will also be responsible for enforcing Germanys first compulsory takeover code Meanwhile despite opposition from the insurance industry and regional central banks a draft bill by the finance ministry should result in the merger next year of BAWe with the federal bank and insurance regulators into a centralised financial supervisor Yet there is no plan to give the watchdog authority over the Frankfurt stock exchange The separation of roles with each state being responsible for policing stock exchanges on its territory is above all historical says Mr Wittich We have a high quality of supervision but a rapprochement in this respect which should be a matter the federal and state governments is something to think about for the future Germanys courts chase after companies UKs FSA Consults On Implications Of Basel Accord Delay Dow Jones November By Sarah Turner The UKs financial watchdog the Financial Services Authority said Tuesday that it has set out for consultation the implications of a oneyear delay to the revised Basel Capital Accord on integrated prudential supervision for UK financial firms The new Basel Accord framework is intended to improve the safety and soundness of the financial system by placing more emphasis on banking internal controls and management the supervisory review process and market discipline These international initiatives have been delayed until at least the start of The FSAs director of prudential standards Clive Briault said the FSA was previously planning to implement its integrated prudential sourcebook at the start of in line with the implementation of the new Basel Accord and related new European Union legislation Briault said we believe that we should not defer all the benefits of integrated regulation simply on account of the delays in international discussions He added that our preferred option is to implement as much as possible of the sourcebook early in while deferring those parts which will or may have to be changed significantly as a result of the international discussions Key candidates for implementation in are sourcebook provisions relating to insurance companies Lloyds insurance and friendly societies Briault said other areas suitable for early implementation are systems and controls investment firms not covered by

Enrons Success Story The Wall Street Journal The International Swaps and Derivatives Association released its first survey of the global overthecounter credit derivatives market last month showing a total notional outstanding volume of credit derivative transactions of billion as of the end of the first half of this year ISDA which compiled information from firms hopes the survey will provide a benchmark from which to chart future growth in the credit derivatives market This survey and the others that have been done by Risk the British Bankers Association BBA the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency CC and the Bank for International Settlements BIS have all used different methodologies on different samples and have generated varying results Risks survey last year showed significantly higher total notional volumes billion The BBA survey released in July also gave a higher figure forecasting billion for the end of The BJS plans to publish its triennial figures on the credit derivatives market later this year Upward trend According to ISDA while still modest in relation to interest rate products the credit derivatives market is expected to remain on a strong upward trend compared to more mature derivatives product areas Most major dealers say there has been a big increase in their credit derivatives volumes Mike Brosnan deputy comptroller of risk evaluation at the CC pointed to a challenge in assembling these surveys When you conduct a survey some people may or may not respond hence the data could be incomplete A problem with a survey is who is the enforcer The OCC which carries out its own quarterly review of the US derivatives market showed a decline in the credit derivatives market from billion at the end of to billion at the end of secondquarter Brosnan attributes the decline in the credit derivatives market to uncertainty among users relating to restructuring issues sparked off by the US life insurer Consecos debt restructuring last year However according to Tim Frost head of JP Morgans credit derivatives business in London the decline evidenced in the OCCs figures really comes down to a change in reporting methods that occurred in from grosstonet notional figures on outstanding credit derivatives contracts Enrons Success Story The Wall Street Journal December The collapse of Enron was many things a gratifying slap in the face to corporate hubris and an exposure of the Alfred E Neuman club of stock analysts rating agencies and the SEC It may even prove to be a fascinating look into criminal minds But there is one thing for sure it wasnt a market failure To the contrary Enrons implosion was confirmation of the principles that govern competitive markets Enrons success and failure ran along the lines set down in any microeconomics text The company discovered a new product mostly ways of trading energy in the derivatives market that allowed producers and users to lay off risk This new product was wildly popular and as the innovator Enron made lovely abovemarket returns But those abnormal returns attracted other firms into the business and Enrons advantage was gradually competed away Each new market entrant put the squeeze on Enrons margins What happened next is still a matter of speculation but there are several theories that seem reasonable Bad hedging Although Enron started out as a plain vanilla energy company it shed those hard assets that could have underpinned its financial business and morphed into a trading company and then quickly into a hedge fund The Dismal Science A trading company can make money no matter which direction the market goes by simply trading and taking its money from creating a market If prices are falling then suppliers rush into the market to get contracts that nail down prices if prices are rising then users rush in to get contracts Traders can make money either way Indeed in this model a volatile market is the best of all possible worlds But with its margins and cash getting squeezed Enron started borrowing money and pretty soon it was running with remarkable leverage thus becoming a giant hedge fund When things started to go wrong Enrons traders quite possibly were panicked into trying to hit a home run That is they started taking big bets on the direction of the market perhaps taking aggressively long positions in energy A successful hedge fund however depends on adequately hedging bets especially leveraged ones But as Enron started to lose money on its big bets observers guess that the insufficiency of its hedges began to look lethal There are also more complicated theories that argue Enron was hiding its slowing growth in earnings with various accounting strategies Bad trading Enrons main technique to pump up earnings probably revolved around a looseasagoose process for the accounting of energy derivatives Called marktomarket the technique involves evaluating contracts at fair value prices Since some of these contracts stretched out for years the futures market provides no firm prices And absent a liquid market with clear prices fair value becomes a mugs game in which companies can vastly inflate value These overstated gains of course were also unrealized noncash gains In September Jonathan Weil a reporter for the Journal took a look at Enrons second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings Enron would have had a loss Mr Weil later found that for the year as a whole unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the companys originally reported pretax profits Hardly a confidencebuilder in the quality of Enrons earnings When their derivative strategies started to go sour this theory runs Enron removed the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in special entities created for just that purpose Bad Assets Another theory locates Enrons earning problems in their hard assets Enron had a bunch of huge and underperforming assets like its broadband company water company and power plants in India and Brazil In order to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs either with bank loans or money provided by Enron itself These partnerships allegedly transferred enough control to third parties to get them off Enrons balance sheet Enron guaranteed these deals with make good provisions backed by Enron stock a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of the partnerships When the value of the assets tanked the makegood provisions kicked in resulting for example in the enormous writedown in shareholder equity in November Depending on which theory one accepts there are two bottom lines The first holds that the sagging earnings problem was fatal and that it is entirely possible Enron was in the process of liquidating itself Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates hypothesizes that Enrons cost of capital was higher than its returns on invested capital A second argues that if Enrons managers had been content to accept the fact that in competitive markets their first mover advantage was going to be competed away and had been willing to endure slower earnings growth it would not be in bankruptcy today Enrons collapse also says something valuable about the energy trading markets Competitive markets worked just as expected As questions were raised about the quality of Enrons earnings and just as important not answered investors grew wary Although the stock opened the year trading in the s it started drifting down as investors bailed The stock had already lost half its value and was trading below before the company announced a big thirdquarter loss and made its first disclosure of accounting mistakes in October At the same time traders outside the company had begun to unwind positions and do business with other firms At the end of September Enron had of the energytrading market Just two months later its business had disappeared but that disappearance didnt cause the tiniest ripple in the market The swift collapse of what once was a billion dollar company failed to generate either a price spike or a supply interruption because the market was sufficiently liquid and deep to absorb it In short no matter how one views the purposes or operations of a competitive market the history of Enron proves that the market works pretty much as expected And thus the story of Enron is so far a success story End of ISDA Press Report for December THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF

ISDA and FpMLorg to merge Risk A spanner in the works Risk December When the Basel Committee issued its second consultative document proposals CP for a new regulatory capital Accord in January it prompted fierce opposition from banks academics and lobbying groups over its treatment of loans to small to mediumsized enterprises SMEs This sector is the backbone and growth engine of many major economies Now nearly a year later the issue has come to a head The US and Germany which is fiercely protective of its SME sector the mittelstand are engaged in brinkmanship over the capital treatment of loans to SMEs that could cause the entire Basel II capital Accord to unravel SME lenders initial concerns included the steepness of Basels credit risk weighting curve for the internal ratingsbased IRB approach its insistence that expected loss provisions should be made in addition to typical unexpected loss provisions confusion over which SME loans could be included under the retail approach and the extent to which physical collateral could be used as a risk mitigant The Committee has moved to address many of these concerns although some like the risk weighting curve remain prickly But a critical issue the use of maturity adjustments in the calculation of capital charges for corporate and SME lending which requires banks to put aside more capital for longerdated loans is far from being settled The German banking industry in particular is worried that overly harsh SME treatment would push up lending costs thereby stifling capital to a vital source of the countrys economic growth While German banks have several concerns the countrys lack of flexibility on the maturity issue threatens to derail the entire Basel II process which in turn would throw the European Directive based on Basel II into disarray While most Basel lobbying has been carried out via traditional banking channels with national banking associations petitioning their regulators that sit on the Basel Committee and its working groups the debate in Germany Europes largest economy involves the highest levels of government German chancellor Gerhard Schrder and economics minister Werner Mller said in late October that German funding to the mittelstand must not be impaired by Basel II Basel II is not acceptable to Germany in its present form Everyone must reckon with our opposition to a European Union guideline based on Basel II said Schrder referring specifically to treatment of SMEs The Basel Committee has since issued a paper Potential modifications to the Committees proposals which outlines current thinking within the Committee and indicates that it will make key concessions to SME lenders The most important aspect of the paper released November is the Committees move to lower and flatten the IRB risk weighting capital curve which is a function of a firms probability of default This significantly lowers capital requirements for SME lending The move is based on evidence that small companies are less likely than large corporates to default during economic downturns But the paper failed to touch on the maturity debate It says nothing about maturity just about the risk weights without any maturity adjustments says Tobias Winkler head of international banking issues in the department for banking supervision at the Bundesverband deutscher Banken Association of German Commercial Banks This a right step but certain additional things have to be done to take account of special circumstances of SME lending in Germany he adds The maturity adjustment has to be abolished in the advanced approach he argues The German side claims the terms of loans to the mittelstand are significantly longer than those to their SME counterparts in the US or the UK We have got very long maturities this would put German banks at an enormous competitive disadvantage compared with other countries says Winkler Evidence to support this argument is hard to come by especially since the Basel Committee refuses to disclose crosscountry comparisons for factors like average loan maturities from its second quantitative impact study QIS But several officials with access to QIS data say the average maturity of loans made by domestic financial institutions to businesses in Germany is years a figure that falls to years for Germanys internationally active banks Average maturities for business loans in other G countries were said to lie between two and years The CP proposals for Basel II contained two maturity approaches in IRB treatment one called the default model ironically said to be a German proposal and the other a US marktomarket approach strongly backed by the British Under these two approaches it is assumed that the risk of default on a loan is higher if it is longerdated an assertion that has been supported by several studies of historic data The marktomarket approach also takes into account the economic deterioration of the position and not just final default This Anglo model heavily penalises longerterm loans According to the Zentraler Kreditausschus ZKA a central banking association which represents the interests of German commercial banks savings banks regional state banks and cooperatives longterm exposures of seven years could require up to six times as much capital as one year exposures although one German banking official said a cap had now been placed on maturities at five years reducing this figure to Capital addons for longterm loans would therefore seriously affect the international competitiveness of the German banking industry and result in higher interest rates for borrowers that would not be justified by the risk exposure said the ZKA in a statement during the comment period But Germany stands virtually alone in its refusal to accept the USled maturity proposals The data analysed by the Committee clearly shows that you have these upwardsloping curves for maturities What kills a bank is deterioration of value and it has got to provide for a lot of things on the books so you cant wait for final default said a Basel Committee member But you can argue about the steepness and that is a matter for debate The fact that Germanys other key allies in the wider SME debate namely Japan Italy and Spain are in favour of maturity adjustments has prompted a number of nonGerman regulators albeit veiled behind the protection of anonymity to play down the importance of the maturity impasse to Basel IIs implementation But such views fail to take into account the depth of feeling that German banks banking associations the Bundesbank parliament and the general public have in protecting funding to the mittlestand This unusual level of pressure has left the German negotiators with very little room for manoeuvre Gerhard Hofmann director of banking supervision at the Deutsche Bundesbank was one of the few regulators prepared to speak publicly on the issue He said his hands were all but tied on the maturity debate and confirmed that the German side would be prepared to scupper Basel IIs timetable should a deal fail to be reached If this does not come to an end then the European effort will be postponed too I have difficulties imagining that we would introduce Basel II in Europe and not have a level playing field on a G basis While Hofmann said the matter was very serious he remained confident that all sides could reach a solution Compromise Risk was told by one European banking representative who claims to be closely involved in the talks that a current compromise suggestion is to halve the US marktomarket maturity adjustments This would mean the figure mentioned in the ZKA paper for a AAArated sevenyear loan would be reduced to But a US representative distanced himself from this being a US proposal I would not describe the negotiating position that way he said Asked if the US team would agree such a concession he added I couldnt say that we would but it would depend on the whole package Fifty per cent on the marktomarket adjustment seems an obvious point to try and compromise on but Im not sure the US side would agree to that Hofmann was also cautious saying I would rather hesitate to comment on that but yes it is a direction we are heading This is a critical point and I hesitate to comment in public because we are in the midst of this rather difficult negotiating process and I really dont want to jeopardise anything It will be quite tough While almost every country that supports maturity adjustments believes a markdown would be an acceptable compromise Germany may still hold out Another German bank executive says it may find a markdown unsatisfactory Another area of potential compromise is to allow banks with loan maturities of less than three years to gain a downward capital allocation adjustment while banks with loans of more than three years would be capped at the threeyear level as factored into the current proposed standardised credit approach But German bankers appear set to resist even this level of compromise claiming that German internationally active banks with average maturities of years would be on an unfair playing field with other internationally active banks which have average maturities closer to the two years But German banking officials could not come up with hard data to support the claims While maturity is the largest single SMErelated issue for the Basel Committee to resolve there are a number of other matters that also need clearing up and once again the Germans are digging in their heels For example the IRB credit riskweighting curve proposed by the Committee on November fails to completely assuage concern about higher SME lending charges While Basels current approach would mean that banks would have to set aside significantly less capital against SMEs which typically fall in the to probability of default range compared with CP proposals charges are still higher than under the present rules For example a bank lending to an SME with a probability of default would now have to set aside of the capital compared with under the January proposals Collateral mitigation could reduce this to and receivables mitigation might further reduce the amount to But Hofmann believes this riskweighting curve does not go far enough When you look at the curve the typical probability of default range for an SME which is around still triggers a capital charge of above percentage points above the current treatment he says This will translate into the pricing of these loans How big will the interest rate effect be on SMEs According to our calculations it is still significant Hofmann says As a result the Bank of Italy and the Deutsche Bundesbank drafted a confidential joint paper released October which was submitted to the Committees working group on overall capital The paper proposes that a function based on the relationship between asset correlation and size should be added to the IRB riskweight curve methodology based on the relationship between asset correlation and probability of default The paper Calibration of benchmark risk weights in the IRB approach to regulatory capital requirements contends that joint treatment of probability of default and a firmsize effects on asset correlation could produce a risk weighting function that addresses both procyclicality issues produced by the new framework and concerns related to the treatment of lending to SMEs The Committee is now investigating the matter as part of an additional quantitative impact study QIS But many banks including German financial institutions are strongly opposed to the introduction of additional parameters such as number of employees assets and turnover functions into the riskweighting curve They see a size function as an unnecessary complication Segmentation on the grounds of turnover is unsatisfactory to us Retail businesses and wholesale businesses may have similar turnover but the characteristics and the way you would manage them in risk terms would be quite different says Colin Jennings senior manager nonretail related risk at Lloyds TSB the UKs third largest bank If that was imposed on us we would have to change our systems considerably to do what we think would achieve no real benefit adds Simon Baker Lloyds TSBs head of risk policy overseeing about billion in commercial portfolios above million in turnover and an equal amount in small business portfolios plus retail loans to its million retail customers base Further effects Bankers are also opposed to another key aspect of Basel II that affects SME lending The Committee believes banks should put aside capital for expected losses in addition to the current practice of making capital charges against unexpected losses credit risk From a theoretical view of capital such requirements should be fulfilled by future margin income and not by regulatory capital allocations The Germans favour this pure approach Expected losses are covered by future margin income We dont need any double counting by using regulatory capital to cover expected losses says a German banker Although Basel has made some concessions in this area saying it would scrap expected loss provisions for retail loans excluding mortgages and allow deductions from special and general loan loss reserves against expected losses the Committees inelegant solution has again run into German opposition The German Ministry of Finance restricts the amount of loanloss reserves due to fears that banks would attempt to reduce their income figures to avoid tax payments says one German banker We fear that this could lead to a severe international competitive disadvantage for German banks because of tax regulations so we are very much against covering expected losses with regulatory capital A potential solution is to include expected losses under Pillar II of Basel II leaving it up to the discretion of national supervisors to ensure expected losses are fully covered while ensuring a level playing field among nations But some claim the Committee is unconvinced that expected losses are fully accounted for by national regulators in specific product areas or nations like Japan and have pushed for specific Pillar I treatment to alleviate their concerns The current envisioned compromise is that this will not be done across the board While it is not an elegant solution it addresses the most important substantive concerns the industry has raised about the inclusion of expected loss says a Basel Committee member The strong German opposition to so many SMErelated treatments will make a speedy resolution difficult with much said to be hinging on sideline discussions between the German and American contingents ahead of the Capital Task Force and Basel Committee meetings scheduled for December and in New York and the December and in Basel respectively With the timing tight in terms of enshrining a European Directive in European Union and European national legislation the industry needs a major breakthrough based on sound banking supervision practices rather than an appeasement in response to political sabrerattling which risks weighing down the entire Basel II process ISDA and FpMLorg to merge Risk December By Rob Dwyer The International Swaps and Derivatives Association plans to integrate FpMLorg the notforprofit company set up to develop Financial products Markup Language FpML into its organisational structure by the end of the year The merger of the two organisations is aimed at facilitating the development of FpML by allowing FpMLorgs members to concentrate on technical issues Mart Meinel cochair of FpMLs standards committee and head of fixedincome IT at UBS Warburg says becoming part of ISDA will remove the burden of administration from the technical team We will be able to use ISDA resources which will speed up the implementation of version and the development of version he says The standards committee ended up doing a lot of the administration work to run the FpML symposiums and we hope to leverage off ISDA conferences for future symposiums FpML based on the flexible extensible markup language XML is designed to create an industry standard for electronic trading FpML launched in July covers interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements FpML is presently working on version which will include swaptions caps floors collars and straddles as well as several other instruments as well as those covered in Implementation is slated for the end of December The committee is also planning to publish a draft of which will extend FpML coverage to foreign exchange and equity derivatives by the end of this year Meinel says FpMLs integration with ISDA was part of the standards committees strategy from the organisations inception Since we have been working on ISDA documentation then converting that into XML our work has a natural fit with ISDA says Meinel Operating from inside ISDA will help the development of FpML be better aligned with the documentation of new products as it comes along Strain Robert Pickel ISDAs chief executive officer says the merger will allow members of FpML to focus on technical development But will it prove a strain on oftenstretched ISDA resources We envision adding some extra staff and we project that we will be able to find the extra funding needed through duebased revenues says Pickel As a volunteer organization it was an issue for FpML members to find time aside from their day jobs And yet they have still managed to establish FpML as a brand that is the basis for OTC derivatives transactions in the future he adds FpML users welcomed the announcement Mark Brickell chief executive officer of online swaps trading platform Blackbird and chairman of lSDA between and says We actively encouraged ISDA to take on this project Creating FpML is as important as the ISDA Master Swap Agreement because it will strengthen the framework for the swap negotiation Brickell says Blackbird was the first company to offer FpML confirmations to its customers and he believes ISDA will accelerate the adoption of and expand FpML further to cover more kinds of transactions more quickly Observers say the success of the project depends on recruiting An official at an FpMLaffiliated company says ISDA hasnt had this level of technology project before so the key will he whether it hires someone with the requisite level of technological expertise ISDA officials say details about FpML recruitment have yet to be finalised End

Swaps Law Dow Jones TRADING PRACTICE A Derivatives Odyssey FOW US Fed Treasury SEC CFTC Survey Recommends No New Swaps Law Dow Jones December By Rebecca Christie WASHINGTON US financial market regulators recommended no new legislation to regulate swap agreements involving customers with low net worth according to a study released Thursday by four federal agencies The US Treasury the Federal Reserve the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a joint report on retail swaps Thursday assessing whether there was a need for further regulation A swap is a type of financial transaction in which two parties agree to exchange payments or securities over a period of time Swaps contracts are generally used by large institutions to hedge risk such as interestrate risk or currency risk Retail swaps involve customers who are not eligible contract participants under federal law This group includes individuals who have less than million in assets or less than million under certain conditions as well as nonfinancial entities that have total assets of less than million and do not use swaps as a normal part of their business Retail swaps are not covered under recent legislation that regulates derivatives The study released Thursday surveyed representatives from dealers a derivatives trading system and a trade association The joint report said that the four agencies do not currently see a need to regulate most swaps involving these small customers with the possible exception of energy swaps Should regulators see a need to oversee energy swaps current legislation appears to give the CFTC some latitude to act the report said If interest in energy swaps were to outpace the current scope of the CFTCs authority Congress might wish to step in at that time the report said A Derivatives Odyssey FOW December The derivatives industry in has experienced continued consolidation among users and exchanges Electronic trading practices have further penetrated into traditional procedures while exchanges have reaped healthy revenues from derivative contracts One product that has swept across the worlds derivatives exchanges this year is the single stock future London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange Liffe launched its Universal Stock Futures in January to great fanfare but only moderate success Nevertheless exchanges in Europe and Asia rushed to jump on the single stock bandwagon Anxious not to miss out on the action the US repealed the ShadJohnson accord in place since which prevented investors betting on the future price of individual stocks The repeal was set to become effective on December but has since been postponed to the end of March Bill Rainer who was chairman of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission CFTC at the time of the repeal notes that while the bill is generally sound it is still within the period of industry comment Rainer has since moved on and is currently heading one of the newest single stock ventures between Chicago Board of Trade CBoT Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME and Chicago Board Options Exchange CBOE This remarkable alliance pools the resources and liquidity of the three exchanges giving serious competition to American Stock Exchange Amex and the joint offering between Liffe and Nasdaq While the single stock futures will be offered to alt qualified market participants Rainer feels the product will not be suited to all sectors of the market They are likely to be more attractive to the institutional sector than the individual sector because institutions have the resources to educate themselves about the value of the product and its place in their strategies he explains Nevertheless he is confident in the products value as a useful risk management tool for any practitioner However confidence in single stocks is far from unanimous Not withstanding the hype dissenters note that the volumes in single stocks are subdued around the world The start of trading in the US may give them a muchneeded boost but as yet the money is going elsewhere The evolution of the index derivative product business has been the most significant development in says Uwe Velten at European derivatives exchange Eurex and he thinks it will continue This is just the beginning of a strong product group Index products are one of the most intelligent tools to manage risk with he assures As they are a trend in the market we encourage them in our portfolio Velten notes that the importance of index products has increased with their expanding geographical scope For years futures and options on the Dax was our only index product Then we expanded our product offering beyond national products ParisBourse Swiss Exchange Deutsche Bourse and Dow Jones created Stoxx in early to provide a Europeanwide family of indices When Eurex was created we captured all euro Stoxx business and today we average around contracts a day and this is growing Velten explains Now we have moved into global offerings with Nymex futures and options and sector index products from Dow Jones which are growing from a small base This is what the future will bring The business is growing in Europe with sector index products and globally with the new Global Titans products Eurex has experienced growth in index products this year compared with growth in capital market products and the fixed income sector and growth in stock options Eurexs fiveyear German government bond Bobl contract was the fixedincome headline grabber of When one market player successfully manufactured a bobl squeeze in March by cornering the market in the physically deliverable futures contracts Eurex needed to act fast to avoid a repeat performance in September In an overhaul of its securities regulations the exchange introduced position limits on the futures contracts and crucially rectified the discrepancy in penalty charges for the late delivery of underlying securities with drastic cuts The fixed income community offered only timid approval however and few believed a squeeze could be fully avoided Sensing opportunity in the air Euronext Paris relaunched its fiveyear European government bond futures contact in a bid to capture market share from disenchanted Bobl traders A deal between Eurex and the German finance agency Bundesfinanz Agentur finally stretched the September Bobl with an agreement to supply additional bonds in case of another shortage By extending the pool of deliverable securities the Bobl looks set for an easy ride this December However the longterm future of government debt markets in general still hangs in the balance Both sides of the Atlantic have suffered a dearth of government bonds amid treasury buyback programmes and cuts in issuance this year Most recently the US Treasury stopped issuing year bonds in November Subsequently investors have begun to favour the swaps market to hedge their interest rate risk Many market sources and the Bank for International Settlements claim that interest rate swaps are the leading candidate to replace government securities as the leading capital markets benchmark In March as the fragmented government bond market continued to shrink amid highprofile contract squeezes Liffe entered the fray hoping to mop up business with a family of eurodenominated futures on interest rate swaps collectively named Swapnote Contrary to the many doubts over the products ability to capture liquidity from the OTC market it attracted substantial interest The success of the contract in Europe convinced Liffe to make plans for expansion into the US market with the eurodenominated swap futures with speculation of a US dollar swap contract to follow Witnessing the success of Swapnote and conscious of its faltering Tbond future CBoT introduced a suite of swaps derivatives that made a promising debut in November Nicholas Neubauer chairman at CBoT explains the concerns underlying the decision Earlier this year there was a feeling that the amount of publicly available Federal debt would decline to zero over the next five to ten years We therefore wanted to offer our customers a swap contract as an alternative tool While these new swap contracts have proved highly popular they must be seen in perspective for example while Liffes daily average for Swapnote is around contracts Eurexs tenyear bond averages nearer Nevertheless it is a product class with great potential As Neubauer says If it is going to be a winner it will be a big winner Volumes in the options market have been thriving in A single day record of m was notched by CBOE in April which is now in competition with five other options exchanges in the US We are very pleased with this years performance especially in light of the increased competition both domestically and internationally says Edward Provost executive vp at CBOE However all has not been plain sailing and the options market has suffered upheaval with the move to decimalisation In the case of options this change required a substantial technological effort to trade decimals instead of fractions comments Provost It also has a significant impact on the way options traders operate even more than on the stock side The move to modernity was sanctioned because a stock price quoted in fractions forces an artificially wide spread But while decimalisation allows for many more potential price points for a stock it subsequently creates an amplification of complexity for options pricing This increased capacity for market quotation results in an increased number of market floatation updates explains Provost So it was all about operational preparedness and adapting systems for a surge in business For CBOE the change to decimals went very smoothly Electronic trading Technological upheaval has affected many derivatives exchanges in and the troubles at CBoT have been symptomatic of the industry as a whole By the end of there was a great deal of doom and gloom on the trading floor about the impact of electronic trading says Nicholas Neubauer Our business model of openoutcry trading was being slated for early extinction in favour of electronic matching engines On top of this he explains plans to become a forprofit organisation were seen as simplistic and caused two lawsuits with the CBOE In addition the ceo of years left Having set forth a programme of ten promises including modifying the restructuring plan hiring a high quality ceo and settling the law suits Neubauer has now put the exchange back on track Meanwhile Ace the electronic trading joint venture between CBoT and Eurex has been the subject of much wrangling over maintenance responsibilities However the platform averages around contracts a day accounting for roughly of business Generally we have found that on volatile days people use openoutcry and on slow days Ace increases its market share explains Neubauer During volatile periods traders get more information out of a central marketplace than the more sterile environment of screen trading After the heartache that electronic trading and Ace in particular caused it was Aces performance that fuelled the exchanges return to profit in September Teething problems with new electronic trading systems have been rife among many derivatives exchanges this year As CBoT and Eurex feuded over Ace London Metal Exchange saw a lacklustre response to Select picking up slightly after a phase two launch in October and New York Mercantile Exchange argued with the providers of Enymex However Liffes Connect system has been the key to the revival of its fortunes After a few false starts Connect has quickly gained acclaim for its superior matching and distribution capabilities Liffe won its first major deal with Nasdaq to list futures on single stocks on Connect Then in July Liffe agreed to provide Connect products and services to Tokyo Financial Futures and Options Exchange Tiffe In an alliance similar to Ace the Connect link allows Tiffe and Liffe members to trade on one anothers exchanges It was Liffes aptitude with derivative technology that placed the company on a firm footing for Novembers merger In October CBOE launched CBOEdirect to a modest reception The system will operate in pretrade hours initially with options on the Dow Jones Industrial Index CBOEs Provost explains that a feature of the system is underscoring the worlds altered preoccupations One benefit of beginning to use screenbased trading is that it is a very logical and viable disaster recovery trading system This is something we and other exchanges are looking at Of course any retrospective on would not be complete without mention of the World Trade Centre tragedy During this terrible time the financial community came together with firm resolve to help colleagues and competitors alike in an unprecedented show of solidarity There was a defiant determination to keep financial markets

North American Edition Rome did not cheat over deficit Financial Times European Edition EMERGING MARKETS Cavallo defends Argentinas plan for debt swap Financial Times OPERATIONS After Liffe The Economist TRADING PRACTICE Cut Short The Economist Italy rebuts claims over swap contract Financial Times North American Edition November By James Blitz The Italian Treasury firmly rebutted allegations on Monday that it had structured a complicated swaps contract with the aim of deflating its budget deficit figure and qualifying for the single European currency In a formal statement the Treasury said that swap contracts in which a bond issuer can trade his obligation to make payments in one currency rather than another were a regular method of improving management of public debt Privately meanwhile Treasury officials sought to explain why Italy had undertaken a swap contract highlighted over the weekend by a report for the International Securities Market Association On May the Italian government issued a bond for Ybn At the time after the dramatic devaluation of the lira the Italian Treasury was gradually seeking to regain credibility in international markets and did so by issuing bonds in a range of currencies When the Ybn bond was issued the yenlira exchange rate was at L By December however the yen had depreciated by per cent to a level of L to the yen The Treasury then sought to lock in its currency gains over this period Treasury officials say they could have undertaken to start buying back the Ybn bond issue but given its sheer size this was unrealistic They therefore decided to undertake a crosscurrency swap in which the Treasury could convert its yen liabilities into lira The Treasury faced a serious technical problem however Under European Union statistical rules pertaining at the time the debt of all EU countries could only be reported in the original currency in which the bonds had been issued in this case yen Any swap contract agreed by the Treasury in order to close its foreign exchange risk would thus be irrelevant when it came to calculating the overall debt figure This was highly pertinent to how the swap agreement had to be structured The Italian Treasury could have simply closed the swap transaction when the Ybn bond matured in September realising all its exchange rate gains at that date But a strong appreciation of the yen during the course of might have left Italys official debt looking higher at the end of that year than it did at the end of This could have seriously undermined the countrys bid to enter the eurozone The Treasury therefore needed to keep the formal calculation of its debt consistent by realising their exchange rate gain during the lifetime of the bond Both the exchange rate and the interest rate of the swap contract were structured to allow this Treasury officials say the per cent foreign exchange gain from the Ybn bond was highly unusual They dismissed any notion that this could be a regular phenomenon in debt management as absurd Nor say officials could the swap be judged as a way of window dressing the deficit figure If window dressing had taken place Italy would have seen its deficit and debt shoot up after it had successfully entered the single currency The fact remains that Italys deficit and debt have both been on a steadily downward path since Rome did not cheat over deficit Financial Times November European Edition By Peter Norman The European Commission and Eurostat the European Unions statistical agency yesterday rejected suggestions that Italy had used the overthecounter derivatives market to camouflage the true size of its budget deficit and so help its admission to the European single currency Gerassimos Thomas spokesman for Pedro Solbes the economic and monetary affairs commissioner said the Commissions preliminary evaluation was that the use of interest rate swap transactions by one member state in as highlighted in an International Securities Market Association ISMA report did not amount to cheating on the budget deficit figures Mr Thomas said the purpose of such swap transactions was to save money for governments and they were therefore not discouraged by regulators Although the ISMA report referred only to an unnamed member state it was understood to be Italy Yves Franchet the directorgeneral of Eurostat said his agency knew in about the Ybn Italian bond issue and swap transaction mentioned anonymously in the report The effect of that deal was to reduce Italys deficit of around per cent of gross domestic product in by a marginal percentage points The swap deal was therefore not of a size to influence significantly Italys ability to produce a deficit well below the per cent ceiling set in the Maastricht Treaty Mr Franchet said Eurostat consulted widely on how to treat swaps before defining the deficit of Italy and other member states The agency had to work out the public deficits of member states for economic and monetary union at a time of statistical transition between national accounts based on a standard known as ESA which took no account of swaps and before formal adoption of the ESA system which recognised swaps After consulting with expert committees Eurostat decided to apply the ESA standard in calculating member states suitability for Emu Aware that swaps could have a positive or negative effect on deficits Eurostat also conducted a survey of swap use by member states According to Mr Franchet the practice was not widespread Cavallo defends Argentinas plan for debt swap Financial Times November By Thomas Catan Domingo Cavallo Argentinas economy minister yesterday mounted a defence of his countrys controversial debt swap plan saying investors must accept lower interest payments if his country was to avoid an outright default on its Dollars bn debt Any reasonable person knows that Argentina cannot grow if it has to pay interest on its debt that ranges between per cent to per cent and in the case of some provinces up to per cent a year he told an audience of businessmen We seek to ensure payment on the basis that Argentina is viable and to stop trying to pay interest rates that only reflect the march of Argentina towards default Its a question of telling the truth Starting today Argentina will offer private creditors new bonds backed by future tax revenues that will pay a maximum of per cent Repayment on bonds coming due in the next years will also be pushed forward by three years Mr Cavallo said This leg of the debt restructuring appears to be aimed mainly at domestic investors local pension funds insurance companies and banks that hold at least a third of Argentinas Dollars bn in bonds These local institutions often units of international banks are heavily exposed to Argentine debt and are seen as more susceptible to government pressure A second global exchange for all of Argentinas bonds should be ready within months Mr Cavallo said By then Argentine officials hope to have additional guarantees from multilateral lending agencies to offer foreign investors in return for accepting lowerinterest bonds Argentina hopes this will enable it to avoid an outright default on its debt Investors entering the first mainly local exchange will be entitled to enter any subsequent deal Mr Cavallo said Pension fund managers had feared being taken to court by future retirees for having acted against their interests Those who have confidence in Argentina are going to have two opportunities because no one knows if the global exchange will have better or worse terms Mr Cavallo said Argentina is attempting to cut its annual interest bill by at least Dollars bn to free up resources to restart its ailing economy now in its fourth year of recession To do so the government is implementing a range of tax cuts and other measures to spark spending such as cutting employees private pension contributions Investors remain concerned that Argentinas debt proposal effectively constitutes a default However Mr Cavallo is now putting them on notice that they must accept lower interest payments if the country is to continue to service its debt The government is also pressing the provinces to accept a cut in their guaranteed monthly tax transfers After Liffe The Economist November JEANFRANCOIS THEODORE the head of Euronext is a surprise winner The London Stock Exchange LSE was widely expected to triumph in the bidding for Liffe Londons derivatives exchange Yet on October th the board of Liffe recommended that its shareholders accept a m m offer from Euronext the threeway merger between the Paris Amsterdam and Brussels stock exchanges Although Euronexts offer was less than the LSEs it was all in cash not in combination with shares It also promised to retain Liffes management and to shift all of Euronexts derivatives business to London to trade on Connect Liffes trading system That combination made it unbeatable Euronexts coup is a blow for the LSE which had hoped that buying Liffe would strengthen its position in the forthcoming consolidation of European stock exchanges But the LSE misplayed its hand advertising its interest for too long in advance and then quibbling over too many details with Liffes management It will now have to find some other strategic option if it is not to become prey to one of its rivals Setting up its own derivatives business will be hard it might instead seek to buy one of the American exchanges perhaps the Chicago Mercantile The third big European stock exchange Deutsche Brse which had also bid for Liffe will also have to find an alternative Yet one obvious idea to resurrect last years abortive marriage between it and the LSE will be hard to do under the two exchanges present management because the bustup was so acrimonious That may put Euronext in the best position to become the dominant European exchange Europes investors may not care so long as trading becomes cheaper and easier Anyway most of them fret more about improving clearing and settlement in Europe which is much more expensive than in America and so offers greater scope for savings The LiffeEuronext deal immediately triggered speculation about which European clearing houses might now merge The London Clearing House LCH which clears trades on Liffe had inconclusive talks last year with Clearnet which clears Euronext trades A merger would now be logical Less obvious is which way the Luxembourgbased Clearstream will jump On October st it received offers from Deutsche Brse which already owns and Brusselsbased Euroclear the biggest clearer of international bonds Deutsche Brse is keen to own all of Clearstream This would create the first big European silo in which trading clearing and settlement have a single owner Werner Seifert chairman of Deutsche Brse has long championed silos which he thinks provide the reliability required by the market Critics reckon vertical silos distort competition Benn Steil at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York says that Deutsche Brse might impose discriminatory tariffs on nonGermanbased traders in German shares if it were to own all of Clearstream Others point to possible crosssubsidy from the monopolised settlement arm to the trading platform One alternative is the horizontal integration of settlement agencies and clearinghouses to create large central counterpartiesmaybe two or three for the whole of Europe Traders would then be able to net their cash and derivatives positions on several exchanges with a single clearing house saving capital Don Cruickshank chairman of the LSE thinks the European Commission in Brussels should go further and impose a single European clearing and settlement system like Americas That is a very long shot It took the intervention of Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission to set up the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporationwhich moved American nongovernment securities markets from seven settlement agencies to one settlement organisation and one central counterparty Besides the defenders of silos the European Commission would have to contend with a different regulatory and legal system in each member country More realistically market forces will drive clearing and settlement houses to join forces because it is more costefficient when buyer seller and security are linked Cut short The Economist November The American Treasurys announcement that it will issue no more year bonds should delight corporate treasurers and depress fund managers Cynics also suggest that Peter Fisher undersecretary at the Treasury made this move to help Alan Greenspan chairman of the Federal Reserve Board bring down longterm interest rates in a fair imitation of a bull market The year Treasury bond has been illiquid for some time because until recently America had been retiring debt Now that the country is a net borrower again it is the wrong time to take longterm debt off the menu say Mr Fishers critics Many have a vested interest however The Chicago Board of Trade which usually carries great clout in Washington immediately protested that economic uncertainty since September th obliges the Treasury to keep all its funding options open including at the long end It is worried about losing its flagship yearbond futures market Bond traders as well as interdealer brokers such as Cantor Fitzgerald will now have to satisfy themselves with shorter maturitiesthese are more liquid but with less of the volatility that dealers love Those traders and investment banks that cover their year trading positions with repos bond sales and repurchases will find life more expensivethey will ultimately have to buy and sell corporate bonds which carry credit risk rather than supposedly riskfree government bonds Perhaps they will use British year gilts instead There are winners Swap dealers and longterm bond issuers notably two government agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should find more demand for their year bonds It will please too those who think interestrate swap rates a better benchmark than Treasuries for pricing fixedincome securities The biggest gripe will come from insurance companies and pension funds with longterm liabilitiesespecially definedbenefit pension plans Longterm rates may be lower but will now come with credit risk attached Surely Mr Fisher read a paper published in July by the American Academy of Actuaries entitled The Impact of Inordinately Low year Treasury Rates on Defined Benefit Plans If he did this plea to spare the life of year

Dow Jones Credit Derivatives FOW November By Jane DouglasJones In the weeks following the terrorist attacks in the US credit derivative traders reported record levels of activity In the immediate aftermath of the events of September trade ticket size went down says one broker A lot of people were prepared to make markets in m or euros where previously the average ticket size was m The nominal size of the trade went down as a result of the level of uncertainty and volatility in the markets Traders report that credit default swap trade volume soared to three times the normal level If nominal ticket value went down by half and trade volume went up threefold overall volumes were up by in terms of the actual business being written explains the broker After the initial shock of the devastating attacks the market recovered its poise and analysts and traders soon realised the credits that would be most affected Clearly airline stocks took a pummelling says one trader Prior to the event British Airways was trading around basis points for five year default swaps After the attacks BA widened dramatically to SOObp Spreads on this credit did come in from this level but they have since gone back out again and are currently trading around bp Meanwhile we saw a credit event on Swiss Air and German airline Lufthansa also went out with all the European airlines following suit Insurance sector As was expected the credit derivatives market also saw heightened activity in the insurance and reinsurance sector There has been a lot of activity around companies such as Zurich Re says the trader Zurich spreads moved out from around bp to bp The credit did trade towards the offered side once or twice Zurich spreads have stayed in this range despite the fact that the company has downsized its profits and upsized its predicted loss effectively doubling the amount of provision as a result of the terrorist attacks Similarly names such as AXA Agon and Aliance have all been actively quoted in the aftermath of September and spreads have widened considerably on these names For example as FOW went to press Aliance spreads went out to Obp before tracking back in to bp In addition sectors that have not been considered directly affected by the attacks such as the auto sector also moved out as a result of the potential slowdown in the US We have seen principle investors in the credit derivatives market trading either with a view or going by what the spot markets are doing says one dealer We have also seen quite a few investors gaining synthetic exposure to bonds by selling default swaps Recent weeks have proved a significant test of the liquidity in the default swaps market In some areas the bond market was extremely thin and it was difficult to trade However with default swaps there was always a price in no more than five minutes The market was both traded and tradable Europe The European credit derivatives market has also had to contend with the demise of the UKs train operator Railtrack Railtrack is going to be a credit event on bankruptcy rather than restructuring says one structurer There was a thought initially that it would go via restructuring and that would have been an interesting test of the modified ISDA restructuring supplement This is still very much an issue in the market While the US has adopted the new version by far the majority of business being done in Europe and Asia uses the original ISDA definition of restructuring The new restructuring Z supplement has simply not been accepted and I do not think it ever will be accepted I expect that we will soon move back along the lines of the original ISDA wording with perhaps one or two tweaks Overall traders say that the market has survived the seismic shock of the events of September extremely well There was no mad panic says one broker The credit derivatives market made a fair and measured response in the face of tragedy ISDA publishes amendments to master agreements IFR November As part of its effort to improve counterparty risk management practices the International Swaps and Derivatives Association last week released nine amendments that can be added as attachments to ISDA master agreements Many of the changes included in the document were inspired by the market turbulence in ISDA said Ultimately the amendments will form the basis of an initial draft of a new master agreement Using one amendment a failure to pay becomes a default one local delivery day after notice of such failure is given to the relevant party Many market participants found three local business days after notice to be too long a period during times of market stress in ISDA noted in a commentary on the amendments A local delivery day is a day on which settlement systems are generally open for business Under a second amendment market participants can use a replacement value method of valuing transactions after early termination of a master agreement The replacement method combines elements of the market quotation and loss methods into one valuation provision SDA said noting that the quotation or loss methods are still valid Because the inability to communicate notices via email or fax proved unduly restrictive in an amendment was added allowing market participants to use these channels to give notices An amendment stating that the occurrence of termination events should be treated in a manner similar to an event of default also featured on ISDAs new list of amendments that may be tacked on to master agreements According to ISDA this option was added because a number of members hold the view that most termination events are creditrelated ISDA initiated a review of its master agreements provisions in The process took into account recommendations by the counterparty risk management policy groups report Improving CounterParty Risk Management Emerging market issuers press ahead Financial Times November By Arkady Ostrovsky Emerging market borrowers are pressing ahead with planned international bond issues despite a deepening debt crisis in Argentina Fitch the credit rating agency yesterday said Argentinas planned debt swap would amount to a default Fitch cut Argentinas credit rating from CC to C indicating an imminent default and left it on rating watch negative Although the proposed debt exchange has been described as voluntary public statements by Argentine officials imply that in the absence of such an exchange public debt held by domestic investors is unlikely to be serviced Fitch said Fitch also said the terms of the new instruments would be inferior to those of existing debt including lower coupons and longer maturities However despite all this emerging markets remained surprisingly calm with no visible signs of contagion developing Emerging markets bond spreads had hardly moved since last Fridays announcement and the yield spread of some countries including Brazil had even tightened This is because there is little leverage in the system compared with the Russian crisis and because most market participants were prepared for an Argentine default Several emerging market issuers said they were pressing ahead with bonds despite Argentinas troubles Bulgaria is likely to launch its debut eurodenominated international bond next week Its finance minister said yesterday the country would not launch the bond if it had to pay a coupon above per cent But bankers close to the deal were confident Bulgaria could borrow at between and per cent or between and basis points over the eurozone benchmark depending on the maturity Bulgaria is considering a threeyear or fiveyear issue of up to Euros m Emerging market analysts said Bulgarias economy was in good shape despite eurozone economic slowdown and falling export revenues The country rated B by Moodys and B by Standard Poors has attracted healthy levels of foreign direct investment by selling its banks to foreign banks has pegged its currency to the euro and has met several Maastricht criteria Bulgaria is the final country to offer extra value as an EU convergence play It is unrecognisable as the state engulfed by crisis five years ago said Charles Robertson emerging markets analyst at ING Barings Latvia which is on a roadshow in London today is also pushing ahead with a bond issue Sibneft Russias oil company said it would also go ahead with a threeyear Dollars m bond issue this month although other oil companies have chosen to postpone their issues until next year If successful Sibneft could become the first Russian corporate to issue international bonds since the crisis Moodys yesterday assigned Sibneft a rating of B a notch above Russias sovereign credit rating Dumping W FOW November By Jane DouglasJones Basel Committee for Banking Supervision has been busy in recent weeks The Committee has issued guidance to banks on customer due diligence processes reviewed its Internal Ratings Based Approach EBB to specialised lending exposures and published crucial papers on operational risk and market discipline In addition the credit derivatives market breathed a sign of relief at the Committees decision to dump w In the first of a series of updates on the proposed new Basel Capital Accord the Basel Committees Capital Group has decided to incorporate the w factor a residual risk charge for credit derivatives into pillar two of the Accords framework which deals with the supervisory review process This move was welcomed by the banking industry and the International Swaps Derivatives Association ISDA neither of which has been backward in expressing disapproval of w The news that the charge is to be assimilated elsewhere in the Accord came as no surprise given the uproar since ws birth in the January Basel consultative paper As FOW reported see May issue Its the end of as we know it page the charge was derided at ISDAs AGM by the very regulators one would expect to defend it and the future of the w factor has looked bleak since then However some market participants were worried that the Committee would stand by the charge both because of the immaturity of the credit derivatives market and also because of the worry that credit risk management instruments could be used for regulatory arbitrage Any sign of traders using a derivative to get around a capital charge or regulation has been in the past punished by conservative and complex rules says one source Recent evidence of this can be found in the securitisation market The demise of w has not meant the end of regulator concern about credit derivatives The Capital Group states One of the Basel Committees objectives in considering the treatment of credit derivatives in the trading book is to minimise the possibility of regulatory arbitrage the Capital Group is planning to specify a rule that is already implemented by many supervisors This rule provides that when a bank conducts an internal hedge of a banking book exposure using a credit derivative in its own trading book in order to receive any regulatory capital benefit it must transfer the credit risk to an outside third party ie an eligible credit protection provider Meanwhile the Accords addon matrix for potential future exposure calculations does not explicitly cover credit derivatives and rules differ across countries The Capital Group is working to provide proposals that will harmonise this treatment Op risk The Risk Management Group RMG of the Basel Committee has also been hard at work The Group has made a number of significant changes to the January proposals including Refinement of the definition of operational risk Proposed reduction in the overall level of the operational risk capital charge from to Introduction of a new regulatory capital approach that is based on banks internal risk estimates the Advanced Measurement Approaches AMA Consideration of the role of insurance as a risk mitigant in the regulatory capital calculations The Group now defines op risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events Due diligence In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the US in September the Basel Committee has issued guidance and minimum standards to banks on customer due diligence processes Systemic customer due diligence is an essential element of banks risk management says William McDonough chairman of the Basel Committee It is critical to safeguarding confidence and the integrity of the banking system The importance of a rigorous approach has been underscored by the recent terrorist attacks in the US Basel Committee IOSCO IAIS Publish CrossSector Reports Dow Jones Newswires November LONDON Two crosssector reports aimed at supervisors in the banking securities

Intangible Assets Disclosure Decision BNA CREDIT DERIVATIVES Railtrack Swissair First Test of Europes Default Swap Market Bloomberg REGULATORY Canada Publishes Final Regulations To Implement Financial Services Framework BNA RISK MANAGEMENT The Case for Catastrophe Bonds TRADING PRACTICE End Of Cantor Treasurys Quotes On Telerate Causes Bother Dow Jones FASB Adds Performance Reporting Project Defers Intangible Assets Disclosure Decision BNA October NORWALK ConnThe Financial Accounting Standards Board Oct formally added a project on performance reporting to its rulemaking agenda but it deferred a decision on whether to start a separate standardsetting effort on disclosures about intangible assets The topic of intangibles was the subject of extended debate among FASBs seven members as they weighed its importance in allocating staff resources to such a project or to two other issues vying for the attention of rulemakers FASB heard arguments from one board member John Wulff suggesting that an effort to simplify and codify standards and other guidance that form statements of generally accepted principles together with writing standards on revenue recognition and defining liability may be more suitable candidates for rulemaking Major US corporations through at least one trade group the Institute of Management Accountants counseled the course described by Wulff a former leader of Financial Executive Internationals Committee on Corporate Reporting That committee opposes FASBs taking on the performance reporting and intangibles projects as outlined in a prospectus issued about two months ago FASB settled on a compromise plan offered by board Chairman Edmund Jenkins In the compromise the panels staff will carry out further preparatory work on intangible assets At the same time FASBs staff will study the three potential projectsrevenue recognition and liability definition simplification and codification of accounting rules and disclosures about intangibleswith an eye toward deciding an appropriate use of staff accountants time The additional work on intangibles is to focus on summarizing existing research on such nonconcrete assets as inprocess research and development patents and customer lists with particular focus on questions about what information on intangibles is useful to investors security analysts and other users of financial statements FASB would not carry out polling or surveys the board emphasized The board tentatively set a deadline of Dec for completion of the twopronged work by its staff That timetable would suggest FASB plans to make a more definitive decision on adding a second or even a third standardsetting project in early Minimum Approach in Performance Reporting Effort FASBs new rulemaking on performance reporting represents an effort to improve and make more useful information displayed on all the basic financial statements both interim and annual In such a display and presentation project the board would not address recognition and measurement questions according to a staff summary FASBs staff recommended that the board stick close to what is known as the minimum approach in the performance reporting project said Ronald Bossio a senior staff project manager Pursuing that approach was the avenue favored by most of the boards constituents who expressed support for starting the standardsetting effort The minimum approach is described by FASBs staff as one that would have the board explore whether certain line items subtotals and totals should be defined in standards and required to be displayed in financial statements including interim statements Line items and amounts that would be considered include those related to metrics commonly used by investors and creditors in assessing financial performance the staff continued in a summary distributed at the boards Oct meeting Favored less by constituents and not advocated so far by any board member in preliminary discussions is a broader approach Under that FASB would describe how key financial metricsusually ratios or some other indicatorshould be calculated if they are presented in financial statements However the methods of figuring such metrics would not be required to be shown in the financial statements according to the staffs summary of the broader path Gary Schieneman a veteran security analyst who joined FASB in July said he supports taking on the project on performance reporting He added however I think it will be difficult to stick closely to the minimum approach Michael Crooch a colleague on the board said he too supports the rulemaking effort but voiced a concern that the effort may be a project that has no bounds This is one we have to watch with regard to scope The International Accounting Standards Board has begun its own standardsetting on performance reporting That task is being carried out jointly with the United Kingdoms Accounting Standards Board in an effort in part toward helping ensure convergence of financial reporting rules around the world FASB plans to monitor the IASBASB joint project Defining Simplification Wulff a former highranking financial executive at Union Carbide who joined FASB with Schieneman first raised the issue of perhaps taking on other projectsrevenue recognition and simplificationwhen he was asked to voice a view on embarking on the performance reporting project what simplification is came to a head in FASBs debate when Wulff weighing the intangible assets project questioned moving ahead on that effort before understanding how many staff resources would be used in writing standards on disclosures about intangibles Some in the community of financial statement preparersgenerally US corporations and their trade groupsoppose FASBs taking on the performance reporting and intangibles projects Instead they suggest the accounting board should begin rulemaking on liability and revenue recognition and what the Institute of Management Accountants IMA labels FASB CodificationSimplification FASB board members and IASBs liaison to the US board James Leisenring said they know what codification means The name signifies a collection of FASBs authoritative literature and GAAP in general that should be collected in one comprehensive format as IMAs Financial Reporting Committee wrote in a Sept letter to the accounting board However several board members and Leisenring FASBs former vice chairman regarded arguments for simplification warily as shown by their comments Oct I know what codification is said Leisenring I dont know what simplification is He and FASB members Neel Foster and Katherine Schipper suggested they know what simplification could mean but did not elaborate instead making veiled references to moves such as requiring full fair valuebased recognition of financial instruments in the income statement widely opposed by banks and corporations Simplification a Complicated Effort I also know that isnt what they want Leisenring said of advocates of a simplification project He suggested that if such a project is anything like IASBs current effort to improve existing international accounting standards simplification would prove not so simpleand would consume hundreds of hours of staff time if its a serious endeavor Foster labeled arguments that FASB should begin a simplification effort an attempt to tie this organization up for the next years Schipper who alone objected to Jenkinss compromise on the intangibles project said the board should begin the rulemaking on disclosures about intangibles immediately and proceed full speed ahead Schipper cited the lack of comparability in current reporting on purchased intangible assets which are accounted for under FASBs new rules on business combinations and on intangibles that are internally generated The latter and their values often are not reflected at all in financial statements although they are said to be key drivers in the socalled new economy Inprocess research and development which figured prominently in mergers and acquisitions in the high technology sector needs a very strong look she added Schipper a former accounting professor at the University of Chicago and Duke University said of accounting for intangibles This issue has been studied up and down left and right from floor to ceiling You may think the academic research is stupid and misguided I dont she said in urging a quick start on standardsetting Other Action by FASB In other action at its Oct meeting the board tentatively decided to reactivate its dormant project on costs associated with activities stemming from disposal of a factory or other hard asset used in a discontinued business operation and reconsider all of the guidance in Issue No of FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including onetime employee termination benefits and other restructuring costs issue draft rules in midNovember to rescind FASB Statement No Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt and to make miscellaneous technical corrections including nonsubstantive changes to FASB Statement No Accounting for Leases and amendments related to FASB Statements No Business Combinations and No Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and consider at an upcoming meeting plans to reviveand most likely head in a different rulemaking direction than previously pursuedthe boards yearold project on consolidations policy or defining when an affiliate of a company should be deemed a subsidiary and have its activities included in the financial statements of the parent In previous incarnations of FASB an accounting model based on control of an entity did not garner enough support to advance to a final accounting standard and was criticized strongly by FEI and others The controlbased model departed from the traditional majority equity ownership model which several FASB members suggest is not followed in current practice despite its standing as accounting gospel Railtrack Swissair First Test of Europes Default Swap Market Bloomberg October By Tom Kohn Europes billion market for credit default swaps a form of insurance against companies missing their debt payments is getting its first test as Railtrack Plc and Swissair Group wrestle with insolvency Credit default swaps let banks and other investors juggle the risk that a bond or loan wont be paid back The buyer of such protection pays an annual premium and the seller pays if theres a socalled credit event such as a company going bankrupt Railtrack is the bigger of the two tests to the overall market said Dale Lattanzio head of structured credit trading at Merrill Lynch Co While the government said the bonds will be OK under the terms of the contract it triggered a credit event and the credit derivatives market is treating it as such Britains government seized control of Railtrack on Sunday to stop the owner of the UKs rail network going bankrupt It would have debts of million pounds billion by December and billion pounds by March government lawyer David Richards told the High Court Railtrack owes bondholders more than billion Swissair is seeking bankruptcy protection after running out of money Oct Europes seventhbiggest airline owes bondholders billion The companys market value is currently million after its shares fell percent this year Settling Claims Default swaps traded for both companies and were triggered by the announcements Were going through the process of settling claims said Lattanzio Theres a broad agreement in the Londonbased credit derivatives market and its been fairly orderly with no market disruptions Sellers of credit protection arent likely to refuse to pay out on their contracts traders said Still because the companies nearbankruptcies sparked swap payments it will test the legal contracts on which the banks rely Credit derivative agreements depend on legal documents developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association which represents about securities firms Banks use ISDA contracts for credit default swaps to ensure their agreements wont collapse if unexpected events occur ISDA defines a credit event as bankruptcy failure to pay obligation default obligation acceleration repudiation or moratorium and restructuring The likelihood is that the documentation should stand up said Ruth Ainslie senior policy director at ISDA in New York She said that depends if banks used ISDA agreements and whether or not they have been radically changed ISDA has received legal opinions on Swiss and UK jurisdiction because ISDA contracts cover a very broad range of agreements she said Consternation The UK government plans to transfer Railtracks bonds into a new company rated at least BBB by Standard Poors and Baa by Moodys Bondholders would get interest and be repaid when the debt matures at broadly the same terms Transport Secretary Stephen Byers said this week Initially there was consternation when Railtrack was put into receivership said Ned Swan a partner and derivatives specialist at law firm Simmons Simmons Still its a major company with major assets It was a surprise but these things will be worked out The Bank of England estimates the credit derivatives market has a face value of about trillion with credit default swaps accounting for about half the market London trading accounts for just under half the market Up to swaps on companies are traded with to trading actively the bank said in a June report The central bank cited British Bankers Association and US government figures as well as its own estimates The US Office for the Comptroller of the Currency reported US commercial banks had credit derivatives with a face value of billion at the end of the second quarter UK securities watchdog the Financial Services Authority monitors the banks trading credit default swaps though doesnt regulate credit derivatives We dont regulate it as a product said Karin Loudon an FSA spokeswoman Its up to the banks to manage their own legal risk UBS AG sued Deutsche Bank AG for million at Britains high court in March for failing to pay on a default swap when Armstrong World Industries Inc the USs biggest vinylflooring maker defaulted on its debt The dispute centered on Armstrongs name because the contract referred to its parent company Armstrong Holdings Inc according to the court filing The two banks settled the suit March An FSA spokesman said at the time that regulators dont typically intervene in such cases because banks usually resolve disputes among themselves Canada Publishes Final Regulations To Implement Financial Services Framework BNA October OTTAWAThe Canadian government has implemented new framework legislation for the financial services sector including domestic and foreign banks trust companies insurance companies credit unions and other financial institutions Secretary of State International Financial Institutions James Peterson said Oct Implementation of Bill C An Act to establish the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada and to amend certain Acts in relation to financial institutions coincides with the publication of a finalized package of regulations necessary to give effect to the legislations provisions Peterson said in a statement The measures contained in Bill C will help to ensure that the Canadian financial services sector continues to be among the safest and most accessible in the world he said The legislation will promote efficiency and growth in the sector foster international competitiveness and domestic competition empower and protect consumers of financial services and improve the regulatory environment The legislation also creates the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada which begins operations Oct and will enforce compliance with the legislations consumer provisions and educate consumers on how the legislation benefits them he said The new agency has been in the public spotlight recently as a necessary element of the federal governments efforts to track down and freeze assets in Canada of international terrorist organizations The Department of Finance published the finalized package of regulations in the Oct issue of the Canada Gazette Part II The regulations are particularly important because a key element of the new financial framework is the use of regulations to provide a more flexible regulatory environment for the financial sector said a regulatory impact analysis statement published with the finalized regulations This allows the government to make modest policy adjustments to the framework in response to significant changes taking place in the global environment in which financial institutions operate Many regulations are being proposed or modified in order to achieve this policy objective of creating a more flexible regulatory regime the impact analysis statement said The current proposals are the first of several packages of regulations that will be brought forward to implement the policy intent of the new Act and will include regulations essential to operation of the legislation it said Of the regulations relate to the new frameworks restructuring of the permitted investment regime while are related to the new holding company regime for financial institutions six relate to creation of the new Financial Consumer Agency of Canada six relate to changes to the foreign bank regime and the remaining eight are aimed at various other policy objectives it said Key areas of the regulations relate to the activities of banks include definition of aggregate financial exposure for banks engaging in certain transactions with related parties that are not federally regulated financial institutions limits on the commercial lending activities of financial institutions other than banks requirements for financial institutions to inform customers with a complaint about a product or service on how to contact the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada exemption of certain classes of entities from the status of being an entity associated

securities entities to hold shares of a parent bank holding company to a limit of one percent of the bank holding companys regulatory capital End Of Cantor Treasurys Quotes On Telerate Causes Bother Dow Jones October TOKYO Some Japanese institutional investors were a little peeved Thursday when information provider Telerate stopped offering Treasurys pricing from major interdealer broker Cantor Fitzgerald Securities but the change hasnt hampered trading of US government debt said Tokyo traders Telerate owned by Moneyline stopped posting Cantor Fitzgerald realtime US Treasury bond pricing on its screens globally from pm EDT Wednesday The information and data provider said it would replace the service with price quotes from rival interdealer broker BrokerTec Global LLC But as of GMT am EDT Thursday the display remained blank The reason for the change wasnt immediately clear Investors have called in to say its inconvenient that they cant check the Cantor page on Telerate and have asked about prices said a foreign securities house trader in Tokyo They are now logging onto the Cantors website or having to set up a Cantor page on a Bloomberg terminal Apart from a bit of hassle suffered by some investors however impact on trading was limited Even with comprehensive onscreen price data investors will typically phone up several brokerages to get bond price quotes before deciding to trade said a trader at a large Japanese insurance company Losing access to price indications wouldnt change that practice he added Brokerage and bank Treasurys dealers and their colleagues in the swaps market were unaffected as apparently none of them rely solely on the Telerate service for US debt security pricing information traders said Telerate continues to provide limited non realtime US government bond pricing data from Cantor Fitzgerald and other brokers on a separate display The Case for Catastrophe Bonds The New York Times October By Hal R Varian The insurance industry faces claims of at least billion tied to the World Trade Center attacks and it remains exposed to significant risk from future incidents Retail insurance companies are considering exclusions for terrorist damage leaving property owners unable to buy the coverage they need The problem lies in the reinsurance industry the wholesale market where insurers lay off large risks to pools of investors willing to absorb them Warren E Buffetts reinsurance company General Re has done well in the last few years offering property reinsurance because there have not been major hurricanes or earthquakes But its luck ran out last month General Re has said it is liable for over billion of the total industry losses in the Sept attacks Earthquakes and hurricanes unpleasant as they are present manageable risks insurers know roughly how often they occur in various places what their likely magnitudes are and how much property damage might be expected Terrorist risk is much harder to quantify leading to the current paralysis in the reinsurance market The insurance industry has been lobbying in Washington to make the federal government the insurer of last resort against terrorism which means that taxpayers will end up bearing the financial risk of future attacks Britain adopted a governmentbacked reinsurance market several years ago and so far it has worked reasonably well But there is another way to supplement traditional reinsurance markets that has been attracting increasing attention catastrophe bonds These bonds generally sold to large institutions have typically been tied to natural disasters like earthquakes or hurricanes but they could in principle be used to provide financial backing for terrorism insurance Here is how they work A financial intermediary like a reinsurance company or an investment bank issues a bond tied to a particular insurable event like a Los Angeles earthquake If there is no earthquake investors are paid a generous interest rate But if the earthquake occurs and the claims exceed an amount specified in the bond investors sacrifice their principal and interest How generous does the interest rate have to be That is left up to the market If the bond sales offer cheaper reinsurance coverage than do traditional private placements used in the reinsurance market these bonds known as cat bonds are a preferred method of finance Cat bonds are a form of contingent security a concept first formulated by Kenneth J Arrow of Stanford University winner of the Nobel in economic science Back in Professor Arrow came up with the idea of a security that would pay a fixed amount of money depending on whether or not some event occurred He showed that portfolios of such contingent securities could be used to allocate virtually any kind of risk in an efficient manner The analysis by Professor Arrow was long thought to be of only theoretical interest But it turned out that all sorts of options and other derivatives could be best understood using contingent securities Now Wall Street rocket scientists draw on this yearold work when creating exotic new derivatives There are a number of special cases of contingent securities Consider a security tied to my house burning down This would certainly affect my net worth but would have negligible impact on the owners of the other million housing units in the United States This kind of personal risk can easily be shared among many people each paying only a small amount if the event occurs and homeowners insurance is to ease this kind of risk sharing This works fine for small independent risks but there are other sorts of events that impose large costs on many people at the same time like earthquakes or hurricanes Insurance companies are able to deal with such events using reinsurance markets where the risk is transferred to large investors There are other financial institutions that also allow for risk transfer for this sort of widespread risk The orange juice futures market in Chicago is essentially a market in a contingent security tied to whether it freezes in Orlando Fla A futures market allows market participants who bear a significant risk like farmers worried that their crop might be destroyed to transfer some of that risk to others who are of course paid to absorb it The futures market allows shifting of risk rather than a simple sharing of risk Risk sharing and risk shifting are familiar terms but there is another phenomenon worth noting something I like to call risk shafting This is when some risk often a particularly large risk is transferred to a third party who is forced to bear it involuntarily In many cases these third parties are taxpayers who are not even aware of their potential liability Hence the debate that is going on in Washington now should the insurance industry be able to transfer the risk from future terrorist attacks to taxpayers Or would it be better to use existing reinsurance markets or new financial instruments like catastrophe bonds to shift the risk to those willing and able to bear it if appropriately compensated Cat bonds have some attractive features They can spread risks widely and can be subdivided indefinitely allowing each investor to bear only a small part of the risk The money backing up the insurance is paid in advance so there is no default risk to the insured As the market for cat bonds matures secondary markets may develop particularly if the bonds become standardized and bundled into portfolios If so the market price of cat bonds will reflect the market perceptions of the likelihood of the event associated with the bond just as price changes on the orange juice futures market reflect the likelihood of a freeze in Florida The market for cat bonds is still immature and is only a fraction of the size of traditional reinsurance But cat bonds and other sorts of contingent securities may well end up being part of the longrun solution to the problems of the reinsurance industry End of ISDA

European Investment Bank a multinational lender with a EUR billion USD billion loan portfolio is considering using credit derivatives for the first time as a means of hedging its credit risks next year Officials at the EIB in Luxembourg said the lender is currently conducting an internal review on the credit derivatives market and is weighing whether it makes sense to use products such as singlename default swaps to mitigate risk Credit derivatives would be a completely new field for us said Luis Pacheco an official in the creditrisk department in Luxembourg noting the bank has used foreign exchange swaps in the past on the back of its bond offerings but has not used any derivatives on its loan portfolio The lender hands out EUR billion per year EUR billion of which is within the European Union to highly rated banks and corporates Twothirds of the loans go to highlyrated banks with credit ratings in the A range with maturities of years which then loan money to small and mediumsized enterprises The remaining third goes to corporates across the credit spectrum in five to year tenors Pacheco said the EIB will accept default swaps in place of bank guarantees which it now requires as a means of hedging risk on the bulk of its longterm lending if the market is deemed liquid enough Officials were unable to quantify potential usage of credit derivatives given the early stage of the discussions Credit derivatives pros were excited to hear of the EIBs discussions Its just a matter of time until the credit derivatives market becomes more like the interestrate swaps market and what were seeing now is the initial phase said one trader adding Im not surprised Pacheco and other EIB officials said the reason behind the review is because the default swap market is more liquid and as a result may offer more attractive pricing for debtors The advantage is the portfolio approach commented one official The EIB has considered using credit derivatives in the past although it found the market was not developed enough and so we were not interested said Pacheco The supranational is analyzing the market now to see if that has changed in terms of liquidity and critical mass in the last year as is expected Now we want to see the new situation of the market and to see if we can use it in our business he said He declined comment on potential counterparties Basle study suggests changes to the Accord IFR November Banks could face higher capital charges under Basle IIs internal ratings based IRB foundation approach to credit risk reserving than its more advanced standardised approach Contrary to the Baste Committee on Banking Supervisions desired results the IRB foundation approachs minimum capital requirements would be higher among large GO banks the regulators quantitative impact study QIS found Under the standardised approach these banks would see their requirements increase on average An average change of was reached when banks were asked to calibrate credit risk using the IRB advanced approach laid out in the Committees January proposal according to the QIS released last week To address the fact that the approach slated as the less intensive yielded higher charges and to understand better the impact that the January proposal would have on small and mediumsized enterprises SMEs the Committee is conducting a followon impact study The January proposals corporate and retail risk weight curves and its method for recognition of physical collateral and receivables may be modified as a result of this study the regulator said last week The January draft was not balanced because it was biased towards the views of large banks engaged in large corporate lending activities noted one industry official The corporate risk weight curve under the new QIS is likely to reduce the capital requirements for many SME borrowers relative to the January proposal the Committee said Additional work is also under way aimed at assessing the probable impact of applying separate risk weight curves for residential mortgage exposures and for other retail exposures Under the Committees January proposal the IRB approach treated all retail exposures using the same risk weight curve The impact of assuming a lossgiven default LGD for loans fully secured by nonproperty physical collateral and a LCD for loans fully secured by receivables will be examined in the new QIS Under the January proposal banks with the foundation approach have no incentive to use most forms of collateral said Marc Intrater managing director at Oliver Wyman in New York Other than commercial and residential property collateral the January proposal did not recognise physical collateral or trade receivables as collateral As such loans fully secured by either received a LGD Banks that use collateral for their secured lending and do it well generally experience a reduction in credit risk The Committees decision to undertake a followup impact exercise is widely viewed as revisionist say market participants Similar moves earlier this year appear poised to result in changes to the January proposal they note There is a lot of waiting until the final accord But most banks realise that even though the accord does not come into effect until getting ready for it requires a lot of lead time said Intrater The Baste Committee plans to release a final

in default swaps Dow Jones November By Joe Niedzielski NEW YORK Dow Jones The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has published a supplement to its document for credit derivatives which incorporates convertible bonds and zerocoupon bonds among others as deliverable securities in these contracts The trade group said late Friday that it had finalized and published its Supplement Relating to Convertible Exchangeable or Accreting Obligations The supplement addresses the treatment under the ISDA Credit Derivatives Definition of certain types of convertible and exchangeable obligations as well as the treatment of accreting obligations such as zerocoupon bonds low coupon bonds issued at a discount and nondiscounted bonds that accrete during their term ISDA said The Convertibles Supplement represents the consensus of a diverse range of constituents in the credit derivatives markets including portfolio managers credit protection sellers and dealers said Robert G Pickel ISDAs executive director and CEO Credit default swaps allow buyers to transfer the risk of a default on obligations like bonds or loans or other types of credit events like a debt restructuring They have had a growing influence in the broader fixedincome universe at times playing a role in the pricing of corporate bonds And some convertiblebond investors will lay off the credit risk from the fixedincome portion of a convertible security by buying credit default swap protection ISDAs supplement was expected A group of USbased dealers submitted a proposal to ISDA a few months ago to include obligations like convertible bonds as deliverable securities in these contracts And in midOctober ISDA told members that convertible bonds were deliverable under standard credit derivatives contracts The groups memorandum to members came in response to questions from members following the appointment of a railway administrator for Railtrack PLC URTK Holders of convertible bonds issued by Railtrack had complained that some sellers of credit protection werent paying claims on default swap contracts on the Railtrack credit The Basel perplex The Economist November The arcane world of banking supervision is not usually the talk of German chancellors on tours of Asia Gerhard Schrder made an exception recently when he threatened that Germany would veto any new European directive based on the latest proposals from the Basel committee of bigcountry bank supervisors In its present form said Mr Schrder in Bangalore Basel as the proposals are known is unacceptable to Germany Basel attempts to formulate more precisely than before the levels of regulatory capital that banks must hold as a cushion against the credit and other risks that they run After more than three years of talks the Basel boffins have developed rules which are still not acceptable to commercial banks That is strange since they are supposed to mirror the way the worlds most sophisticated banks themselves calculate their risks The whole exercise has shades of Heath Robinson about it The banks are up in arms this week bearding the Basel committee for its latest draft rules which get ever more complicated and prescriptive By the time they are implemented in at the earliest the rules look likely to burden banks with extra costs ie through the need to run parallel reporting systems and perverse incentives to game the system Basel could thus aggravate the very thing it set out to correct a distortion of financial markets Germanys grouse has to do with the Mittelstand the m small and mediumsized companies that are the economys backbone The Basel formulae for credit risk are based on credit ratings applied to company debt either by rating agencies or internally by banks themselves But few smaller companies are rated in this way Moreover German companies are more than usually dependent on mediumterm bank loans and the longer the loan the more it is penalised under the proposals The Germansbut also the Italians and the Japanesefear that their mediumsized companies will lose under the new capital regime Many of the German banks are not equipped to rate the companies to which they lend equipping them would drive up the cost of lending German bank associations plan to help by pooling credit data for their members But Mr Schrders advice to banks last week was that they should not be overhasty in applying the new Basel principles ahead of time Already the committee is working on a fix On November th it posted a clutch of new suggestions on its website that included new risk weightings for smaller companies and proposals that physical collateral receivables and even leased assets be used to lessen a particular companys credit charge These were interim ideas it said which needed to be tested and even revised All well and good But the Basel committee is getting into knots trying to address every objection as it arises Each time it seems the committee adds another layer of complexity for banks and their supervisors to master Most recently after strident objections by banks there was the shifting of the wfactor the possibly unquantifiable residual risk in a credit derivative from one supervisory category to another and also the setting of arbitrary minimum risk weights for unrated securitised assets The figure for operational risk nonmarket risks such as the loss of data a rogue trader or the destruction of a banks headquarters has been slashed after objections from banks The November th pabulum came in response to a quantitative impact study a live study of how the proposed capital charges would affect a sample of banks in countries The Basel committee has always said that the scale of charges needs to be properly calibrated In fact it gave itself an extra year to get the calibration right It has invited some banks to take part in a fresh impact study using its latest proposed adjustments The results should help the Basel committee to tweak its formulae to get results Its declared goal is not to increase or decrease the overall capital charge imposed on the banking system merely to allocate it more efficiently But some regulators are worried that the more risksensitive the regime is the more reluctant banks will be to lend in a downturn aggravating economic cycles There are attempts to fix this too For example Spain allows its banks to make a provision at the inception of a loanputting money aside for a rainy day Some countries need to fix their accounting regimes before they can follow suit Regulators appear stoically optimistic that all these fixes will work and that a credible new framework will be establishednot without flaws perhaps but better than what exists today The timetable may slip but the plan is to produce a final draft framework early next year allowing consultation until the end of March which should result in a firm set of rules by the end of That in theory still allows time for the European Union to draft and finalise a matching directive on capital adequacy for banks and financial firms to be in force by January With Basel bank supervisors are trying to do three main things They want to devise formulae that bring capital charges closer to the banks own measures of risk They want to establish continuous review of banks management and especially of their risk management as a factor in adjusting the capital charge And they want to create incentives for greater public disclosure of banks risk exposures This is an attempt to let markets take on more of a supervisory role Yet in reality the supervisors are becoming micromanagers A member of the Basel committee insists that most of the worlds banks will be governed by a regime no more complex than Basel in force today The more sophisticated financial groups that aspire to a socalled advanced approach will be treated differently Well be crawling all over them initially says the supervisor because ultimately were giving them more freedom All the same in between the lowest and the highest thousands of banks will be graduating from a standardised to a more sophisticated approach with heavy demands on supervisors time Only America and Britain already have a culture of continuous review by supervisors Most other regimes are either less sophisticated or they are hamstrung by nonadjustable capital charges that are set at a minimum by law Then there is the Brussels hurdle Whatever the Basel committee decides works for banks must be applied in the European Union to all investment firms including brokerdealers and asset managers The scope is huge for further descent into mindboggling detail Supervisors and financial firms may well end up thanking Mr Schrder if he vetoed the lot Supervisors review crosssectoral practice IFR November The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision the International Organisation of Securities Commissions and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors last week released under the banner of the Joint Forum two reports comparing risk management practices and principles in the sectors they supervise Both reports were principally aimed at the supervision of conglomerates that incorporate businesses in banking securities and insurance but one also took a close look at risk transfer practices The first report Risk Management Practices and Regulatory Capital compared the approaches in each sector in an effort to gain a better understanding of current industry practices in all three sectors The main sections of the report focus on differences in core business activities similarities and differences in risk management tools approaches to capital regulation in the three sectors and crosssectoral risk transfers and investments It is in relation to the latter two sections that the report provided what some may regard as its sting The Joint Forum suggested that as supervisors evaluate the extent of crosssectoral activity in terms of risk transfer using derivatives securitisation and other techniques It may become important for the individual sectoral frameworks to be updated to better reflect the contemporary risk profiles of the firms subject to those frameworks It would not be surprising for example for some jurisdictions in the near future to consider greater convergence in the frameworks applied to the different sectors The report explained that supervisors should consider the potential for existing capital regulations to provide incentives for capital arbitrage To the extent that some firms are engaging in activities that are not addressed through capital requirements supervisors need to ensure that other measures are in place to ensure that the associated risks are being appropriately managed and are supported by sufficient economic capital it added As a result the report said supervisors should continue to evaluate approaches that could be taken to address crosssectoral investments within the various capital frameworks The second report Core Principles compared the core principles each supervisor has issued to its respective sector as risk management guidelines The Joint Forum found that each set of core principles provided an overview of the essential elements of the supervisory regime in that sector at the time they were written However the pace of developments in the financial sector since then has required consideration of the need to keep the core principles updated The report found no evidence of underlying conflict or contradiction between the three sets of core principles at the highest levels However in some cases there are significant differences in the application of similar principles End of ISDA Press Report for November THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF

Devalued The Wall Street Journal RISK MANAGEMENT Basel II Accord in danger of failing says German banker Risk News Argentinas Cavallo Insists The Peso Wont Be Devalued The Wall Street Journal November By David Luhnow and Michelle Wallin If Argentinas financial crisis gets much worse the country would adopt the dollar or euro as its official currency rather than allow the Argentine peso to devalue and trade freely on the open market Argentine economy minister Domingo Cavallo said Thursday In an interview the architect of Argentinas decadeold monetary regime under which one peso equals one dollar said Argentines accustomed to a stable currency would never accept a peso floating freely on the open market the policy adopted under past financial crises by Latin Americas two largest economies Brazil and Mexico The peso would be repudiated just as the austral once was said Mr Cavallo referring to Argentinas doomed former currency So the peso only makes sense will only continue to exist if its backed by dollars and at a onetoone parity or linked both to the dollar and euro he said For this reason we maintain that in extreme circumstances its much more logical to say Well only use the dollar or Well only use euros or another credible currency he said Read the full text of an exclusive interview with Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo As Argentina endures its fourth year of an economic slump which Mr Cavallo described as a depression local union leaders and some foreign economists have called for policymakers to let the peso devalue making Argentine goods less expensive abroad But with of bank accounts in dollars along with most contracts like rental agreements undoing such de facto dollarization would be impossible to implement or enforce Mr Cavallo said The Harvardeducated economist insisted Argentina will never give up convertibility which allows both currencies to exist side by side But Argentines dont necessarily believe that They have pulled nearly billion out of the countrys banks so far this year That has left the central bank with only about billion of hardcurrency reserves in excess of the money in circulation If that cushion were to disappear then the system would be sorely tested Once hailed as the engineer of an Argentine economic miracle in the early s that ended decades of runaway price increases Mr Cavallo years old has come under fire during his second tenure which began in March after the first two economy ministers under President Fernando de la Rua quit Although Mr Cavallo inherited an economy mired in a long recession he has been unable to generate growth Meantime creditors have demanded everhigher interest rates to lend to the country Argentina finally admitted this month it cant pay its growing interest bill asking lenders at home and abroad to take huge writeoffs on as much as billion in bonds The country is weighed down by overall debt of billion But the man at the center of the storm famous for his temper looked relaxed and confident Thursday after clinching a longawaited deal with opposition governors of Argentinas biggest provinces to carry out big spending cuts saving the federal government some billion a year in tax transfers The deal is key for Argentina to convince creditors like the International Monetary Fund the country will balance its books for the rest of this year and next This ratifies that in Argentina our elected officials are in the end coming together to resolve problems he said US Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill who has opposed fresh financial aid for Argentina gave the country a vote of confidence Thursday saying the situation has become quite encouraging He praised President de la Rua for personally getting involved in negotiations to lower interest payments on Argentine debt Hes not crying for huge volumes of new additional money Hes saying we the people of Argentina led by the president are going to figure this out and create sustainable conditions Mr ONeill said Messrs ONeill and Cavallo will meet today to discuss the countrys debt crisis which some ratings agencies have labeled a default and ways to get Argentinas economy going again Argentinas current plan to get investors to exchange their current bonds for ones that pay less interest could hit legal problems if foreign creditors decide Argentina hasnt provided enough guarantees of repayment and is favoring local investors over foreign bondholders Mr Cavallo said that wont be the case The offer for foreigners will have terms that are very equitable compared with what we are offering Argentine investors he said The offer to local investors would exchange bonds paying an average interest for new notes paying no more than but will have what Argentina claims are better guarantees since the notes will be backed by tax revenues Local banks and pension funds have until next Friday to complete the deal Mr Cavallo said Details of the offer for foreign creditors are expected in the next few months Separately Mr Cavallo said Argentina will end the year with a federal budget deficit of no more than billion If bondholders agree to take the debt exchange on offer he added then the deficit could come closer to the billion promised to the IMF at the start of this year For next year Mr Cavallo pledged a balanced budget He said the government plans to cut spending by billion in addition to the billion it expects to save from lower tax transfers to the provinces If the government saves billion from restructuring its debt as it also expects the total billion in savings should more than cover any shortfall in revenues even if the economy were to remain sluggish he said Basel II Accord in danger of failing says German banker Risk News November By David Keefe November The Basel II bank capital Accord is in real danger of failing unless clear solutions are found to several open questions about the Accord a senior German banker told a conference in London yesterday One of the key issues is the way lending to small to mediumsized enterprises SMEs known as mittelstand in Germany could be choked off by the credit risk capital charges proposed in the Accord said Wolfgang Hartmann member of the managing board of directors at Germanys Commerzbank He was speaking at a banking conference organised by the Financial Times newspaper He noted German Chancellor Gerhard Schrder has threatened to veto Basel II unless the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision the architect of Basle II and the body that regulates international banking agrees fair arrangements for SMEs The complex riskbased Basel II proposals will determine from what proportion of their assets large international banks must set aside as reserve capital to guard against banking risks including credit and market risks as well as for the first time operational risk Bank lending to SMEs which Hartmann described as the backbone of German business is traditionally long term Under the current Basel II credit risk proposals longerterm lending will attract higher capital charges than the shorterterm lending more customary among banks in other major economies That said the German government and the Bundesbank could discourage lending to German SMEs which often have weak equity bases and are more dependent on bank borrowing Hartmann said Commerzbank is strongly committed to SMEs and has a large number of customers among them Clearly Basel II must come up with an answer to the political issues if it does not want to endanger the overall acceptance of its rules he said Basel II will also fail if a respectable number of international banks do not develop a track record for the different internal ratings based IRB approaches to calculating credit risk capital charges under the Accord Hartmann said Commerzbanks goal for is to obtain certification for the IRB foundation approach while starting to collect necessary data for the more complex IRB advanced approach That would enable Commerzbank to switch to the advanced approach as soon as possible Hartmann said But Hartmann said the incentives to progress beyond the standardised approach the simplest of the three methods of calculating credit risk charges under Basel II were not strong enough and must be changed He said the current caps on the two IRB approaches would limit the benefits to banks of using these more complex methods adding that he hoped the new calibration of risk weights promised by the regulators would meet this requirement Hartmann said the Basel Committees paper on potential modifications to the Basel II proposals issued earlier this month was a step in the right direction The Basel Committee hopes to issue its third consultative paper on Basel II in late February next year and publish the final version of the Accord by the end of Basel is intended in the first instance for international banks of the Group of l leading economies but is designed for

swap master agreement to the European market which reduces documentation to a onepage confirmation form The master agreement is based on the International Swaps and Derivatives Association credit derivatives definitions but of the clauses that are typically subject to agreement are standardised under the shorter master agreement leaving only eight clauses to be agreed for each trade The two banks said that use of the new master agreement would allow quicker trade confirmation reduce operational risk and should eventually improve market liquidity They did their first trade using the new master agreement last Tuesday and had closed a total of six deals using the new form by Friday The two banks London offices typically trade credit derivatives with one another five to times a week The new agreement had not been adopted by any other dealers by the end of last week and traders expressed some surprise that the two US banks had launched the document on their own without consultation under the aegis of trade group ISDA That would have taken quite a long time and at the end of the day these are bilateral contracts said Guy America European head of credit derivatives trading at JP

why it would not be rolled out to end users of the product said Annabel Littlewood European head of credit derivatives trading at Morgan Stanley She added that JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have agreed to use the new master document in trades between their New York dealing desks with amendments to be made for local market practice US dealers typically use the modified definition of restructuring as a credit event and two weeks ago they dropped the use of the obligation acceleration clause as a standard feature of default swaps Banks move to boost credit derivatives liquidity Risk News November By John Ferry JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have agreed to standardise most of the items on their European credit swap master agreements in a move designed to increase liquidity in the credit derivatives market By cutting the widely used International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA documentation down from several pages to just one the banks aim to minimise the time taken to execute and confirm a trade while reducing documentation risk Frequent credit swap traders will be able to increase the volume of confirmed trades thereby increasing market liquidity and growth of the credit derivatives business said the banks in a joint statement Standard ISDA master agreements for credit swaps have negotiable items JP Morgan and Morgan Stanleys shortened version leaves only eight items open to discussion The banks said the onepage confirmation form contains only the key commercial terms including the name of the underlying company the notional involved and the price and duration of the trade The banks claim this will eliminate the risk of a party missing a modified term or adding terms that were not previously agreed Guy America head of European credit derivatives trading at JP Morgan Chase in London said the development of the credit derivatives market will receive a boost as a result of the agreement The new agreement now looks very similar to an interest rate swap contract he said Annabel Littlewood head of European credit derivatives trading at Morgan Stanley in London said it took around a year to finalise the agreement Its been quite a struggle getting to the point where dealers agree on the major terms in the contracts Fitch Plans Credit Hiring Spree Derivatives Week November Fitch plans to hire six or seven collateralized debt obligation professionals for its Londonbased CDO rating team because of the increase in the number of deals coming to the market Mitchell Lench senior director in London said it has about CDOs in the pipeline this month in comparison to five or six this time last year approximately onethird of these are synthetic or balance sheet transactions Lench expects the new recruits to start in the first half of next year and to come from structuring houses investment firms or competitors The hires will include a lawyer familiar with the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations documentation There are currently professionals in the CDO team in London Lench said it is becoming easier for rating agencies to hire top personnel because the wage differential between the agencies and the sellside firms has decreased He added recruits also join rating agencies for job security and to get a birds eye view of the market CrossBorder Security Transactions Costing More Than Domestic Ones EC Says BNA November Despite an increase in the demand for securities by foreign investors because of the euro there is a highly fragmented system in the European Union when it comes to crossborder clearing and settlement concluded a new report published Nov on behalf of the European Commission Moreover the cost of clearing and settling a foreign security transaction can be times as much as a domestic sale There is no European financial market right now and one has to wake up to this reality said Alberto Giovannini the chairman of a group that wrote the report Legislative Proposal Planned As a result of the report the EU executive body said it will begin a legislative process in to reverse the inefficiencies in the EU system At the same time the commission urged financial markets to find marketbased solutions within the framework of the EU competition law The additional cost and risk associated with a fragmented clearing and settlement infrastructure represents a significant limitation on the scope for crossborder securities trading in the EU said EU Economics Commissioner Pedro Solbes By extension it also represents an important limitation on exploiting the economic benefits of the internal market and the euro Three Main Problems Cited The three main problems highlighted in the report are as follows national differences in technical requirements and market practice national differences in tax procedures issues relating to legal certainty While the report says financial markets could do much when it comes to convergence and ensuring interoperability as regards technical requirements and market practices across national systems it is up to governments and the European Commission to deal with matters related to taxation and legal certainty Enter the FSA Financial Times November Midnight on Friday will be a historic moment for Britains financial services industry At that hour its new system of regulation under the Financial Services Authority will come fully into effect more than four years after it was first proposed by the Labour government How the FSA handles its new powers such as personal fines for wrongdoing by directors will have a profound impact on the City of London and its place as a global financial centre It will be closely watched by countries considering a similar move The legislation that created the FSA rightly amended to curb its powers to punish is broadly sensible The authority replaces selfgoverning industry bodies that have not always regulated consistently or with sufficient bite The aim is to make regulation more efficient and more alert to the scandals that have regularly plagued the City The legislation leaves wide discretion to the authority But Sir Howard Davies its chairman has promised a new and sensible riskbased approach resources will be focused on preventing problems where failure is most likely rather than on routine visits to well run companies Better businesses should enjoy a lighter regulatory touch That is fine in principle but the City awaits the new policeman with apprehension There are three main worries First that it will prove heavyhanded There are widespread complaints that while senior FSA staff are excellent more junior ones still suffer from a boxticking mentality Compliance costs it is said have been rising a particular worry for small companies Second there is concern that the authority may stretch itself too thinly A recent report on Equitable Life criticised the FSAs role including its poor internal co ordination Third there is a fear the FSA will adopt an excessively aggressive approach in its pursuit of wrongdoing particularly for the newly created offence of market abuse and might go for some early highprofile scalps The authority denies this as well it might A reputation for inquisitions would serve it ill Some of the Citys concerns stem from natural tensions between regulator and regulated But the FSA which can sometimes appear overly sensitive to criticism needs to be alert to these anxieties if it is to start on the right note The main test will be to produce a flexible lowcost regime that is firm yet fair while encouraging innovation and Londons growth as a global centre This will be a difficult balance but the FSAs short life so far offers hope that it will get it broadly right FSA to open securitised derivatives to retail sector Risk News November The UKs financial watchdog Financial Services Authority FSA plans to allow retail investors to invest directly in securitised derivatives for the first time by initiating a flexible listing regime The proposals which will be relevant to issuers of listed securities and derivatives have been released in a consultation paper Proposed Listing and Conduct of Business Rules for Securitised Derivatives after discussions with market participants and international regulators The idea to list retail covered warrants was first raised by the FSA in January this year The new proposals offer a wider and more flexible regime that includes other types of derivatives The paper details the determination of who can issue securitised derivatives and the information about these products that must be disclosed The FSAs proposals focus on establishing the suitability of retail investors to purchase securitised derivatives and the qualification of IFAs independent financial advisers and brokers to advise on derivatives The listing of securitised derivatives will also include a risk warning with full disclosure of the risks associated with these products alongside details of the product how it works and how the investors return is calculated Issuers of securitised derivatives will also need to be regulated by the FSA and permitted to conduct business in derivatives Ken Rushton director of listings at the FSA said Market participants believe there will be a demand for these products which are very popular in some European countries The FSA believes there is the potential for the market in the UK for these products to be substantial if UK investors show a similar appetite for these products as they have for other products such as spread betting and options Dealers hope for clarity on swap books IFR November Some clarification is expected this week on how the US courts may rule on the Internal Revenue Services challenge to dealers methods for valuing income from swaps Closing arguments in Bank One Corporation v Commissioner are set to begin on Wednesday Although no decision is expected before March or April next year the nature of the questions asked by the judge during the closing arguments may be telling industry executives believe The IRSs case is that the method for valuing First Chicagos swaps portfolio between and included inappropriate downward adjustments for credit risk and administrative costs This the IRS alleges led the dealer to underestimate the value of its income from derivatives and thereby reduced its taxable income base Bank One acquired First Chicago more than three years ago Bank One claims that the method used was common practice at the time In a brief filed this summer the bank also said that its numbers were more accurate with the adjustments than without It is proposing to use an adjusted midmarket approach to valuing income from swaps To the annoyance of some in the derivatives industry the IRSs page brief submitted in September did not tell dealers what recipe they should use for valuing income from swaps They only put forward a brief saying that the way Bank One did it was wrong one firms lawyer said The governments position cant be applied somewhere else And it doesnt tell an IRS agent how to audit another dealer The IRS was not under any obligation to come up with a better method though this would have been helpful the lawyer said The problem with an acrossthe board use of a midmarket approach of the type used by Bank One is that banks using this approach rarely mark up their valuations because of their own credit risk said Darrell Duffie a professor of finance at Stanford Universitys business school who is one of two courtappointed experts for the case One partial way to address this would be to disallow markdowns from midmarket value when a counterparty has the same or higher credit quality said Duffie Under a slightly more refined guideline banks would mark down swaps based on the credit quality of its counterparty relative to its own quality For example if an A rated bank issuing debt at bp over Libor signs a swap with an A counterparty issuing at bp over Libor then the swap could be marked down based on a mean relative loss rate of bp per year per dollar of expected exposure said Duffie This is not textbook perfect but would capture the majority of the effect of relative quality Also it would not require new software just a shift in model inputs for mean loss rates End of ISDA Press Report for November THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR

<21848498.1075854940702.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,smarra@isda.org,2001-10-24 10:45:22,ISDA PRESS REPORT OCTOBER ISDA PRESS REPORT OCTOBER CREDIT DERIVATIVES Documentation Into The Future FOW The Direction for Derivatives FOW Documentation Into The Future FOW October By Alessandro Cocco and Joe Kohler Credit derivatives are instruments used for buying or selling the risk that an obligor defaults on one or more specific obligations In this article we will examine the foundation stone that underpins the vast majority of credit derivative documentation the ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions pointing out some of the documentations key features and where they have already been refined The definitions are a set of contractual provisions that can be incorporated by reference into confirmations relating to credit derivatives that take the form of single name default swaps This allows parties to a transaction to use a short form of confirmation containing only the economic and dealspecific terms relating to that transaction The objective of this structure is to provide market participants with a tool for producing documentation that is sufficiently sophisticated to deal with the majority of issues arising from such transactions simple enough to facilitate rapid processing and cost effective The definitions achieve this by codifying market practices but more importantly the prospect of their generation helped to focus minds on establishing some of these practices in the first place As with all ISDA documentation the definitions allow for numerous elections to be made by the parties and the parties are also free to make whatever amendments or additions they agree by inclusion in the confirmation of appropriate language The definitions also provide for a number of fallbacks to apply in case the parties do not specify otherwise Market participants recognise the particularly important role of documentation in the credit derivatives market As a consequence of the Russian and Asian financial crises it became clear that in the case of credit derivatives more than for other derivative transactions the payment of large sums of money may depend on the interpretation of the wording of a specific clause The ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions Scope The definitions apply to credit default swaps relating to obligations for the payment of money by a reference entityWith appropriate modifications the definitions can also be used to document credit derivative transactions that refer to baskets of reference entities or to form the basis of documents relating to funded products In a transaction the party buying credit risk protection or buyer undertakes to pay the seller of protection a predetermined amount In return the seller undertakes to make a payment in favour of the buyer in case the defined credit events occur Credit events serve as indicators of the deterioration of the creditworthiness of the reference entity One of the main characteristics of a credit derivative is that the buyer does not have to suffer a loss as a result of a credit event in order to qualify for the payment from the seller For example A buys from B the right to receive from B a payment of m in case company X is subject to bankruptcy proceedings or does not repay loan Y If company X undergoes bankruptcy proceedings or loan Y is not repaid a credit event occurs The occurrence of one of these events in circumstances involving the satisfaction of any other condition to payment that the parties may have specified in the transaction would give A the right to receive from B the agreed payment irrespective of whether A had any credit exposure to company X or loan Y This feature is of crucial importance to the determination of the regulatory environment applicable to credit derivatives In the UK if entering into credit derivatives transactions constituted the carrying on of insurance business there would be a requirement for authorisation under the Insurance Companies Act The fact that a buyer of a credit derivative does not have to hold the obligations in question in order to obtain a payment from the seller means that the credit derivative does not fall within the scope of this legislation This analysis was set out in full in a legal opinion obtained by ISDA in Reference entity It is essential that the reference entity is identified with sufficient precision For example to what extent are successors or affiliates of an entity to be included This point is particularly important when dealing with a sovereignWhat if any governmental agencies or authorities should be included within this definition The demerger of National Power last year led to further debate surrounding the definition of successor National Power shifted a large number of obligations to a new company called Innogy Following the demerger Innogy became a stronger credit than National Power had been beforehand and National Power in its new guise became weaker As a consequence buyers and sellers of credit protection in relation to National Power had opposing views from a commercial perspective at least as to which was the successor ISDA is now looking into further refinements to the concept of successor Credit events The buyer and seller may buy and sell credit risk defined by reference to different types of credit events It is appropriate that both select carefully the type of event on which they wish to trade The definitions offer a menu that comprises failure to pay acceleration or default repudiationmoratorium restructuring in each case in respect of one of the obligations identified in the confirmation and the bankruptcy of the reference entity In the case of all but the last of these the parties can choose to implement a type of materiality threshold by agreeing a payment requirement or default requirement that has to be crossed before the credit event is deemed to have occurred The parties may consider the definitions menu to be in need of amendment or supplement in order to deal with the specific credit risk they wish to trade For example the bankruptcy credit event focuses on events that corporate obligors could experience and would require tailoring if the Reference Entity were to take some other legal form The definition of restructuring was one of the most controversial provisions in the drafting process that led to the definitions In the forerunner of the definitions ISDAs long form of confirmation restructuring was defined by reference to events that had the effect of making the terms of the relevant obligation materially less favourable from an economic credit or risk perspective This definition was generally considered to be too subjective and had given rise to a number of disputes The new definition now refers to more objective criteria such as a reduction in the amount of principal or premium A degree of subjectivity is however retained in that events that would otherwise fall within the definition of restructuring do not constitute a restructuring if they do not result directly or indirectly from deterioration in the creditworthiness or financial condition of the reference entity However the markets disquiet regarding restructuring was not quelled by these changes and this recently gave rise to ISDA publishing a Restructuring Supplement The supplement restricts the types of obligation to which restructuring can apply It clarifies issues that the definitions were not clear on and places certain additional parameters on the ways in which a transaction can settle following a restructuring credit event Obligations Apart from the bankruptcy of the reference entity the question of whether a credit event has occurred is determined by reference to obligations identified in the confirmation The definitions introduce a matrix system based on the choice of one obligation category and if appropriate one or more obligation characteristics The aim of this structure is to introduce flexibility into the documentation process The obligation categories are payment borrowed money reference obligations only bond loan or bond or loan It is possible to give a very wide definition of obligations by selecting payment any obligation for the payment or repayment of money On the other hand it is possible to specify that credit events are only relevant if they occur with reference to only one obligation the reference obligation Choosing one or more obligation characteristics has the effect of restricting the field of obligations in relation to which a credit event may occur because an event will be relevant only if it occurs in relation to obligations of the chosen category and which have the chosen characteristics Examples of obligation characteristics are specified currency not domestic currency not domestic law Conditions to payment The fact that a credit event has occurred is not sufficient to trigger the payment of credit protection Before that can occur certain conditions to payment must be satisfied The definitions set out three conditions involving the service of notice A credit event notice must be served in any transaction before the credit protection will become payable The parties may choose that a notice of publicly available information must be served to cite news sources that confirm the occurrence of a credit event Finally if the transaction is to settle physically a notice of intended physical settlement must be served by the buyer Term of a transaction A credit event notice must refer to a credit event that occurs during the term of the transaction The term begins on the effective date and ends on the scheduled termination date both of which are agreed by the parties in the confirmation However where the credit event is a failure to pay the credit event must be continuing at the end of any applicable grace period or three days whichever is the longer This requirement is intended to avoid a credit event being triggered by a technical default but it means that a default could have occurred on or before the scheduled termination date even though the grace period is still pending at that time The definitions provide that the parties have two options in these circumstances They may either postpone the end of the term of the transaction beyond the scheduled termination date to the end of the grace period at which point if the failure to pay is continuing a credit event notice may be served Alternatively they may agree that the grace period must have expired before the scheduled termination date or no credit event notice may be served The latter is the fallback provision which applies unless the parties agree otherwise Physical and cash settlement The parties agree at the outset whether cash settlement or physical settlement applies to the relevant credit derivative transaction These are different means of realising the protection bought by the buyer where a credit event actually occurs If cash settlement applies the payment to be made by the seller to the buyer may be an amount fixed in advance or more usually an amount to reflect the drop in value of the reference obligation as determined by way of a dealers poll In the case of a physical settlement the buyer will deliver to the seller certain types of obligations deliverable obligations against payment of a fixed amount usually the face value of those obligations The buyer realises its protection because it delivers to the seller assets that are worth less than their face value but obtains payment of full face value from the seller Physical settlement is widely used in the market because it avoids having to determine the exact market value of the relevant obligation and in circumstances where a credit event has occurred it may be difficult to assess the drop in value of the reference obligation for the purpose of cash settlement On the other hand some buyers may prefer cash settlement because if the buyer has selected physical settlement and is unable to obtain suitable deliverable obligations to deliver due to for instance a squeeze of liquidity in the market the buyer may lose some or all of the protection it had under the credit derivative Deliverable obligations Deliverable obligations are defined as is the case for obligations by choosing one deliverable obligation category and any relevant deliverable obligation characteristic Although they are defined in the same way obligations and deliverable obligations play different roles Whereas obligations are what the parties refer to in order to assess whether a credit event has occurred other than in the case of bankruptcy deliverable obligations come into play only as a settlement tool and if the parties have specified that physical settlement applies The two do not need to be the same Future developments ISDA is working on producing dispute resolution guidelines It is also preparing a users guide to the definitions A goal in the future is to expand the definitions to govern more types of credit derivatives Assembling market consensus support for such developments has proved tricky As a result ISDA has recently introduced a new approach to the compilation of standard documents involving the inauguration of a small working party to make recommendations to the rest of the market This working party nicknamed the G is formed of institutions representing constituencies on both sides of the Atlantic and different parts of the market The agenda it has set itself includes review of other parts of the definitions including the bankruptcy repudiationmoratorium acceleration and default credit events language for zero coupon bonds and convertible bonds and a clarification of the successor definition with a view to producing further supplements or guidance as to what constitutes market standard on various issues Developments expected to be implemented in the coming months will show whether the C approach is more efficient than the previous collegiate approachThe credit derivatives market will continue to mature and expand These developments will mean that refining the definitions is a continuing process that will inspire fierce debate The Direction for Derivatives FOW October There are several ongoing have hindered the development of credit derivatives Lack of a single body to oversee disputes and concerns about risk exposure transparency have all added to a reluctance by some financial services organisations to use them As a result the development of underlying technology supporting credit derivatives has progressed more slowly than in other banking industry areas But this looks likely to change One of the major reasons for this is that the use of credit derivatives is beginning to climb According to the Bank of England the notional principal outstanding exceeds trillion globally And the British Bankers Association says the credit derivatives market has grown from an estimated billion outstanding notional value in to an estimated bn at the end of This increase is being driven by various developments in the banking industry not least the push for transparency Other key factors include the need for banks to Diversify their risk portfolio which is particularly important in a recession or slowdown to limit exposure to individual market sectors Achieve straight throughprocessing STP to improve efficiency and cost savings Demonstrate to regulators that they meet capital adequacy requirements Ensure an integrated single view of investment and risk As our current economic situation worsens exposure to credit risk grows and the use of financial instruments such as credit derivatives is increasing This has coincided with growing pressure in recent years for financial institutions to automate and integrate all their applications and processes to meet regulatory requirements minimise risk and keep pace with technological innovation Recent market developments Although not widely used the advent of online credit derivatives trading exchanges such as Creditexcom CreditTradecom and CreditDimensionscom is a significant indication that the market is growing The exchanges are backed by major players Creditex founded in April for example has equity investment and support from Deutsche Bank JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America among others while CreditDimensions eclectic mix includes Algorithmics Bureau van Dijk Electronic Publishing and Standard and Poors Prebon Yamane and Internet Capital Group are among the supporters of CreditTradecom And a new entrant Eprimuscom is expected to join the fray later this year intending to act as a creator and investor by selling credit protection in the form of default swaps on more than investmentgrade names These online exchanges also highlight the need for integrated systems particularly as banks are notorious for the number and diversity of platforms and applications used Integration interlude In the past financial organisations have relied on spreadsheets to record credit derivatives transactions And for most this is still the case Yet as STP and risk management become even higher on the agenda so too does the push for technologies that can effectively automate and manage transactions Banks must ensure that all processes are fully integrated and that back and middle offices can keep pace with front offices However given the plethora of proprietary trading platforms used by banks offerings must be easily designed built and integrated into core systems to be a worthwhile investment Electronic initiation execution and settlement is essential It is therefore crucial that any credit derivatives solution is Open Scalable Stable Flexible Easy to integrate Futureproof Software today So whats on the market so far Some vendors are pushing endtoend solutions while others are focusing on packaged componentbased solutions which can be bolted on to core systems And other vendors say their solutions can be bought as a standalone module or as part of a suite Leading players so far include Front Capital Murex Summit SunGard and Savvysoft The US companies appear to be benefiting from first mover advantage in the UK marketplace at this stage Current suppliers tend to be global organisations with an HQ in New York One exception is Front Capital Systems which has an office in London as well as in New York Stockholm Frankfurt Zurich and Johannesburg Many of the vendors are pushing fronttobackoffice solutions covering cash and derivatives trading as well as foreign exchange energy and commodities equities and interest rates Front Arena from Front Capital Systems for example combines fixed income asset swap and interest rate derivative capabilities with credit derivative functionality With high yielding securities and credit derivatives in the same system monitoring all positions simultaneously becomes easier Some vendors such as Murex offer a suite of integrated front and back office systems sharing the same middle and back office platform The solution offers integrated fronttoback office software solutions for cash and derivatives trading and processing in fx energy and commodities equities and interest rates This includes listed overthe counter OTC and exotics derivatives on securities and fx Summits credit derivatives module can be run as a standalone application or as part of a product suite and supported instruments include credit swaps credit linked bonds risky bonds theoretical valuation and forward bonds purchase binding and nonbinding Features include default probabilities and recovery rates Vendors including SunGard and Savvysoft have created componentbased offerings SunGards Credit Derivatives Components module provides a buildingblock asset allowing any possible credit derivative product to be structured and managed in a portfolio The module aims to offer staff the ability to structure price analyse trade and risk manage a variety of credit derivative instruments It supports several credit derivative instruments including credit default swaps credit spread options and total rate of return swaps The functionality includes the ability to Touch Payreceive par amount at the time a credit event occurs End Payreceive par amount at the end of the contracts life if a credit event occurs Annuity Payreceive a fee from the time a credit event occurs until the maturity of the contract Fee Payreceive a fee from the start of the contract until the first of either a credit event occurring or contract maturity And risk management is not forgotten The solution emphasises the importance of analytical integrity and the ability to support enterprisewide risk management It includes risk measures for credit derivatives commensurate with other interestrate sensitive instruments such as bonds caps and swaps This means that risk can therefore be aggregated across asset classes andor on a portfolio or enterprisewide level There is also an option to produce specific credit derivatives reports Savvysofts TOPS suite of products comprises nearly OTC and exchangetraded derivatives models Savvysofts newest product TOPS Credit is geared to handling many types of credit derivatives including total rate of return swaps credit default swaps credit linked notes credit spread options and others Like Summit Savvysoft takes default probabilities into account In addition to letting the user specify the probability of an issuer default TOPS Credit can also base its calculations on the probability of counterparty default and the correlation between these two probabilities The probabilities include functions of time interest rate levels and stock price levels to give users control over credit derivatives valuations Huge opportunity The credit risk transfer market has the potential to increase the overall robustness of the global financial system over time But to do this it is essential that financial institutions can rely on a stable scalable flexible solution that can be easily managed and integrated into core systems The growing popularity of credit derivatives will offer IT vendors an opportunity to extend their reach within financial institutions But we are currently at the early stages The credit derivatives instrument is still in development and the market is wide open for technology vendors particularly UK based suppliers to enter This is an emerging market and we have a long way to go before we know who will be the leader in this space and how it will develop End of ISDA Press Report for October THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF ISDAS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SPECIFIED CONSULTANTS TO ISDA

delivery IFR TRADING PRACTICE Investment banks offer derivatives services to clients Financial Times WEATHER DERIVATIVES Every cloud FOW ISDA clears way for Railtrack convertible delivery IFR October A UK lawyer retained by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association last Thursday advised that convertible bonds in their normal form meet the notcontingent clause of ISDAs standard credit derivatives definitions This cleared the way for banks to accept delivery of Railtracks m convertible under existing default swaps Around m of convertibles had been delivered under default swap exercises by the close of trading on Friday Although banks and other protection sellers will now realise some losses on acceptance of the Railtrack convertible compared with accepting Railtracks straight debt the advice from Robin Potts QC was welcomed by the heads of credit derivatives at the major dealers The legal opinion in effect removes one of the last main uncertainties about the enforceability of default swaps and should allow increased sales of credit derivatives to convertible bond buyers The market has demonstrated its maturity said the head of credit derivatives trading at one bank All the major houses are now accepting convertibles as deliverables A Londonbased lawyer was chosen to provide the advice because the UK is the regime with the main legal question marks about deliverability of convertible bonds under default swap contracts as well as the home of Railtrack European convertibles typically feature a trustee with the responsibility to exercise conversion rights if a stock price moves a certain way beyond the strike price on a convertible bond Banks had worried that this widows and orphans feature of convertible bonds could be interpreted to mean that the holder of a bond did not have full rights over its disposal and that the deal would not therefore be deliverable under standard default swap language The finding that convertibles are not contingent whether they have a trustee or not and therefore are deliverable under default swaps unless specified otherwise brought the price of the convertible bond closer to that of the cheapest to deliver of Railtracks straight bonds its Sm issue The convertible had been trading as low as early last week while the bond had been trading around By the close of trading on Friday however the convertible was priced at bid only while the bond was at Assuming that default swap exercises were around these levels the total cost to protection sellers of the Potts opinion would have been roughly m when comparing the cost of accepting m of the convertible with delivery of the straight bond This cost will rise slightly as the gap between the prices of the convertible and the straight issue is likely to narrow further before more exercises are completed Bank derivatives heads generally view the shortterm cost as negligible compared with the benefit of some assurance that convertibles are deliverable The advice from Potts does not carry the same weight as a court judgement but as the price of the convertible has appreciated there is little chance that an end investor in a synthetic securitisation or creditlinked note will mount a legal challenge to try to stop a bank from accepting delivery of the convertible The banks that arrange these structured trades normally have the responsibility for handling any default swap exercises on the credits included ISDA will soon unveil new detailed guidance on credit derivatives written on convertible debt including the zerocoupon bonds that have been a major feature of issuance this year Investment banks offer derivatives services to clients Financial Times October By John Labate JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are the latest firms to offer new derivatives services to their clients The two investment banks are expected to announce the first licensing agreements today with Longitude a Manhattanbased online derivatives platform that will also launch today The agreements give both firms exclusive licenses to offer derivatives trading in a unique series of products Derivative services allow companies and other institutions to offset the risks that are inherent in a number of their investments or commercial activities Traditionally the risks that have been hedged have been limited to things traded already such as stocks bonds or currencies Longitude was founded in and offers a service to run auctionbased hedging services for events of economic significance that cannot be hedged currently in the derivatives markets according to chief executive Andrew Lawrence Mr Lawrence a former hedge fund executive says in its initial phase the company will offer JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank clients derivatives and risk management services for economic statistics In the near term other derivatives services will be launched through Longitude to hedge the weather equity prices mortgage payments data central bank target rates and to cover other areas JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank did not state the amounts of their spending for their licenses or the length of those contracts with Longitude This differentiates us as a provider of cuttingedge derivatives products said Chris Harvey managing director at JP Morgan There is no direct mechanism in the capital markets for clients to take views or hedge exposure to underlying economic variables Longitudes founders designed the system to simulate auction systems where prices were set without the need to match buyers and sellers in the market The system is similar to betting that occurs at horse tracks where the prices are based on all bets Once the hedged event occurs the many separate claims are paid from the hedges placed in the system Every cloud FOW October It would have been tempting in to believe that the art of financial risk management had reached a zenith That was the year innovative energy companies demonstrated that derivatives could be used to hedge the financial impact of one of the most powerful and unpredictable variables confronting business managers Mother Nature According to the US Department of Commerce at least trillion of the US economy is sensitive to the vagaries of the weather including vast portions of the energy manufacturing retailing tourism and agriculture industries Yet it was only with the development of weather derivatives that companies gained the ability to protect their financial results from significant but noncatastrophic weather events such as excessive heat precipitation or wind risks that few traditional insurance policies could efficiently cover Today it is clear that the trading of the worlds first weather derivative a temperature collar executed between Koch Industries and Enron marked the dawn of a new era in risk management not the crowning of an old one It signaled the creation of a trading market fundamentally more efficient than insurance which after all requires insurers to retain their clients risk and to charge a risk premium for providing that service A trading market by contrast matches principals on either side of a risk eliminating the need for a risk premium The result is a less costly more efficient means of risk transfer Not surprisingly companies whose financial results are sensitive to the weather have been flocking to this new market The cumulative notional value of all weather derivatives executed since exceeds billion Meanwhile leadingedge traders are continuing to develop a seemingly endless stream of new products that give companies the opportunity to hedge all sorts of risks once considered unmanageable from advertising costs to river flows However it is obvious that this new market still confronts numerous challenges Whole industries need to be educated in the use and value of derivatives Governments in the US and abroad must be shown that marketoriented solutions to risk management can be more effective and more efficient for consumers than regulatory solutions Some US regulators still allow utilities to recoup the cost of bad weather from their ratepayers through inefficient weather normalisation clauses for example In some regions of the world and some market niches data for indices that underlie these new products must become more rigorously standardised and more widely available Despite these challenges the opportunities are nearly limitless The past halfdecade has shown that nearly any highvolume product service or business variable that can be measured can be commoditised and that anything that can be commoditised can be traded Enron began proving this idea in when deregulation of the natural gas industry was forcing companies to change the way they contracted for gas in the wholesale market That year Enron executed the worlds first naturalgas swap to meet the needs of a customer that wanted to lock in a fixed price for its gas purchases To make the deal work Enron agreed to absorb the cost or benefit of monthly spot gas purchases tied to a published index Five years after creating what would become the precursor to todays wholesale gas trading business Enron began migrating its gas trading expertise into other markets beginning with electrical power In it completed the worlds first weather trade Two years later the companys newly formed Enron Broadband Services unit debuted its Enron Intelligent Network an Internet application delivery platform that later led to Enrons first bandwidth trade That year also marked the launch of EnronOnline There companies can buy and sell a vast array of physical commodities and related derivatives contracts in markets as diverse as natural gas power emission allowances bandwidth weather derivatives NGLs petrochemicals and plastics coal crude oil pulp and paper credit derivatives shipping steel and metals However the idea of hedging risk with derivatives is not a new one As early as the th century vendors at European trade fairs were signing contracts for future delivery of goods Futures contracts were part of tulip mania in Holland in the early s In that same century the Japanese created a futures market in rice at Dojima near Osaka to protect sellers from bad weather or warfare In the Chicago Board of Trade began trading wheat pork belly and copper futures Today the range of commodities and risks that can be traded are limited only by imagination and determination The weather market A closer look at the development of the weather market illustrates the opportunity According to a survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Weather Risk Management Association the number of weather contracts executed in the months ended April rose by to from the comparable yearearlier period While the total notional value of weather derivatives traded during that time declined to billion the downturn appears to have been a consequence of happenstance in this case mild temperatures during the winters of and in North America where more than of all contracts were executed Those temperate winters the survey managers theorise likely caused buyers of temperaturerelated weather derivatives to demand less protection against the possibility of an unusually cold winter in While temperaturerelated weather contracts remain for the moment the most popular type of weather derivative there are signs that the market is broadening While temperaturelinked contracts accounted for of all contracts traded during the first three andahalf years of the markets development for example contracts linked to other measures accounted for of all contracts written during the six months ended April We can expect this broadening of the market to continue as new products give companies the power to more precisely hedge their risks Prime examples introduced recently include power demand swaps and crosscommodity options Demand swaps are designed to overcome one of the biggest pitfalls of weather derivatives they can protect companies against swings in demand either for the products they sell or the raw materials they consume only to the extent that demand is impacted by the weather Demand swaps by contrast protect companies from fluctuations in demand regardless of the cause making them a more flexible and in some cases more accurate hedging tool Power demand swaps allow companies that buy and sell electricity to lockin their demand or consumption exposure within a specified power pool in the US Suppose for example that a power aggregator serving customers in the PJM PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland pool routinely buys its power in the forward market When demand exceeds the norm the aggregator is forced to purchase additional power in the open market generally at inflated prices With demand swaps the aggregator can receive payments from Enron when weekly demand within its pool exceeds the average In exchange it would agree to make payments to Enron when weekly demand is below average When it is required to make payouts it can offset their cost in part by selling some of its excess power back into the market For utilities uncomfortable with the openended cost of a swap Enron also offers power demand options that limit costs to the premium paid for the option Crosscommodity options protect companies against both price and volume volatility simultaneously Unlike a traditional weather derivative which pays out a specified amount of cash per unit of weather these new contracts pay out based on the difference between the market price of an underlying commodity such as energy and a contracted strike price for that commodity The payout is still triggered however by a weather variable Heres a reallife example In July a Midwestern utility began searching for protection against the adverse financial impact of a warmer than normal winter Per its custom the utility wished to purchase its gas for the upcoming winter in advance via the futures market and to lock in a sufficient quantity to cover the coldest possible winter The downside of this strategy is that if the winter proves unseasonable mild the utility would be left with a long gas position in a soft market Not only would the utility sell less gas to its customers than anticipated it would probably have to sell gas back into the spot market at deflated prices Under the terms of a crosscommodity contract the utility entered into with Enron it will receive compensation if the number of heating degree days the cumulative number of degrees below F from November through March is below a predetermined strike The amount of compensation is dependent upon the market price of gas at the beginning of each month covered by the contract Enron through what are effectively put options settled in cash will pay the utility the difference between the market price of gas that month and a strike price equal to what the utility paid in the futures market Growing global While most weather derivatives have been traded in the US they have already begun to migrate overseas into Oslo Tokyo Sydney and London Other important players are entering the market too They include most notably large financial institutions Goldman Sachs in the US Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank in Germany and Credit Lyonnais in France The importance of their participation in this new market rests to a large degree on the relationships they have with their clients relationships founded in part on trust Because of that trust companies already doing business with these banks may be more receptive to entering what is for most of them a novel marketplace In addition these banks can offer their clients incentives to use weather derivatives in the form of reduced lending rates a reward reflecting the fact that users of weather derivatives generally enjoy smoother more predictable financial results than their competitors who do not use them A final factor driving the growth of the weather derivatives market is the increasing pressure companies are getting from lenders and investors to make use of these instruments Now that companies can control the financial impact of adverse weather conditions they are finding it increasingly hard to justify any failure to do so End of ISDA Press Report for October THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF

at Hearing Question Need For Hedging Regulations Standard BNA Towards one interest rate Business Standard Credit protection costs down after Fed cut Reuters Argentine bond swap seeks to calm fears of debt default Financial Times ISDA Unveils New Margin Accord For Collateral Process Dow Jones May By Joe Niedzielski NEW YORK Dow Jones The International Swaps and Derivatives Association said Wednesday that it has published new documentation on margin provisions The document known as the ISDA margin provisions updates and simplifies ISDAS four existing credit support documents in a single document ISDA said Wednesday in a press release The document is easy to understand and will reduce the barriers to entry for new derivatives market participants Robert Pickel ISDAs executive director and CEO said in the release In many areas of the overthecounter derivatives market financial institutions and other end users of derivatives such as corporations and fund managers reduce credit exposure by posting cash collateral But unlike the highlyliquid and standardized US government securities repurchase market where the transfer of collateral is generally initiated by the close of business following a morning margin call a derivatives counterparty may have to wait as long as days to two weeks before being able to liquidate ISDAs new document though includes steppedup timing standards for collateral calls The provisions have common operational provisions incorporate a plain English approach and offer more streamlined timing and disputeresolution procedures ISDA said Parties using the provisions can select jurisdictionspecific provisions to apply to their margin arrangements under New York English and Japanese law ISDA said The ISDA margin provisions documentation project was partially a response to bouts of market turmoil in recent years Several disputes have arisen between market participants in the wake of s liquidity seizure and flighttoquality following Russias debt default and the near demise of Long Term Capital Management the heavilyleveraged hedge fund The provisions were a response to market disruptions in recent years and offer a mechanism to reduce credit exposure arising between the time of a trade and the time at which an institution can liquidate any available collateral said David Maloy managing director of global collateral and margin at UBS Warburg and a cochair of the ISDA collateral committee For institutions that want to amend their existing credit support annexes rather than opt for the new margin provisions amendment forms to the New York law and English law credit support annexes will be available in June ISDA said ISDA said those forms will mirror the operative sections of the provisions with respect to transfer timing dispute resolution and substitutions or exchange of margin IRS Officials at Hearing Question Need For Hedging Regulations Standard BNA May By Alison Bennett Internal Revenue Service and Treasury officials May sharply questioned witnesses on why they should broaden the risk standard used to define hedging transactions in proposed rules REG that have drawn criticism from the practitioner community Nearly every hearing witness said the proposed rules do not go far enough in implementing a new standard for hedging enacted under the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of Pub L No That law changed the standard for qualifying hedging transactions from one focusing on risk reduction transactions to one centered around risk management transactions Witnesses complained that the proposed rules DTR G L retained too great a focus on risk reduction as a way to assess whether favorable hedging treatment should be allowed The rules represent a serious and inappropriate failure to live up to congressional standards said Andrea Kramer of McDermott Will Emery in Chicago I find it inconceivable that anybody could argue that the tax act did not result in a farreaching and substantive change to the meaning of hedging transactions Kramer said Questions From IRS She was questioned closely by JoLynn Ricks an IRS attorneyadviser on financial institutions and products about why the government should broaden the standard to go beyond the position taken by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on hedging in which focused on risk reduction Kramer contended that Financial Accounting Standard No which was amended last June DTR G is not relevant to tax questions surrounding the hedging of derivatives The financial accounting rules for derivatives and hedging transactions are fundamentally different from the tax rules Kramer said I would argue that FAS is not significant here In addition to urging the government to replace all mention of risk reduction in the final rules with the standard of risk management both Kramer and Earl Goldhammer of American Electric Power asked for favorable treatment for certain transactions by commodities dealers Commodities Proposal Under the proposal raised by both witnesses qualifying transactions would relate to a derivative valued in reference to a commodity also handled by the dealer fall within preapproved controls on speculation set out in formally adopted risk management policies and not be identified by the commodities dealer as having been entered into in its dealer capacity We would like to know that if a trader trades within preapproved limits and if you have a risk management program that is not a phony program that that is legitimate Goldhammer said Although Goldhammer was identified on an IRS hearing document as working for Americas Energy Partners DTR G TaxCore he told IRS officials that is merely his companys slogan Salomon Smith Barney Tax Director Mark Perwien representing the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc in New York also criticized the references to risk reduction found under the proposed rules Its very important for a company to be able to manage its price and all of its other risks in a way that is consistent with how it sees the marketplace Perwien told the government panel The ISDA representative acknowledged that obviously IRS is concerned about being whipsawed but said protections such as sameday identification of derivatives already exist He stressed that to properly implement congressional intent the final rules should apply to all transactions undertaken in the ordinary course of business that alter the taxpayers exposure to one or more of the risks inherent in the taxpayers core economic activities In addition he said favorable hedging treatment should be available for weather and energy supply derivatives IRS also should permit hedges of dividend streams overall profitability and other business risks that do not relate directly to interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations Periwen told the government Gap Hedges Raised Testifying on behalf of the American Council of Life Insurers Washington DC Frank Gould of Prudential Life Insurance Co urged IRS and Treasury to provide favorable treatment of gap hedging of derivatives by his industry IRS field agents are routinely concluding that gap hedges are not good tax hedgestheyre consistently saying theyre hedges of capital assets Gould said Gap hedging isnt about a particular asset or group of assets he said Its about maintaining balance between assets and liabilities Its an integral part of how we run our business Peter Carlisle of Baker McKenzie Washington DC and his colleague Jeff Wallace both said the IRS definition of risk management is inappropriately restrictive Wallace said that because companies approach hedging in different ways it would be appropriate for IRS to be more flexible in what it considers qualifying risk management activities Split Approach to Hedging For example he said some companies take a macroeconomic approach to hedging in which the entire enterprise faces economic risk while others take a microeconomic or transactionbytransaction approach to these risks Enterprise risk reduction is a nebulous concept which is really not practicable for taxpayers who manage their risk on a microeconomic level Wallace said Ricks asked if IRS should consider an approach which would allow taxpayers to do both macroeconomic and microeconomic hedging as long as they identify which type they are doing and allow that to control treatment of the transaction Both Carlisle and Wallace said they would heartily endorse such an approach The government panel included two other officials from IRS financial institutions and products special counsel Richard Carlisle and branch chief Alvin Kraft Also on the panel were Viva Hammer a Treasury attorneyadviser and Robert Hanson Treasury deputy tax legislative counsel for regulatory affairs The transcript of the hearing will be in BNA TaxCore Towards one interest rate Business Standard May Janaki Krishnan The introduction of options and futures to replace the timetested badla system effective July will align interest rates in the money and equity markets leading to a more effective monetary transmission mechanism At a macro level the significance of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Sebi decision to ban badla and all deferral products and have only a cash and a derivatives market marks the integration of the equity and money markets This means the RBIs interest rate signals will be absorbed faster in the wider financial system Currently as Shekhar Sathe CEO of Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund says there are varying badla rates on each of the scrips eligible for carry forward It is like having interest rates in the system he says Badla rates are derived as the sum of an equity risk premium on that particular scrip over and above the interest rate component In effect since the equity risk component varies from week to week and differently in different scrips it masks the cost of money Thus badla for scrip X may be per cent but for scrip Y it may be only per cent The financial sector is sharply divided between the banking and the equities sector All this is set to change with the introduction of derivatives At a simplified level since operators can take a position on the spot and futures markets at the same time the cost of money is already factored into the derivative prices This reflects the opportunity cost of taking a forward position Thus an operator who buys in spot and short sells in the futures market is actually putting up cash now in return for future gains Since this involves a cash outlay the operator will at least expect his returns to cover the interest costs for the period of the contract Derivatives pricing thus incorporates the cost of money Says Sebi board member J R Varma The system will eventually lead to a convergence of interest rates throughout the system Market sources said though the extent of banks involvement in the revised trading systems will only be clarified later there were tremendous opportunities for banks to take proprietary positions in the derivative markets For instance banks could play a leading role in the developments of calendar spreads which are basically forwardtoforward contracts in the foreign exchange markets Thus a bank may buy a onemonth contract and sell a sixmonth contract Since the price of the latter will be more than that of the onemonth contract the bank will make a net spread But since the market rates of interest will smoothen out over all markets this spread will typically reflect the difference between onemonth and sixmonth money Arbitrage opportunities like this will lead to a uniformity of interest rates Varma said Money market dealers welcomed the move saying that equities as an asset class are a welcome addition to the limited deployment options before banks Acknowledging that not all banks will be comfortable with dealing in the equity derivatives markets one dealer says As long as one bank is comfortable arbitraging between the money and equity markets the rates will align as this bank can borrow in call and deploy the funds in derivative spreads If the call money rates are higher this bank can do a reverse arbitrage The second implication is that equity prices in the spot markets will respond quicker to interest rate changes Currently lower interest rates will to lower interest costs for companies in the coming years thereby boosting its net profits This reflects in optimism on the equity price front after interest rates are cut But with a derivatives market a rate cut will immediately impact derivative prices and arbitrageurs will ensure that this is immediately transmitted to spot equity prices too Much like in the US we are looking at a situation where money market rates will determine the valuations of a wide spectrum of asset classes and not just gilts the chief dealer of a private bank says This will lead to a much more responsive financial system he adds Credit protection costs down after Fed cut Reuters May By Tom Burroughes LONDON May Reuters The cost of credit protection declined across most sectors in the default swap market on Wednesday after the US Federal Reserves rate cut but prices on two firms debt rose due to planned new issuance dealers said Credit default swaps narrowed around two to three basis points for automakers and telecoms continuing a trend of recent weeks and further encouraged by the Feds basis point easing on Tuesday said a dealer for a European bank in London Default swaps are insurance type instruments which allow investors to adjust their exposure to the risk of default or other event on a bond or loan They compose the most liquid part of the present credit derivative market Spreads in the cash and default swap market are both two to three basis points tighter in general the dealer said In telecoms fiveyear default swaps on British Telecom were cited at about two basis points tighter Deutsche Telekom were two basis points in at and France Telecom slightly narrower at the dealer said In the car sector the dealer said protection on DaimlerChrysler has fallen about two basis points to Another trader at a European bank said French carmaker Peugeot traded at three bps down from the start of the week In banks activity was quiet but default swaps were a touch tighter Deutsche Bank senior debt was cited at a bidoffer spread of In industrials default swaps inched down on firms such as French glassmaker St Gobain which declined to a bidoffer spread of down around four basis points from Monday a dealer said DEFYING THE TREND Credit protection costs rose on a couple of firms to buck the general trend Fiveyear default swaps on the Swedish mobile phone company Ericsson rose basis points to from Tuesday when bankers announced the firm was to issue billion euros of fiveyear and million sterling of sevenyear bonds Another Scandanavian firm in play was the FinnishSwedish forest industry group Stora Enso which is to issue a dollardenominated global bond Fiveyear default swaps have widened about basis points to since the announcement last week said a dealer for a European bank MOSTLY ONE WAY Default swaps were grinding lower on most names in part because of synthetic credit portfolio deals which means players who are short credit risk are hedging their positions by selling default swaps The growth of the synthetic portfolio market has been pressing down credit protection prices recently A synthetic portfolio replicates portfolios of bonds by selling default swaps on various names To change this trend players may need to believe the interest rate outlook is changing or fresh debt supply is in the pipeline said one dealer for a European bank in London We need some issuance and a view that rates have bottomed out he said Argentine bond swap seeks to calm fears of debt default Financial Times May By Peter Hudson Thomas Catan David Mulford the US banker who has played a leading role in putting together Argentinas massive bond swap on Wednesday defended the deal saying it represented a new marketled approach to tackling sovereign debt crises The deal which seeks to exchange nearterm bonds for longer dated paper is seen as crucial to calming fears that Argentina could default on its bn debt Investors are anxiously awaiting terms of the transaction which Mr Mulford a former US Treasury undersecretary with connections to Domingo Cavallo Argentine economy minister said could be launched as early as next week Speaking in Buenos Aires on Wednesday Mr Mulford international chairman at Credit Suisse First Boston said the deal would be easily the largest of its kind and could resolve Argentinas financing problems without the need for additional aid from financial institutions The International Monetary Fund helped assemble a package of aid worth nearly bn in December Although he declined to discuss details of the swap citing Securities and Exchange Commission regulations Mr Mulford described it as essential to longterm success in restoring Argentine growth He added that the operation would imply a substantial reduction in debt payments over the next three to four years If the deal was a success he said its size will effectively change the Argentine debt market and market perception According to bankers the transaction could save Argentina bnbn in debt servicing costs before giving it time to resume growth and bring its debt burden under control Argentinas benchmark FRB bond surged l points on Wednesday after the Argentine president Fernando de la Rua signed a decree authorising the deal Argentina has been mired in recession for nearly three years raising doubts about its ability to keep servicing foreign debt That prospect has caused alarm because the country accounts for almost a quarter of tradeable emerging market debt Although the overall size of the debt is comparable to that of other emerging markets Mr Mulford said concerns about its shortterm structure meant that unless that is addressed it is doubtful world markets will really support growth in Argentina The countrys interest rates are at a very high level as a result of investor uncertainty But Mr Mulford rejected suggestions that Argentina should await lower rates before launching the deal Its essential to do this deal now he said End of ISDA Press

Journal Darwinism With Chinese Characteristics The Asian Wall Street Journal UK Building Societies To Use Derivatives For Credit Risk Dow Jones International News May LONDON Dow Jones The UK Treasury said Thursday that it is proposing legislation to allow building societies to use derivatives to protect themselves against credit risk Building societies are already allowed to use certain types of derivatives to protect themselves against interest rate risk currency risk and house price fluctuations But the treasury proposal agreed by the Building Societies Commission will allow the building societies to use derivatives to protect themselves against credit risks a treasury spokesman said Unlike banks which are allowed to use derivatives to protect themselves against credit risk building societies havent been allowed to do so so far because of a clause in the Building Societies Act The proposal will be put to parliament and is likely to be approved unless a member of parliament opposes it the spokesman said The BSC considers the credit derivatives market to be sufficiently developed to offer building societies broad and flexible protection Credit derivatives will initially be used only by societies which already have a sophisticated treasury management capability the treasury said Currency swap agreements strengthen Asian cooperation Financial Times May By Edward Luce Japan yesterday announced that it had concluded bilateral swap agreements with Thailand South Korea and Malaysia as part of the regions continued progress towards strengthened monetary cooperation The agreements which were reached on the first day of the annual conference of the Asian Development Bank in Honolulu come a year after the Asian member countries plus China Japan and South Korea pledged mutual central bank support at a meeting in Chiang Mai The swap arrangements were designed to provide the former victims of the Asian financial crisis with firepower to fight off any speculative attacks on their currencies Japan said it was also negotiating central bank swap agreements with the Philippines and China But Seichiro Murakami Japans deputy finance minister would not disclose the nature or the terms of the swaps agreements except to say they were not based on the defense of any preagreed exchange rate levels Most of the regions economies have adopted free floating or managed float currencies after speculative attacks obliterated their exchange rate pegs with the US dollar in The bilateral deals provide Korea with Dollars bn Pounds bn in possible currency support Dollars bn for Malaysia and Dollars bn for Thailand Tun Daim Zainuddin Malaysias finance minister said the agreement which comes in addition to the Dollars bn pledged in mutual swap support by Asian countries last November would help prepare the region for any eventualities We will not be caught by surprise this time said Mr Daim Our currencies are not at risk now In fact in most of the Asian countries our reserves have increased Mr Daim also pointed out that the Dollars bn in potential support for Malaysia came in addition to a further Dollars bn in currency support that had been pledged by Japan under the Miyazawa plan named after Japans former finance minister Unlike the Miyazawa pledge which comes free of broader conditions only per cent of the bilateral swap agreement can be drawn before triggering control by the International Monetary Fund Wednesdays announcements mark a weakening of Japans drive towards the creation of an Asian Monetary Fund vetoed by the US in the late s In contrast to Tokyos original goal of devolving more decisions to Asia Japan described the bilateral swap agreements as complementary to the broader financial framework supervised by the International Monetary Fund in Washington The Honolulu agreements which will be reviewed in three years form part of a broader drive by Asian countries to strengthen regional cooperation following the crisis Such efforts which span deeper trade liberalisation within Asian and greater political dialogue between Asian and its east Asian neighbours have been given further impetus by the damping effects of the US economic slowdown on the regions hightech export sector Paul ONeill US Treasury secretary told delegates at the opening ceremony of the ADB annual conference that in spite of the regions impressive recovery since Asian countries had to accelerate and deepen efforts to restructure their financial and corporate sectors Mr ONeill whose remarks were clearly directed at South Korea Thailand and Indonesia which are still struggling to resolve the overhang of bad debts from the crisis also urged Japan to take steps to boost aggregate global demand by confronting obstacles to the revival of domestic demand Greenspan Backs RiskBased Pricing Of Deposit Insurance Provided by FDIC BNA May CHICAGOFederal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan May called for more risksensitive pricing of deposit insurance provided to banks by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation saying recent FDIC proposals to move toward riskbased pricing are useful Greenspan spoke at during the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicagos th Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition Federal Reserve Board Governor Laurence H Meyer who spoke at the conference the same day said the system must be adapted to manage the challenges posed by new technologies new financial strategies and the globalization of the financial services industry Though Greenspan said federal regulation of the financial services industry has provided an admirable degree of stability to banks and investors he said these benefits come at a significant cost and reform is needed He called for financial industry supervisory policies that promote the type of market discipline that existed prior to the erection of current safety net structures which evolved in the wake of the Great Depression In addition he reminded large institutions engaged in risky practices and their investors that the safety net cannot and will not insulate them from every type of financial crisis Marketbased reforms would better protect investors reduce costs to the economy and allocate risk more equitably the Fed chairman said While valuing the benefits of stability that the safety net confers we nonetheless need to recognize that the benefits are not without costs Greenspan said In this context Greenspan added reform of the safety net must remain on the agenda I believe this means being very cautious about purposefully or inadvertently extending the scope and reach of the safety net It also means supervisory reform to create as best we can inducements to bank behavior similar to those that would exist with no safety net And it means I think that there be a presumption that uninsured claimants are at risk It appears politically infeasible to eliminate government subsidies of deposit insurance altogether but more risksensitive pricing is nonetheless helpful and prudential regulation has already begun to move in the right direction to reduce the safety net subsidy Greenspan said The socalled financial safety net as currently configured is comprised of banking regulation deposit insurance the Feds discount window and access to Fedwire and daylight overdrafts he said He said these structures provide depository institutions and market players with a degree of safety liquidity and solvency never before seen in economic history At the same time this structure comes at a cost to the economy Among other things Greenspan pointed to distortions in the price signals used to allocate resources inducements for institutions to take excessive risks and relatively high degrees of government supervision as a strategy for limiting moral hazard FDIC Proposal Useful To avoid these distortions Greenspan suggested reforms aimed at pricing and managing the safety net in a manner aimed at simulating what the markets alone might do Toward this end he called for fairer pricing mechanisms with respect to FDIC insurance premiums Greenspan did not discuss specific components of the recently released FDIC reform proposal but he described it as useful and commented that the plan moves the agency toward better pricing to safety net access On April the FDIC proposed a system under which all institutions would pay riskbased premiums based on indexed coverage levels and a merger of the bank and savings association insurance funds DER A The House Financial Services Committee will broach the controversial subject of how best to reform the deposit insurance system in a hearing scheduled for May Greenspan also called for regulatory structures aimed at making capital requirements sensitive to each banks particular risk profile and exposure He said supervision and examination policies are moving in this direction and are evident in the new Basel Capital Accord Finally Greenspan called for greater market disciplinea factor that preserved the banking system prior to the development of the safety net The real presafetynet discipline was from the market and we need to adopt policies that promote private counterparty supervision as the first line of defense for a safe and sound banking system he said Disclosure Key Greenspan Says To promote this concept Greenspan called for wider disclosure by financial institutions so counterparties can better evaluate risk While banks are already subjected to significant degrees of disclosure Greenspan said the quantity and quality of the data is often uneven He suggested that all entities could should and may soon be required to disclose more and better data But Greenspan stressed that market discipline will never be achieved unless uninsured private counterparties understand that they will not be protected by the safety net He suggested too many players live under the false assumption that they will always be made whole under a de facto toobigtofail policy Let me remind you that the ten largest US banking organizations fund only about onefourth of their worldwide banking assets with insured deposits Greenspan said Let me also remind you that the leastcost resolution exception contained in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act does not require that all uninsured creditors be made whole but rather only that they be made no worse off than they would have been if the bank were liquidated The potential for greater market discipline at large institutions is substantial Greenspan said he could conceive of rare situations when the FDIC or other governmental resources would temporarily be used to sustain failing institutions pending managed liquidation but that indefinitely propping up insolvent intermediaries is the road to stagnation and substantial resource misallocation as recent history attests Meyer Seconds Reform Call Meyer in his speech also argued for a more riskbased regulatory structure Meyer acknowledged the FDICs April proposal for reform but would not comment on it Meyer complimented the agency on its diligence but said the board would withhold judgment on the plan until it has had a chance to fully review it There seems to be a widespread feeling which I share that additional or at least improved efforts toward limiting moral hazard enhancing market discipline and lowering taxpayer liabilities should and can be made Meyer said Our world is a rapidly changing place with technological change financial engineering globalization and deregulation combining to alter the realities we all face As a result all of us must be willing to adapt old policies and adopt new one if the circumstances require Meyer noted that unfortunately existing riskbased capital standards are becoming divorced from the realities of modern risk management for a growing number of financial institutions As such he said the Basel Accords capital ratios have become a less reliable tool for determining the capital strength of a particular firm Meyer said the new Basel Capital Accord creates standards that will reflect the true risks being taken by the most financially sophisticated and complex banks He called on bankers to provide public comments on the proposal to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision by the end of May It is of the highest priority that for the most financially sophisticated and complex banks we make the capital standards more reflective of the risks that they are in fact taking Meyer said FDICs Murton Speaks Arthur J Murton director of the FDICs division of insurance also spoke at the conference He said that in developing the reform plan the FDIC hoped to make significant improvements in the safety net while acknowledging political realities We hoped it would represent an intersection of sound economic and financial principles on the one hand and political realities on the other Murton said during the same panel discussion with Meyer Our goal was to offer a framework that with further discussion and modification could generate a consensus around these issues and could make its way through the legislative process We might have come up with a different approach if we had started from scratch Instead we recognized that passing banking legislation without a banking crisis requires consensus Murton said the plan calls for a merger of the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund and the elimination of current restrictions on charging riskbased premiums In addition the plan calls for indexation of insurance coverage levels to reflect inflationary changes and a shift from the current percent Designated Reserve Ratio to a target level between certain ranges The plan also suggests the development for the first time of a rebate system when certain triggers are achieved SEC CFTC Propose Joint Rules For Trading of New Security Futures BNA May The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission announced May that they have proposed joint rules to implement new statutory provisions relating to security futures products Security futures are single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indicesgiven new life by last years sweeping Commodity Exchange Act reform legislation after a nearly year ban In related matters the SEC May proposed rules and a new registration form for designated contract markets and derivative transaction execution facilities to use to register as national securities exchanges to trade the new instruments Release No Joint Regulation Under the law security futures are securities under the federal securities laws but may be traded on either futures or securities exchanges The CFMA also established a framework for the joint regulation of security futures products by the CFTC and SEC the agencies noted However they added futures contracts on broadbased indexes remain under the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC Accordingly the SEC and CFTC related they proposed joint rules regarding the distinction between broadbased and narrowbased security indexes According to the regulators the CFMA defines the criteria for an index to be considered narrowbased including among other factors the market capitalization of each security in the index and the dollar value of that securitys average daily trading volume The statute also requires the two agencies jointly to specify the methods that must be used to determine these values In their release the SEC and CFTC said the proposed rules are designed to fulfill that statutory mandate as well as to address other issues that arise in the application of the definition of narrowbased security index They noted that trading in security futures products may begin Aug provided certain regulatory requirements are met After considering any comments the agencies said they expect to adopt final rules prior to Aug New Rules to Improve Competitiveness Of European Markets Commissioner Says BNA May Key legislation needed to make European financial markets more competitive with US markets is expected to be introduced by early Frits Bolkestein a Dutch member of the person European Commission said May In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute Bolkestein reaffirmed the European Unions commitment to requiring all EUbased companies to use the International Accounting Standards IAS practices in their record keeping in order to enhance transparency and provide higher quality financial information to investors across the world The use of one global accounting language will greatly benefit European companies It will help them compete on equal terms for global capital Bolkestein said He added that the legislation would require companies to begin preparing their consolidated accounts using IAS by Bolkestein also said he is hopeful that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will begin to accept financial statements prepared by firms in the European Union without requiring them to be reconciled with the generally accepted accounting principles GAAP standard used in the United States A major reason that changes are needed in the European Unions financial regulations is because of the unprecedented volume of mergers and acquisitions between American and European firms Another reason is that the European Union has established a goal of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledgebased economy in the world capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion Bolkestein said Since Bolkestein said the European community has added jobs and has seen improved competition and productivity add percent to gross domestic product growth because of measures taken to create a single market for financial services If the European Union is successful at restructuring its financial system by Bolkestein said he sees other benefits to include a lower cost of capital for all companies a deeper and more vibrant venture capital market lower costs of purchasing financial products and higher returns on pensions and investment funds To realize those benefits Bolkestein said the European Commission would like to see an integrated securities market in place by replacing the individual domestic securities markets of the European Unions member states Mergers and alliances between existing exchanges are already breaking down barriers pooling liquidity reducing clearing costs decreasing volatility and increasing transparency Bolkestein said He added that Europe is also seeing a marked increase in the number of online brokerage accounts which further contributes to efficiency and transparency but also creates a greater need for changes in the way the European Union regulates its financial sector Top securities lawyer set to head SEC Financial Times May By John Labate President George W Bush yesterday named securities lawyer Harvey L Pitt to head the US Securities and Exchange Commission after one of the administrations longest searches yet to fill a key post If approved by the Senate Mr Pitt would replace Arthur Levitt who stepped down as chairman in February after more than eight years Mr Bush is expected to send a formal nomination to the senate soon but no date for a confirmation hearing has been set Mr Pitt a partner at New Yorkbased law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver Jacobson is widely regarded as one of the countrys leading experts on securities law and one of its toughest litigators His long list of clients has included Ivan Boesky for whom in he negotiated a m settlement with SEC officials on insider trading charges Other clients include LLoyds of London the New York Stock Exchange and all big five accounting firms The move would return Mr Pitt to the SEC where he worked for a decade after law school and where at age he served as its youngest ever general counsel He has remained at Fried Frank Harris since leaving the SEC in The planned nomination comes as the SEC faces a number of difficult issues including decisions on the structure of securities trading as more markets inside and outside the US seek to become publicly traded companies Were heading into a period of globalisation that will call for change said Richard Phillips former SEC assistant general counsel and partner at the law firm Kirkpatrick Lockhart It wont be for congress to take the lead but a chairman with vision and Harvey could be that kind of chairman The decision to nominate Mr Pitt was welcomed by Senator Phil Gramm the Republican Chairman of the Senate banking committee which oversees the SEC I look forward to working with him and anticipate prompt consideration of his nomination by the banking committee he said Mr Pitt is known as a tireless worker who employs three secretaries to work round the clock for him Some people are going to have to run quicker and run longer to keep up with him but the vast majority of people here are delighted with the choice said one SEC staff member Mr Pitt will be closely watched in the coming months for his views on several controversial rules passed in the final year of Mr Levitts term Among them are those on overseeing consulting services by accounting firms and a new disclosure rule Regulation Fair Disclosure fiercely opposed by securities firms The administration encountered unexpected difficulty in filling the top SEC job Several leading candidates withdrew from the process or turned down offers Mr Bush still has to fill forthcoming vacancies among the SECs commissioners He named Laura Unger a corn missioner as acting SEC chairman soon after Arthur Levitt stepped down Bush Intends to Nominate Roseboro for Treasury Job The Wall Street Journal May WASHINGTON President Bush announced his intent to nominate Brian C Roseboro of New York financialservices giant American International Group Inc to be assistant Treasury secretary for financial markets The job involves making and implementing policy on capital markets and federaldebt management Mr Roseboro is deputy director of marketrisk management for AIG Mr Roseboro earlier worked at financialservices firm SBC Warburg Dillon Reed from to and at First National Bank of Chicago from to the White House said From to he held several positions at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York including chief dealer for foreignexchange trading Election records show Mr Roseboro didnt contribute to Mr Bushs presidential campaign although AIGs political action committee contributed to it and also gave to his GOP rival Arizona Sen John McCain AIG Chairman Maurice Hank Greenberg raised at least for Mr Bush in the insurance and financialservices industries Darwinism With Chinese Characteristics The Asian Wall Street Journal May By Pu Yonghao The expansion of Chinas capital markets is central to the governments plan to finance longterm economic growth While observers have focused primarily on efforts to reform and broaden the equity markets two other developments are important to meet the objective a mature debt market and a wider variety of derivative products About companies are listed on Chinas domestic stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen About are stateowned enterprises and some of the total issued shares are state held The two bourses combined had a market capitalization of billion at end of though some twothirds about billion of A shares which can be purchased only by Chinese investors are in state hands Chinese companies generally turn to banks for funding By the end of bank lending was billion equivalent to of Chinas gross domestic product In the wake of the Asian financial crisis the government realized that a dependence on bank lending leaves both the corporate and banking sectors vulnerable to crises That is why it has decided to expand the capital markets to finance longterm growth If all goes well the market cap of the two boards together is likely to double to trillion by and play a leading role in the countrys evolution into a market economy The reasons for this kind of growth are numerous First Chinas economy should grow at an annual average rate of between bringing total GDP to about trillion based on an inflation of The countrys high savings rate of currently billion should provide ample capital to facilitate the expansion Second the government is pushing forward with the reform of SOEs Privatization the reduction state holdings and expansion of the private sector will increase the marketcapitalizationtoGDP ratio Listing SOEs will deepen the restructuring program and usher in good corporate governance Moreover the governments fiscal resources are limited Revenues comprise only of GDP and socialwelfare costs are rising The growth of the stock markets is likely to help expand Chinas private sector and bolster employment at a time when many SOEs are downsizing their labor forces The stock markets will also become an important vehicle for channeling longterm investment and thus help increase the efficient allocation of capital and improve returns on infrastructure projects And finally foreign investors and investment banks are expected to play an active role in the domestic markets after Chinas accession to the World Trade Organization But this picture of thriving capital markets will be incomplete without the speedy evolution of debt trading and derivative instruments The development of a debt market is important because bank savings remain Chinas primary investment vehicle despite a tax on deposit interest income and historically low interest rates Bonds generally offer relatively high returns with low risk and fill the gap between highreturn highrisk equities and lowreturn yet safe bank deposits Moreover social security funds need to hold bonds to balance their portfolios A mature debt market diversifies the financing channels of enterprises enabling them to gain capital leverage Debt pricing is more sensitive to interest rates spurring more efficient capital pricing and thus allocation A mature debt market can also help finance the states budget deficit and provide capital for longterm construction projects Government bonds enable effective monetary policy through openmarket operations The use of bonds to control the base money supply reduces the reliance on a credit plan for implementing macroeconomic objectives The governments ability to conduct openmarket operations can help it control the impact of external capital inflows The Chinese government appears to be drafting debtmarket regulations that will allow the listing of more corporate bonds firms to use the proceeds as they see fit and new debt products But many other issues need to be addressed before the debt market can take off First an environment of commercial trust and a system for contract enforcement and liquidation must be established Second a comprehensive and reliable creditrating system is needed Some mainland Chinese rating agencies are pressured to make positive evaluations When rating agencies are reliable investors can better gauge whether a company will repay Third a benchmark rate and yield curve must be established Currently the benchmark couponrate on debt is a oneyear deposit rate of but this is not entirely appropriate The coupon rate is for example on a fiveyear treasury bond for a threeyear treasury bond and capped on the former at This provides little scope for corporates to price new issues attractively The average yield of listedcorporate debts is already or for maturity of more than five years Moreover debt markets need to merge At present trading occurs at exchanges or between banks Since trading volume is small and liquidity low prices face distortion The trading volume of enterprise bonds for example is just of treasury bonds Finally there is need for a wider range of debt products for example floatingrate bonds as opposed to simply fixedrate debt instruments As it stands now there only about types of corporate debts Most are zerocoupon bonds one is floating The development of derivative products would provide another important impetus to growth of the capital markets Mainlanders have few financial products to choose from just plus listed stocks and a handful of corporate bonds and closedend funds China does have some futures exchanges but trading is limited to a few commodities like soybeans wheat and copper The trading of derivatives would enhance economic efficiency First they enable investors and underwriters to hedge their positions and lock in profits Second derivatives temper stockprice volatility by reducing the concentration of money in one market Once an index derivative market is established variance between two markets can prompt arbitrage opportunities Derivatives also enable better risk management attracting more capital to the stock markets especially risksensitive pension insurance and offshore funds However the value of mature capital markets goes beyond capitalization Full fledged they can force enterprises to compete for funds weeding out the weak from the strong Last month the China Securities Regulatory Commission delisted washingmachine maker Narcissus from the Shanghai Stock Exchange after the company racked up four consecutive years of losses The rules for stripping companies of their listing had been murky but the CSRC assertively clarified them in February saying firms posting three or more years of losses would be given just six months to make a profit or face delisting Narcissus soon came back with a turnaround plan but the Shanghai exchange rejected it claiming the proposal was unworkable Thats just one example of an array of reforms regulators are pressing ahead with to bring Chinas capital markets in line with the survivalofthefittest ethos that characterizes their more mature counterparts elsewhere Mr Pu is senior economist at

slide into downward spiral Financial Times Accounting Shift Lifts Deutsche Profits American Banker Argentinas strife not over yet Financial Times Feds McDonough sees global strains from slowdown Reuters English News Service May NEW YORK May Reuters Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William McDonough said on Thursday the international financial system is showing some signs of strain from a slowdown in global growth McDonough in remarks prepared for delivery to a banking group in Frankfurt Germany said there is no broad agreement on how to handle international financial crises During the latter part of the s the international financial system has endured perhaps its greatest stress in the postwar period and currently we again are seeing signs of strain associated with the global slowdown in growth McDonough said in a text of his speech released in advance The New York Fed chief did not comment further on the global economy or discuss the US economy in the speech which focused on global financial stability McDonough is also chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision which recently completed a new accord on bank capital standards There is a broad consensus on the need to strengthen financial institutions at the national and international level in order to create more crisis resistant economies McDonough said But there is no comparable degree of consensus on how to best handle international financial crises once they do erupt In particular there is unease that the current approach to crisis management that has evolved out of the experiences in Mexico and Asia notwithstanding its successes in some cases entails solutions that are potentially too costly he said Critics feel the solutions entailed repeated reliance on largescale support packages introduced adverse incentives or moral hazard and were in themselves a source of uncertainty and potential instability McDonough added He advocated a flexible casebycase approach to crisis management adding that regulators should strive for minimalist intervention The role of regulators is not to limit banks opportunities for growth and profit At the same time if we encourage responsible behavior we must not create the illusion that we will rescue every institution that does not succeed he said McDonough Advocates Flexible Approach To Prevent Cope With Financial Crises BNA May By Jeffrey Goldfarb A flexible casebycase approach with minimal intervention by regulators is the best way to prevent and cope with financial crises said William McDonough the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Speaking May in Frankfurt Germany McDonough said bank supervisors around the world should be working to enable banks to better manage their businesses and their risks At the same time if we are to encourage responsible behavior we must not create the illusion that we will rescue every institution that does not succeed he said McDonough said that disclosure practices by banks although improved over the past decade have not kept up with the many changes in the way they manage their risk He recommended that banks rethink what they consider proprietary information It is critical to approach the question of disclosure as users of financial statements he said Shareholders creditors and counterparties cannot understand the risks of their own exposures to a bank until they first understand that banks appetite for risk and its approach to and methodologies for managing risk What should drive this debate is market participants need for information to make sound and secure credit and investment decisions rather than the concerns some have about what was once considered secret Amidst his remarks an advance text of which was released in New York McDonough briefly commented on the state of the global economy saying there are some unfavorable signals During the latter part of the s the international financial system has endured perhaps its greatest stress in the postwar period and currently we again are seeing signs of strain associated with the global slowdown in growth he said McDonough explained that the solutions to recent crises in Mexico and Asia even though successful may have led to certain currently held tenets that are too costly introduce adverse incentives or moral hazards and are in themselves a source of uncertainty and potential instability But the alternatives he said look even more unpalatable in their implications Notwithstanding considerable efforts at the public and private level to search for a better way no magic bullet formula has been found Nor is one likely to be available In essence McDonough said the quest for some broad universal solution to financial crises is a Pollyannalike pursuit If history is any guide he said new developments in markets and practices quickly will render obsolete those measures that might seem well attuned to todays circumstances For that reason McDonough encouraged a supremely tactical and creative casebycase approach to handling crises He specifically argued against standstill solutions which suspend debt service usually in conjunction with the imposition of capital controls McDonough said that approach in his opinion could make investors skittish and make it harder to generate support for honoring contractual commitments Standstills also undermine market discipline of and ownership by the local authorities he said To sum up I believe the one size fits all disposition inherent in the standstills approach risks making situations much worse than they need to be he said The only thing that strikes me as predictable under such an approach would be that market access would be harmed across the board Just as bailouts may encourage too much risk taking efforts to orchestrate preemptive bailins may encourage too little Gramm Says Changed Markets Demand Dramatic Review Reform of Securities Laws BNA May By Rachel Witmer Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm RTexas said May that the changes in the US securities markets since the s and especially in the last years demand a dramatic review and reform of securities regulation Gramm had previously announced his intention to conduct a toptobottom review all of the securities laws with the intention of modernizing them Speaking at a meeting of the Security Traders Association Gramm said that the review will be openended and that he will not prejudge the conclusions from the effort The senator said that the question he asks in looking at laws and regulations is Are the benefits of this regulation in the market as it exists today worth what were paying for them In addition he emphasized that there will continue to be dramatic change in the markets and said I want the change to be dictated by the markets and not the government One change that he suggested might come in the long run is that securities markets per se could become a thing of the past Im not certain that markets are not obsolete he said Later in his remarks Gramm clarified his statement saying I dont know if markets make sense any more He made an analogy between markets and traditional book stores which have serious competition from online book stores The Internet has revolutionized the book market Gramm said He then asked Is a centralized market necessary NYSEs Survival At another point in his remarks Gramm suggested that as allelectronic markets are proliferating and changing competition in the securities markets the New York Stock Exchanges survival is not guaranteed In other comments Gramm emphasized that while he may refer an individual to the White House for consideration as a potential nominee for the chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission the president is going to name the chairman and not me Asked about the length of time it is taking for the White House to nominate someone for that position Gramm said I dont see that any great harm is coming from it Gramm told reporters after his remarks that he hoped the administration will nominate someone who was knowledgeable openminded and free market Finding all those qualities on one person is hard he said On the topic of decimals Gramm said that he did not see the recent decimalization of the securities markets as a fundamental reform As of April all securities are priced and traded in decimals instead of fractions While on the House side there is some interest in exploring the effects of decimalization Gramm said I dont see anything in it now that would induce me to want to go back and hold hearings about it Lack of banking safeguards in HK Financial Times May By Joe Leahy Hong Kong lacks many of the formal safeguards in place in the UK and Australia to protect banking consumers said a study yesterday by the territorys de facto central bank Joe Leahy reports from Hong Kong Hong Kong has no general competition law no regulator with an explicit mandate for protecting banking consumers and no ombudsman scheme to process complaints the consultative study by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority HKMA found As the Hong Kong market is becoming more sophisticated and more competitive and as consumer issues are coming more to the fore it is timely to consider whether the current arrangements in Hong Kong remain appropriate it said Despite its probusiness bias Hong Kong has been forced to reexamine the issue of depositor protection following moves to deregulate the banking sector Japan risks slide into downward spiral Financial Times May By Gillian Tett Falling exports to Asia and the US and the fragility of its banking system mean Japan risks sliding into a downward spiral with severe regional consequences for trade the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned yesterday in its latest halfyearly report The OECD report says Japan may need to bail out the banks a move the government has ruled out The report comes at a critical time for the new government of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi The Parisbased thinktank attracts considerable respect in Japan and Mr Koizumi is due to make his inaugural speech to parliament on Monday in which he will set out the governments economic policy The OECD report asserts that the level of bad loans is probably larger than the government admits meaning that some banks may not have sufficient capital to write off their bad debts In some cases realistic writeoffs might even wipe out the capital altogether requiring banks to reduce the scale of their operations raise capital in the market or seek public financial support it says The condition of the banking system is likely to be a key focus of Mr Koizumis speech He has pledged to introduce measures to clear out the bad loans rapidly under pressure from countries such as the US The government insists the banks have sufficient capital to complete this task Public funds should be injected only when the financial system faces a crisis Hakuo Yanagisawa financial reform minister said recently Some Ybn Dollars bn of public funds were injected into the largest banks in But many analysts and diplomats fear that without government help the banks will be too weak to write off their bad loans rapidly The mountain of bad loans has damaged corporate confidence and left the financial sector reluctant to lend However forcing banks to cut their loans to unviable borrowers could lead to more bankruptcies and rising unemployment in the short term the OECD admits Managing the loan cleanup will be a huge task for the authorities in particular as flagging confidence may dictate that it will have to be carried out in a short period of time it says The timing of the cleanup is unfortunate since Japan is suffering the knockon effects of the slowdown in the rest of the global economy through lower exports The OECD suggests that if more funds are injected into the banks that the bank managers should be sacked and the shareholders should not be rescued However any fresh injections of public funds could trigger strong public protest It could also fuel Japans spiraling debt burden which is projected to hit per cent of GDP in and per cent next year The OECD calculates the government will need to tighten fiscal policy by percentage points of GDP by simply to stabilise the debt This is currently equivalent to Ybn a sum exceeding total central government tax revenue On current growth trends tax revenue would therefore need to be doubled if the adjustment occurred on the tax side alone The OECD added that monetary policy would need to be highly supportive It expects to see per cent growth in calendar and per cent growth next year higher than many analysts are projecting Accounting Shift Lifts Deutsche Profits American Banker May FRANKFURT Deutsche Bank AG Europes largest bank said Thursday that firstquarter earnings rose fueled by lower taxes and a new accounting rule for derivatives even as revenue from investment banking declined Net income climbed to million or a share The results included a gain of million from the accounting change Chief executive Rolf Breuer is trying to reduce Deutsche Banks reliance on investment banking and emphasize businesses such as fund management and consumer banking Rivals in the securities business including Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported lower profit in the first quarter Deutsche Bank said its investment banking revenue declined Another rival reported a similar expectation I expect to see growth from asset management and personal banking this year said Helmut Hipper who helps manage about billion at Union Invest GmbH in Frankfurt Investment banking wont be the main driver Deutsche Bank shares fell Thursday by after having risen in early trading Without the accounting gain profit was down in the first quarter Under a new International Accounting Standards Board rule called IAS changes in the value of certain derivatives were included in trading income for the first time If we take away the accounting change profit was down in the first quarter said Manfred Bleijenberg an analyst at Delta

this an improvement in our profit situation compared with our competition Argentinas strife not over yet Financial Times May By Thomas Catan For the past six months Argentinas markets have been dominated by a single question can the country restart its economy in time to avoid a default on its Dollars bn in debt The answer is not yet clear In his first six weeks back in charge of the economy Domingo Cavallo has done much to improve a bad situation after nearly three years of recession He has transformed a fractious political scene and restored the backing of the International Monetary Fund His task was complicated by the fact that Argentina missed its first quarter fiscal target Mr Cavallo has taken a range of measures to rein in the burgeoning fiscal deficit to meet the Dollars bn target agreed with the IMF for this year Most recently he moved to eliminate virtually all exemptions on value added tax cut Dollars m in spending and increased a tax on financial transactions from per cent to per cent But those steps have only increased concern that Argentina will not climb out of recession in spite of his prediction this week that the economy will be growing at a per cent clip in the last quarter of the year Mr Cavallos strategy is unconventional To restart growth he has eliminated import tariffs on capital goods to encourage investment as well as cut VAT on those items from per cent to per cent He will also unveil a series of competitiveness plans for sectors of industry that have been hurt by the overvaluation of the peso over the past couple of years The aim is to regain competitiveness without breaking the decadeold peg to the dollar which would be disastrous in a country where the vast majority of public and private sector debt is denominated in dollars But investors still question whether the strategy can work and have pushed interest rates up to astronomical levels Because of those rates Argentina has long been unable to borrow on international markets Last week it was forced for the first time to cancel a biweekly auction of treasury bills Investors will be watching closely to see if Argentina can hold its next scheduled auction on May If it cannot then the fears that the country will have to restructure its debt will again grow stronger stoking volatility throughout emerging markets Following a brief rally at the start of the year Argentinas stock market has again languished But razorthin trading volumes make the countrys Merval a poor indicator of market sentiment Over the past couple of months it has hovered in a range of to Yesterday

Proposes FirstEver Regulation To Govern Limits on Affiliate Transactions BNA ISDA lobbies FASB on swaps Financial Times May By Vincent Boland The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has expressed concern that proposed changes to US accounting standards and tax regulations could have a negative impact on swaps transactions In a submission to the US Federal Accounting Standards Board ISDA said that definitions of liabilities and equity as residual interest were adequate and that it had asked the FASB to reconsider proposed changes and to retain the current accounting model It also said in a submission to the Internal Revenue Service that it was concerned that proposed changes to hedging regulations did not properly implement Congressional intent with regard to risk management standards that qualify for hedging treatment Corporates warm to charms of credit derivatives Reuters English News Service May By Tom Bergin European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments to hedge the risk their debtors wont pay up market participants said on Thursday Credit derivatives are insurancelike tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt They are mainly used by banks hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments The market remains small with only around a dozen nonfinancial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options We see corporate use as a big growth area for credit derivatives maybe the biggest says Bryan Seyfried vicepresident of Enron Credit in London Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other nonfinancial corporates Ralf Lierow director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives too he added This is not a trading book thing For us the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management Lierow said HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group It first started using credit derivatives in July Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business Lierow said Siemens uses credit default swaps the most liquid type of credit derivatives to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time the company tries to match this with default swap positions Hence if a customer fails to pay Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently There are occasional corporate users that have secured oneoff requirements for balancesheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction said Walter Gontarek head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible dealers said NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court However traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind The International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a payout in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtors failure to pay We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables Lierow said These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives There is little experience of the instruments which are barely a decade old in the corporate world Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin Clive Banks UK head of derivatives sales to buyside clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved Its about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces he said OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool Lierow said that Siemens which currently only buys credit protection planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the companys activities are concentrated You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals he said Fed Proposes Rules On Derivatives Intraday Lending Dow Jones May By Dawn Kopecki The Federal Reserve Board Wednesday proposed regulations that would place restrictions on intraday lending as well as on derivatives contracts between banks and their affiliates The Fed is seeking public comment on the proposal which would apply rule A of the Federal Reserve Act to derivatives contracts as well as to intraday extensions of credit The proposal is designed to limit a banks exposure to risk from an ailing affiliate Section A limits the ability of an insured depository institution to extend credit to or purchase assets from an affiliate It also establishes collateral requirements for credit transactions between banks and their affiliates Fed officials also proposed to extend rule B which requires that transactions between banks and their affiliates be on market terms to derivatives and intraday loans Under the interim rule overthecounter OTC derivatives contracts would have to be collateralized and the terms of the contract would have to reflect market prices Banks would also have to have procedures in place to handle derivatives transactions and intraday lending The interim rule which is not yet final and could change would go into effect Jan Its primary goal will be to establish barriers protecting depository institutions from the problems of a failing affiliate said Anthony Santomero president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia in a speech earlier this year Even with the best of intentions this regulation will prove difficult to codify and will be subject to close scrutiny The proposal was precipitated by legislation passed in late that overhauled the US financial service sector The GrammLeachBliley Act also required the Fed to issue rules by May on derivatives transactions done by banks The Federal Reserve Board also unanimously adopted a new rule that exempts certain transactions between banks and their affiliates from those same collateral standards as well as from other restrictions For example loans made by a bank to an unaffiliated borrower that then uses the loan to buy securities underwritten or sold by a brokerage affiliated with the bank would be exempt from rule A Banks urged to improve credit operational risk disclosure IFR April International banks will need to increase credit and operational risk disclosure to regulators according to a report issued by the Bank for International Settlements last week There is still a long way to go compared with the current practice said an official at the regulatory body Disclosure related to credit derivatives and banks use of internal credit risk rating methods as well as disclosure of methods for measuring and assessing operational risk was lacking the BIS report found Fewer than half of the banks that use credit derivatives disclosed their strategies and objectives for the use of such instruments it noted Furthermore only of banks disclosed a breakdown of type of credit derivative instrument used notional and fair values and the amount of credit risk bought or sold it added Similarly few banks provided summary information on the quality of on and offbalance sheet credit exposures based on internal ratings or external ratings the report said noting that this is an area where disclosure could be improved According to the report less than one quarter of the banks described how internal ratings are used in the banks capital allocation process The adequacy of disclosure related to the use of internal ratings will be an area of increased importance under the new Basle Capital Accord as banks will need to qualify to allow their internal based approaches to be considered the BIS report said Overall banks did disclose their objectives and strategies in using derivatives to hedge risks with of banks disclosing their objectives for the use of nontrading derivatives Fiftyseven banks from the Basle Committee member countries took part in the survey conducted by the BIS transparency working group The report found that while of respondents disclosed their riskbased capital ratio in accordance with the methods prescribed in the Basle Capital Accord only provided all of the information relevant to understanding how Basle requirements for market risk under internal models have been calculated Further only half of those surveyed disclosed whether they had an internal process for assessing capital adequacy and for setting appropriate levels of capital The absence of existing guidance at the time of the study is the likely reason for the poor marks for disclosure on operational risk management They should see how their operational risk management practices compare with guidance released in January said a BlS official A discussion paper elaborating on the tenets of the Basle Committees January proposal is slated for release toward the end of the summer The aim of the paper will be to assist banks in their implementation of the final proposal which is due for release at the end of the year The Basle Committee in its most recent draft proposals indicated its intention to levy an operational risk capital charge Although the BIS conducts annual reports on bank disclosure practices the survey cannot be compared directly with previous surveys as its focus shifted away from trading and derivatives to cover other areas such as operational risk Argentina crisis default swap ripples contained IFR April Argentine default swaps drove out last week as the sovereign teetered on the brink of a forced restructuring of its debt The ripple effect on credit default swaps in other Latin American sovereigns was limited however and even Argentine quotes were well off their highs by the end of the week Investment grade corporate default swaps mostly fell on the back of a wave of CDO portfolio position unwinds There was oneyear Argentina default swap trade as high as bp last Monday but by the end of the week the maturity was quoted at bpbp For much of the week the market was illiquid with major dealers saying that they would only come inside bidoffer spreads to do client trades There was mild curve inversion in Argentina by the end of the week with twoyear quotes at lOObpbp the fiveyear at bpbp and the year at bpbp The basis between default swaps and the asset swap value of Argentine FRB debt was very wide For much of the week FRBs were trading at levels at least bp tighter than the apparent realistic midpoint for default swaps Before the most recent crisis in confidence over Argentinas ability to raise funds and to maintain its currency peg to the dollar its default swaps were trading at levels tighter than the asset swap value of comparable FRBs Brazilian default swap levels were not hit as hard as those in Argentina and Mexican credit protection swaps did not suffer contamination from Argentinas troubles There was oneyear trading in Brazil default swaps seen at least as high as bp but quotes in the maturity at the end of the week were at bpbp Brazils default curve also remained positive with the threeyear at bpbp at the end of the week the fiveyear at bpbp and the year at bpbp The basis between the asset swap value of Mexican dollar debt and its default swap prices remained at a comparatively tight Obpbp which

Richard Cowden The Federal Reserve Board unveiled one of its most important regulatory projects in recent years on May and asked for comment on a proposed regulation that would implement key provisions in federal law limiting transactions between banks and their affiliates As required by Congress the Fed also released an interim rule to cover aspects of those transactions and finalized another rule that addresses exemptions from the law The proposed Regulation W marks the first time the Fed has formulated rules implementing restrictions under Sections A and B of the Federal Reserve Act two of the most important laws for federallyinsured banks Although the Fed has offered advice and interpretation before with respect to Sections A and B it has done so using legal rulings and advisory letters geared to specific cases Now the Fed is updating those interpretations and putting all of the information in one place The proposed Regulation W seeks to provide users with a single comprehensive reference tool for complying with and analyzing issues arising under sections A and B the Fed said Action in Three Parts In its May meeting the Fed took three distinct actions The Fed issued an interim rule effective Jan that requires banks to establish policies and procedures to monitor and control credit exposure from intraday credits and derivatives transactions with affiliates Although the effective date is delayed banks are expected to get to work on the new policies and procedures as soon as possible The interim rule also clarifies that both types of transactions are covered under Section B which means that banks will have to treat those transactions as armslength transactions just as they would with any other third party The Fed expressly declined to rule on whether derivative transactions between banks and affiliates are covered transactions under Section A asked for comment on the main text the proposed new Regulation W which would incorporate many existing Fed pronouncements and interpretations applying Sections A and B as well as adding some important new wrinkles and issued a final rule setting out various transactions that are eligible for exemption from Section A The rule was originally proposed June In addition the Fed is allowing opportunity for further comment on some of the exceptions during the comment process for the proposed Regulation W Why the Rule Matters The Feds threepart initiative is significant because Sections A and B are important statutes that protect banks from losses due to transactions with affiliated institutions such as securities units or mortgage firms According to the Fed the increasing scope and complexity of bank operations in recent years sparked more requests for guidance especially in connection with Section A which places quantitative limits on affiliate transactions And if transactions with affiliates were important before they are even more important now In Congress passed the GrammLeachBliley Act the financial services modernization law that was expressly crafted to allow even broader affiliations between banks securities companies and insurance firms The GLB Act which also amended key provisions in sections A and B gave the Fed until May to adopt rules addressing credit exposure in connection with intraday credits and derivatives transactions with affiliated institutions The Fed accomplished that task by issuing the interim rule Finally the rule is important because it could make things easier for everyone involved at least in theory By crafting an implementing rule for Sections A and B the Fed will be able to consolidate its doctrine In addition the rulemaking process gives bankers the opportunity to shape the final version of the rule Early Reaction Observers were still poring over the Feds initiative late May especially the interim rule and the newly proposed Regulation W They welcomed the Feds decision to delay the interim rules effective date saying the time between now and Jan will be put to good use Sarah A Miller general counsel of the American Bankers Association Securities Association told BNA May that the Fed took a fairly responsible approach especially in terms of taking limited action in the interim rule and leaving many of the tougher issues for the comment process Above all she said bankers hope that the rule once finished will provide muchneeded clarity with respect to Section A and Section B issues Were elated that the rule is out she said Miller also said the final rule on exemptions will be helpful especially provisions addressing certain loans to third parties She said the ABASA has been working for such changes since at least This is something our guys have been very much anticipating she told BNA Definitions at Issue Another analyst noted that the Fed gave a fairly narrow definition of intraday credits in the interim rule carving out exceptions for securities clearing and settlement transactions on behalf of affiliates Clearly they didnt want to interrupt normal daytoday dealings that dont present any real risk the analyst told BNA However there was some disquiet over other aspects of the Feds action For example analysts said the interim rule defines derivative transaction quite broadly so much so that many transactions will fall under the coverage of Section B According to the Fed derivative transaction means any derivative contract covered by the Boards capital adequacy guidelines which includes most interestrate currency equity and commodity derivative contracts and any similar derivative contract including credit derivative contracts Another potential sticking point is how the proposed Regulation W addresses independent credit judgments under CFR an interpretive rule The proposal establishes a brightline quantitative test but goes on to give bank examiners significant discretion to decide whether a bank has shown the independence required to gain a critical exemption under the rule Under the proposal even if the bank meets the quantitative test it may still be denied the exemption if the examiner decides that the bank is providing substantial and ongoing funding to the affiliate More Exemptions Could Be on the Way The Regulation W proposal also allows bankers to comment on potential additions to the exemptions in the final rule One would involve purchases by a bank of municipal securities from a brokerdealer affiliate that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission according to a Fed staffer Among other requirements the municipal securities must be eligible for purchase by a state member bank and must be rated by a nationally recognized rating organization or it must be part of a pool of securities of less than million Another would allow certain companies to charter a new bank and transfer assets to the new bank from affiliated institutions outside the restrictions of Section A A third possible exemption would govern certain credit card transactions A Fed official explained a typical case in which the proposed exemption would apply If a bank loan to a third party is pursuant to a general purpose credit card like a Visa or Mastercard and the third party buys a product from an affiliate of the bank were going to basically ignore that transaction he said Another Fed official said the purpose of the exemption was to accommodate extensions of credit that are not designed to subsidize an affiliate of the bank through transactions that elude the Sections A and B limitations Comments Due in Days The proposed rule applies to all federallyinsured banks However even though Congress has extended coverage of Sections A and B to savings associations the Office of Thrift Supervision OTS will have to craft its own rule the Fed said OTS officials told BNA May that they are studying the Feds proposal Comments on the proposal are due days after it is published in the Federal Register All existing Fed interpretations and staff opinions remain in effect until the new Regulation W becomes final Scott Marra Administrator for Policy Media Relations ISDA Fifth Avenue Rockefeller Center th

projected to grow by between only and percent during even with the boost that will be provided by the expected growth of between and percent during the second half of the year the central bank said in its semiannual Monetary Policy Report The bank had indicated in a Feb update of its last semiannual report that it expected the Canadian economy to grow by about percent during based on US growth of percent It now looks as if growth over the first six months will average between and percent For the second half of the year we see growth picking up significantly to between and percent the latest report said The pace of activity in is expected to be somewhat stronger than in the second half of with the economy expanding at a rate slightly above the Banks estimate of potential output growth of percent Meanwhile the anticipated reemergence of excess supply in the Canadian economy will contribute to continued downward pressure on core inflation during the remainder of and core inflation is expected to average slightly less than percent for the remainder of then to increase to about percent by the end of the Monetary Policy Report said Increases in the overall Consumer Price Index are expected to remain volatile over the next few months but then to also fall to about percent by the end of the year if world energy prices remain near current levels it said The central bank stressed that the main risk to its projections for the Canadian economy remain the timing and strength of the projected resurgence of the US economy and the report noted that it will continue to monitor developments closely and make further adjustments to its trendsetting Bank Rate as necessary For example if consumer and business confidence in the United States does not improve this could lead to weaker consumption and investment spending it said Another development that the Bank will have to watch closely because of its possible implications for aggregate demand and inflation in Canada is the shift in international financial market sentiment that has led to a strengthening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar and other currencies SEC Urges More Use of Fair Value Pricing The Wall Street Journal May By Judith Burns US mutual funds cant rely on stale prices when calculating the value of their portfolios a senior Securities and Exchange Commission attorney said In a letter to the Investment Company Institute a leading fundindustry group Douglas Scheidt general counsel of the SECs investmentmanagement division said funds should be on the lookout for events that might require them to use fair value prices for certain securities rather than relying on the last quoted price Mr Scheidt said funds cant ignore major changes affecting pricing that occur after trading closes but before the calculation of the net asset value of the securities in fund portfolios Mutual funds typically compute their NAV once a day after the close of securities trading in major US markets using readily available quotations When that isnt possible funds must base calculations on the fair value of a security When calculating fairmarket value the SEC said funds should use appropriate methods to determine the price they might reasonably expect to receive in a current sale It recommended funds compare fairmarket pricing results with the nextday opening prices or actual sales prices to refine their pricing techniques and avoid using market quotes from dealers and pricing services that prove unreliable Funds that automatically use market quotations to calculate their NAVs without first verifying that the market quotations are readily available cannot be assured that the resulting NAVs are accurate Mr Scheidt wrote in his letter dated Monday Accuracy could be called into question if a fund ignores developments in markets such as Tokyo or Hong Kong which close to hours ahead of the US closing the SEC attorney said Market swings natural disasters terrorist activity or a major change in government or policy could have dramatic effect on foreign securities prices If a fund determines a significant event has occurred after a market closes that would affect the value of a security it holds the fund must use fair value pricing methodology rather than the closing price when valuing its portfolio said Mr Scheidt Funds cant just put their head in the sand Mr Scheidt said yesterday in an interview The ICI said it plans to distribute Mr Scheidts comments to its members The letter will be useful in providing guidance to the funds on this matter ICI spokesman John Collins said Fair value pricing isnt limited to nonUS securities In cases where trading in a US security is halted or there is a significant development after an early market close funds should no longer rely on the closing price or last quotation when calculating their NAV according to the SEC staff letter On the other hand where market quotes are deemed reliable it said funds must continue to use them and cant switch to fair value pricing Fair value pricing has been controversial for funds in recent years In the fall of there was an outcry from investors who complained they bought and sold shares without realizing some fund companies including Fidelity Investments relied on fair value pricing after Asian markets swooned Fidelity calculated an increase in the value of its Hong Kong and China fund using fairmarket pricing Investors could be harmed if a fund doesnt use fair value pricing since it could generate arbitrage activity that dilutes shareholder value the SEC letter noted If the funds NAV doesnt reflect uptotheminute changes shares could be overpriced benefiting investors who sell their stake while harming those who overpay to acquire shares Conversely if the fund is underpriced sellers would suffer at the expense of buyers Fair value pricing can protect longterm fund investors from shortterm investors who seek to take advantage of such situations Mr Scheidt said Additionally the SEC urged funds to provide investors with more information on when and how they will use fair value pricing saying plain English disclosure could reduce shareholders complaints about the practice and discourage arbitrage activity Small frys curbed Business Standard May By Sangita Shah The introduction of individual stock futures and options to replace the carry forward system will drive out the small retail investors from the stock markets market sources said According to market participants while derivatives as instruments have always been an alien system to the Indian market the technicalities involved will leave domestic investors bewildered The introduction of index futures in June can be termed as anything but successful This can be proved by the fact that the average daily volume of sensex futures has not crossed Rs crore Even Nifty futures which has performed better in terms of liquidity has barely registered an average daily volume of Rs crore This is a fraction of the cash market turnover of Rs crore collectively in a stable market Lack of understanding as to how the derivatives in stock markets are to be operated is the major roadblock in the success of the futures and options market in our country Bhavin Shah a derivatives trader at a domestic firm said In fact even the LC Gupta Committee has noted in its report in March that derivatives are not always clearly understood A few wellpublicised debacles sic involving derivatives trading in other countries has also created widespread apprehensions in the Indian publics mind While economic literature recognises the efficiency enhancing effect of derivatives on the economy in general and the financial markets in particular the Committee felt the need for educating public opinion as also the need to ensure effective regulatory checks It is worth mentioning that while regulatory checks have been implemented it has failed to educate public opinion Under the circumstances it is probably highhandedness on the part of the authorities to thrust upon them an alien system without giving an opportunity for smooth transition a fund manager said on conditions of anonymity However the fact should also be considered that if futures and options in individual stocks are introduced in the country India will be among the handful of global exchanges which have these systems The problem is compounded by the fact that there are few international precedents for India to draw on in the matter of options and futures in individual stocks The difficulty of defining a default Euromoney April Its not difficult to see why the market is so taken with credit default swaps For the protection buyer they are a quick and easy way for investors worried about a particular credit risk whether originally taken on via bonds loans trade notes or derivative counterparty exposure to gain reassurance without having to dispose of assets For sellers of protection default swaps provide the opportunity to buy into sectors to which they may have little or no exposure while avoiding the need to make a large capital investment up front The buyer pays a premium to the seller in return for an agreement that if a default occurs the seller pays a sum equal to the value lost and assumes ownership of the defaulted assets For their part dealers enthuse about being able to amalgamate limited liquidity in different parts of the market and convert it into a readily tradable instrument One of the big advantages of credit default swaps is that they are in pure derivative form says Glenn Barnes global cohead of credit derivatives at Merrill Lynch Its not like credit insurance where you have to suffer a loss before you get paid Credit default swaps have quickly become the largest component of the credit derivatives market making up over twothirds of global business According to Merrill Lynch the credit derivatives market accounted for billion of notional value in a figure estimated to top trillion by Derivatives are now absolutely central to the whole credit benchmark says Tim Frost European head of credit derivatives at JP Morgan Bond issues cannot be priced without knowledge of credit swap prices While the threat of a bear market lingers credit default swaps can only grow in popularity as investors seek to insulate themselves against risk Up until three years ago the only liquid protection from risk available to bond investors was to go short on bonds and hope they got cheap enough to buy before they had to deliver says Gordon Black a managing director in credit derivatives at Bear Stearns However because the credit default swap market is now taking centre stage the structure of swap agreements is coming under much closer scrutiny At the heart of the debate is the question how to define a credit event In reacting to continued confusion in the market over the issue the International Swaps Derivatives Association ISDA published a list of conditions each of which is sufficient on its own trigger a swap agreement These credit events are bankruptcy failure to pay restructuring repudiation or moratorium obligation default and obligation acceleration At the time of publication ISDA stated that these definition were critical to the growth in demand fro credit derivative transactions For a while this kept market participant quiet Although most felt that the arrangement was by no means perfect they were happy to use ISDAs list as the basis of their credit default swap contracts Having a blueprint for swap agreements attracted greater numbers of investors with no previous experience of default swaps and liquidity boomed But it wasnt long before the flaws in the plan began to surface At the end of following a year of catastrophic results and event risk USbased financialservices company Conseco restructured over billion of debt With the agreement of its banks it extended the maturity of its bonds and loans until the end of Under ISDA rules this triggered default and banks that had written protection for parties exposed to Conseco found themselves having to pay out Initially we were fairly confident about ISDA including restructuring instead of the old material change We saw it as a step on the road to default explains Black But people failed to recognize at the start that restructuring is not the same as default You cant demand par value in the case of a default This exposed the seller not only to credit risk but market risk as well In response to growing dissatisfaction with ISDAs guidelines some market participants have gone about simplifying matters unilaterally Dealers at a number of major US houses have decided to remove restructuring from the list of credit events included in credit default swap contracts There is a liquid market for these swaps in the US which trade at a discount to those with a restructuring clause Other institutions have attempted to establish a market in swaps that carry a more limited definition of default Enron an energy trader that is also a large dealer in credit markets is trying to build a market in pure bankruptcy contracts where bankruptcy is the only event that can trigger payment Regulators are warning investors to pay particular attention to the contract when they enter a credit default swap deal Even banks arent immune from confusion Last month it emerged that UBS Warburg was suing Deutsche Bank over an unpaid obligation UBS bought protection from Deutsche on Armstrong World lndustries which meant that if AWl defaulted on its payment or went bankrupt Deutsche would have to pay UBS so million In December AXTI filed for bankruptcy but in the meantime it had undergone a reorganization and created a holding company So when UBS applied for payment from Deutsche the German bank refused to pay on the grounds the name on the contract didnt match the name of the entity that had defaulted The dispute nearly ended up in court In London in February at Euromoney Institutional Investors International Bond Congress David Clementi deputy governor of the Bank of England voiced concern about the rapid growth of the credit derivatives market It is intrinsically more difficult to standardize the definition of a credit event compared with that of a price or interest rate the underlying for most other derivative products he said Market participants will therefore have to pay even greater attention to documentation Its all in the contract Creditrating agency Moodys Investors Service too has expressed concern that investors dont always know what they are buying When investors enter an agreement with a derivatives trader theyre talking to someone who works with these products full time So theyre getting into something fairly technical with a dealer who knows much more about the subject than they do says Isaac Efrat managing director in the structured finance department at Moodys Investors always enter the market from the same direction of wanting to sell protection whereas dealers tend to hedge everything The risk has to go somewhere and my guess is that its going to investors he continues Bankers unsurprisingly dispute this saying that the rating agency is underestimating investors knowledge of the structures Frankly I think people do understand the risks very well says Barnes at Merrill Lynch Some of the most recent entrants to the market pension funds and hedge funds have quickly picked up how credit default swaps work Others say that the whole point f default swaps is the exposure to risk Moodys is raining on the parade says a credit derivatives trader Credit default swapsare supposed to synthetically create the risk profile of a bond The buyer acquires the risk and is paid for it But most admit that there are kinks in the market that need ironing out Most of these are to do with one particular type of credit event Restructuring is where things come unstuck says a market participant The current restructuring clause in credit protection is more in favour of the buyer says Antonio di Flumeri director of credit derivatives at Deutsche Bank He believes that a companys restructuring shouldnt give rise to a default Banks holding loans and protection have the opportunity to realise a windfall gain by restructuring those loans to trigger the swap then delivering a cheaper asset to the seller of protection di Flumeri says Barnes agrees From the dealers perspective it isnt fair if the holder of the asset consents to the restructuring of a loan but this then triggers a credit event payment he says This gives the bank Without such protection financial institutions would lose out on capital relief An alternative which has found more favour among bankers is to place restrictions on what is deliverable in the case of a restructuring Under present arrangements if a bank sells a fiveyear protection on a loan or bond with the same length maturity and that debt subsequently needs to be restructured the original lending bank can agree to any terms it chooses It might for example allow a company to extend its debt to a maturity date of years in the future Because a restructuring has taken place that bank can then exercise the default swap and the seller of the protection ends up owning year debt This can be a real problem if that investor has been marking the bond or loan to market What is cheapest for the buyer of protection to deliver may cause problems for those who have sold protection says Black The answer may be for ISDA to set a limit to the time over which debt can be restructured perhaps restricting it to the same maturity as the original loan or two or three years beyond it This would limit bankers discretion and help redress the balance The question is can we convince the banks that this isnt limiting their ability to restructure asks one trader Theyre going to say What youre telling me I can only restructure over two years Thats not much of a restructuring Theyll ask for well say three maybe well settle on five Whatever the outcome of this debate as Euromoney went to press ISDA had not yet announced its conclusions it needs to be resolved quickly Everyone realizes that something has to give says a credit derivatives trader This market has only existed for three years and theres only been any sort of meaningful liquidity for two The last thing we want to do is shoot ourselves in the foot Unless an agreement is reached soon theres a real danger that the emergence of default swaps without restructuring in the US could lead to the establishment of a twotier market Certainly the possibility of Europe excluding restructuring is a remote one Ive tried to do credit default swaps without it a couple of times in Europe and it just doesnt work says one derivatives trader So that leaves it to the US to back down Or does it European investors do often tend towards European names and the same situation occurs in the US and Asia says a banker In theory each jurisdiction could have its own treatment This wouldnt be a disaster but it would affect liquidity Moodys Efrat says I can easily envision a day when there will be a wide range of credit default swap contracts determining what counts as a default Stephen Selig counsel at Baer Marks Upham goes further There is no reason why contracts shouldnt be specific to particular deals he says Unless Im missing something I really dont see why the scope of the protection and what gives rise to a trigger of the swap cant be part of the individual contract between the buyer and the seller ISDA tries to cover every eventuality and all you get is a long and unreadable list of conditions For the sake of practicality not to mention liquidity it seems likely that ISDA will come down on the side of a single set of criteria The market needs a standard product says Black at Bear Stearns You dont want to have to compare documentation every time you do a credit default swap because different jurisdictions have different standards Participants want to use credit default swaps for different purposes some want to hedge receivables others use them as a synthetic asset class and others still to hedge loans So a blueprint is also essential to avoid exploitation of new entrants in the market At the limit if everyone developed a contract which suited their own needs perfectly there would be no trading at all says Frost at JP Morgan Opinions are divided on whether this debate is causing a slowdown in the credit default swap market Says Deutsche Banks Flumeri Volumes are the highest they have ever been so I dont think the debate is having a significant impact But according to another trader If there was a universally accepted contract for credit default swaps volumes would explode But whatever ISDA announces this is likely to be some way off If people are expecting credit swaps to be as vanilla as interest rate swaps then they are sadly mistaken says Frost at JP Morgan I expect to have retired before there is one standard contract that everybody around the world uses Scott Marra Administrator for Policy Media Relations ISDA Fifth Avenue

deliver Financial Times Merchant Banking Capital Proposal Draws a Chorus of Industry Criticism BNA Euro swap spreads seen sideways US to narrow Reuters Feds Greenspans speech to Bond Market Assn Reuters Enron Offers Structured Weather Note Derivatives Week Liquidity The ISDA Master Agreement Derivatives Week April Ensuring liquidity should be the primary goal in negotiating an ISDA Master Agreement the Agreement for smaller nonrated customers such as a hedge fund or a middlemarket corporation Often highly leveraged and with little room for error these customers should focus their efforts when negotiating the Agreement with a dealer on limiting the dealers opportunity to terminate the Agreement Unfortunately however customers typically through expensive outside counsel often instead use up valuable negotiating capital on esoteric legal issues that may only remotely affect a customers situation A dealer typically wants the right to terminate the Agreement at the first sign of its customers economic difficulties such as a cross default or a decline in the customers net worth Because of the fluctuating nature of derivatives a dealer wants to quickly terminate any growing exposure from outstanding transactions as its customers credit deteriorates Early termination of its Agreement with the dealer however may only further a customers growing liquidity crisis Upon early termination a customer that is outofthemoney on its trades with the dealer may end up having to make large termination payments Depending on its agreements with other dealers an early termination could possibly give other dealers the right to terminate their agreements with the customer Even if the customer is in the money it may not be able to replace important terminated hedging transactions Termination of the Agreement may be the beginning of the end for a customer in economic difficulty Cross Default One of the most important signs of a customers financial deterioration for a dealer is the occurrence of a cross default by the customer with one of its other creditors Under the Agreement a cross default takes place upon the occurrence or existence of an event of default with respect to specified indebtedness For the provision to apply however the parties must affirmatively elect for the cross default provision to apply to either or both parties The parties must also agree on the definition of specified indebtedness Specified indebtedness is defined in the Agreement to be any obligation whether present or future contingent or otherwise as principal or surety or otherwise in respect of borrowed money Dealers often will want to expand the definition beyond the concept of borrowed money to include obligations under other types of financial transactions such as forwards repurchase agreements securities lending agreements or even exchange derivatives such as futures and options Dealers may even try to define it to include any contractual obligations of the customer The broader the definition of specified indebtedness the more likely that a cross default will occur to the customer In addition many of the new types of obligations added to the definition of specified indebtedness such as repos are prone to technical defaults Although these technical defaults are generally cured or waived in the ordinary course of business they could provide an aggressive dealer with an opportunity to terminate the Agreement upon their occurrence The parties must also agree on appropriate cross default thresholds This is the amount that a default must exceed before it will constitute a cross default Although the dealer will want a threshold of of its equity for itself it will insist on a more modest number for the customer ranging from million The smaller the threshold the more likely that a cross default will occur to the customer In addition as with all cross default provisions the customer should be careful that the agreed upon threshold amount not be lower than its cross default threshold in its other finance agreements For example if the threshold were lower in the Agreement than the threshold under its loan agreement a small payment default on specified indebtedness might trigger the cross default under the Agreement which in turn might inadvertently trigger the cross default under its other finance agreements A customer should insist that a cross default only occur upon the cross acceleration of the other indebtedness as opposed to merely the existence of a default Under the standard cross default language in the Agreement an event of default can occur upon a default under other indebtedness irrespective of whether the other creditor accelerates the specified indebtedness By requiring that the default result in an acceleration of the underlying indebtedness a dealer would not be able to terminate the Agreement until the other creditor actually accelerated the specified indebtedness Dealers generally resist a cross acceleration requirement because it limits their ability to concurrently negotiate with its customer during any workout discussions the customer might be having with another lender For example a creditor could persuade the customer to pledge additional collateral in exchange for not accelerating the indebtedness If the dealer could not declare a cross default under the Agreement at that same time it would not be able to negotiate the same terms with the customer as did the other customers creditors Credit Event Upon Merger A credit event upon merger is a termination event under the Agreement It occurs if a party participates in a merger or enters into a similar type of transaction and the resulting entity is materially weaker after the event The rationale for the provision is that a party may not have entered into the Agreement with the customer that is now materially weaker because of a merger Like the cross default the parties must elect for the credit event upon merger to apply Unfortunately the term materially weaker is not defined in the Agreement The dealer may attempt to define an objective test that would measure when the resulting entity becomes materially weaker For example the resulting entity would be considered materially weaker if its credit rating were materially affected or if it failed designated financial covenants The parties may also want to expand what is meant by a credit event upon merger The dealer may suggest that recapitalizations through the issuance of new forms of stock or debt would constitute a credit event upon merger A customer may want to resist such a definitional change because of the potential restrictions it could pose on its ability to change its capital structure The occurrence of such a change in its capitalization however would still require the resulting entity to be materially weaker to constitute a termination event Additional Termination Events A dealer may insist on adding additional termination events Additional termination events are generally treated under the Agreement similar to events of default If an additional termination event has occurred with respect to a party that party is referred to as the affected party Upon the occurrence of such an event the dealer would have the right to terminate the Agreement at a time precisely when the customer most needs to maintain its liquidity The most common additional termination events negotiated are those that result from a change in the financial condition of the affected party This could be triggered by a credit downgrading or by the failure to maintain a certain level of capital or net worth or a failure to maintain certain financial ratios An additional termination event could also result from a problem unique to the counterparty such as the failure of an Affected Party to maintain a certain legal or regulatory status Failure to notify the nonaffected party of certain events or to deliver certain information could also be an additional termination event Finally if the affected party is dependant on the leadership or direction of certain individuals the resignation or death of such individuals could also result in early termination Son of First Method Designating first method as a method for determining damages upon the termination of the Agreement has become obsolete The effect of first method was to deprive the defaulting party of any payments upon the termination of the Agreement in the event that the defaulting party was in the money Now however dealers are often insisting on the right to delay making payments to a customer upon an early termination of the Agreement until the dealer is completely satisfied that the defaulting party has no further payment obligations to it something that could takes days or even weeks to resolve Delaying payments on an early termination date however can result in significant liquidity problems for a customer Upon an early termination of the Agreement if the customer is in the money it is probable that a customer may be counting on the dealers payment in order to meet any obligations it has on the early termination date to other parties If such payments were withheld by the dealer the customer would be unable to use such amounts to meet its obligations with other counterparties perhaps triggering additional defaults under other agreements for the customer Limiting Cure Periods The Agreement was drafted by ISDA with cure periods much more liberal than may be typically seen in other finance contracts due to what drafters viewed as the unique characteristics of the OTC derivatives market Dealers however have begun to limit these cure periods For example instead of permitting a customer three business days to cure a payment default the dealers are narrowing it to one Similarly dealers are requesting only a fiveday cure period for breach of certain other provisions while the agreement normally provides for Narrowing of such cure periods may not be in a customers best interest These more limited cure periods are probably not sufficiently long for a customer experiencing economic difficulties to resolve the underlying defaults Although there are numerous legal issues affecting the ISDA Master Agreement that are negotiated the most probable issues that may affect a smaller customer deal with terminating the agreement upon the occurrence of some financial difficulty Because of that the customer should focus its efforts on limiting as much as possible these early termination opportunities Deregulation fails to deliver Financial Times April By Geoff Dyer The lights are not blazing at the presidential palace in the Brasilia nighttime as they once did It is not because the staff are taking it easy however The economy measure is aimed simply at saving energy This is more than just a symbolic gesture Since the beginning of April all government offices from that of the lowest bureaucrat to huge those in stateowned corporations have been under orders to cut energy consumption by per cent Private sector companies and ordinary households are also being urged to trim their energy usage before the lights go out involuntarily The saving measures are Brazils lastditch attempt to stave off a fullblown energy crisis and has prompted many comparisons with the partial deregulation disaster in California Yet even with these cutbacks ministers have already admitted that Brazil will need some form of energy rationing later in the year to avoid the risk of serious blackouts The official culprit for the energy shortage is the weather Patchy rainfall has left the reservoirs in the industrialised southeast of the country only a third full when they should normally be at half their capacity at this time of year Given that more than per cent of Brazils energy comes from hydroelectric plants this presents a serious problem Behind the unreliable weather however lies a generation of underinvestment The debt crisis in the early s cut off foreign financing for the sector while the fiscal problems that came with rampant inflation in the late s and early s constrained the states ability to invest Liberalisation and privatisation during the past six years have not resolved the problem In the period to according to the National Development Bank BNDES growth in generating capacity was per cent a year while electricity consumption expanded annually by per cent Like California the deregulation of the Brazilian energy sector has been a halfway house that has pleased neither supporters or critics While most of the electricity distribution companies have been sold off to the likes of AES of the US and Spains Endesa the bulk of generation capacity where most of the new investment is needed remains in public hands Political disputes have led to the persistent postponement of plans to sell Furnas in the southeast and Chesf in the northeast Meanwhile the governments fiscal austerity drive agreed with and painstakingly monitored by the International Monetary Fund has tied its hands from making the necessary new investments The regulatory environment has also been heavily criticised The government had been hoping to encourage a boom in gaspowered plants especially using the BoliviaBrazil gas pipeline which was opened in However the new thermal plants have come on stream more slowly than expected partly because wouldbe investors were worried about having to pay for the gas in dollars while their revenues would be in reals Neither has the government induced the investments in transmission networks that might have alleviated the situation The south of the country has actually experienced normal rainfall this year However as Sandra Boente an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney noted in a recent report Unfortunately there is not enough transmission capacity to shift that excess power supply to the consumption centres in the southeast At least businesses cannot claim to have been surprised by the potential energy crisis Industry groups have been warning their members for several years not to believe government pledges that there would be no rationing As a result a some companies have invested heavily to create their own generation facilities Ambev the largest brewer in Latin America is spending RDollars m on different gasfired power plants at its factories with a total capacity of MW which it hopes to have in operation by the end of next year The plants will cover twothirds of its energy needs and also save up to per cent on its production costs Another government tactic has been to lean on Petrobras the stateowned oil and gas giant to take part in more thermoelectric plant projects The company has been authorised to invest in a further two plants with capacity of more than MW which takes the total number of plants in which it is involved to Yet it is Petrobras which has also contributed to the growing sense of unease about both the countrys energy sector and the governments liberalisation policies The sinking of the worlds largest offshore oil production platform off the coast of Rio de Janeiro in March was a huge blow to national selfesteem President Fernando Henrique Cardoso described the event as our Challenger in a reference to the explosion of the US space shuttle The accident followed a string of environmental disasters at Petrobras operations including a massive oil spill in Rios Guanabara Bay which endangered some of the citys beaches And while the oil rig was staffed by employees of the company many of the accidents have occurred at facilities where the operations have been outsourced to thirdparty companies In the public eye at least the result has been to tarnish the deregulation of the sector which has seen Petrobras lose its monopoly on exploration and production of oil and a new management team try to make the company more transparent and efficient The newlook Petrobras has been winning supporters among the financial community however with record profits last year of RDollars bn the largest ever by a Brazilian company These stemmed not just from the high oil price but also from streamlined operations and increased production Merchant Banking Capital Proposal Draws a Chorus of Industry Criticism BNA April By Richard Cowden After opposing a March proposal to impose percent capital charges on merchant banking activities several banking organizations now are making the case that such charges are unnecessary altogether according to comment letters on a new proposal The Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Jan jointly issued the proposal to establish a rule governing capital requirements for merchant banking activities approved by the GrammLeachBliley Act Under the agencies proposed sliding scale a financial holding company making equity investments in nonfinancial companies that account for less than percent of its Tier I capital would be subject to an percent capital charge on such investment Certain exceptions would include investments made through a small business investment company An FHC investing between and percent of its Tier capital in nonfinancial companies would be subject to a percent capital charge and an FHC making such investments accounting for more than percent of its Tier capital would be assessed a percent capital charge DER A Signaling their low expectations that they can fend off a sliding scale of capital requirements in the proposal many respondents addressed their remarks to limiting the eventual rules impact on existing investment banking activities The proposal asked for comments on whether certain kinds of investments made prior to the March the date of the original proposal should be exempted from the rule Writing for the Securities Industry Association James E Reilly chairman of its holding company committee said his organization continues to believe that the Agencies should allow firms to rely fully on internal capital allocation models to control the risks of nonfinancial investment activities In the SIAs view regulators concerns about the reliability of such models can be addressed through supervision and examination as is currently done in connection with capital allocation for market risk Richard Whiting executive director and general counsel of the Financial Services Roundtable echoed that theme In his comment letter he wrote that the January proposal presents an unnecessarily burdensome array of restrictions that are neither mandated by safety and soundness nor in keeping with the language or spirit of the GrammLeachBliley Act Whiting emphasized that the proposed capital requirement was not contemplated by lawmakers when they enacted the GLB Act The Roundtable believes that more than any other provision of the GLB Act the merchant banking restrictions in both proposed and final rules have impeded nonbank firms from becoming FHCs financial holding companies Whiting said In evaluating the merchant banking rules it is important to note that neither the traditional securities industry nor the venture capital and private equity investment industries seem to have overcome their aversion to FHC status under the GLB Act That comment reflected the sentiments of many in the financial services sector that the capital rules will undercut the benefit of winning permission for depository institutions to participate in merchant banking one of the centerpiece provisions of the GLB Act Beth Climo executive director of the American Bankers Association Securities Association wrote in a comment letter that her group remains concerned that any special capital charge assessed against FHCs engaged in merchant banking activities will further exacerbate the inequities between FHCs and nonFHCs engaged in merchant banking activities Federal regulators have acknowledged the industrys concerns in this regard In his April testimony before two subcommittees of the House Committee on Financial Services Federal Reserve Governor Laurence H Meyer said the proposed capital requirements would be a bridge to an eventual approach that would use the FHCs internal models Reilly wrote SIA recommends that if the Agencies determine to adopt their capital proposal the final rule should contain a sunset provision or at minimum a specific date by which the Agencies will formally reexamine and reevaluate the need for the capital haircuts Exemptions for SBICs The capital proposal would exempt FHC investments in Small Business Investment Companies up to percent of Tier capital SBICs are licensed and regulated by the Small Business Administration and provide equity financing longterm credit and technical support to small companies Despite this special exception the proposed rule would include investments in an SBIC toward the overall amount that would be considered in determining the capital charge level to which the FHC would be subject Groups representing both large and small financial institutions criticized this provision Charlotte M Bahin director of regulatory affairs and senior regulatory counsel for Americas Community Bankers wrote Imposing higher capital charges on such investment activities by banking organizations may well have a negative impact on this important source of capital Whiting wrote If it is concluded that no special capital charge is appropriate for SBIC investments we see no reason to conclude that a nonSBIC investment should have a higher capital charge because there is a certain level of SBIC investments Many commenters also voiced concerns that under the proposal a series of other kinds of equity investments that had been authorized before passage of the GLB Act also would count toward the total used in determining whether an FHC exceeded the percent or percent thresholds Those investment types would include noncontrolling equity investments made under sections c and c of the Bank Holding Company Act portfolio equity investments made under Regulation K and most equity investments by statechartered banks under section of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act Grandfathered The proposal would make existing permissible investments such as those in SBICs subject to the capital charge rule as of March the date of publication of the original proposed rule That provision also drew strong criticism Reilly wrote Imposing a capital charge on these investments without any evidence that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk would penalize institutions for engaging in long permissible activities SIA respectfully submits that imposing a capital charge retroactively is akin to altering the rules in the middle of the game and doing so could have adverse consequences Reilly also suggested that such investments should be grandfathered not only from the March date but from the date on which the agencies issue the final capital rule Mixed Activities Whiting addressed a feature of the proposal that he said could result in inequities for FHCs that invest in companies whose operations involve a mixture of activities In some cases the firm in which the investment is made may engage in activities that are clearly permissible under the Bank Holding Company Act because they are incidental and complementary to financial activities while there may be questions about the permissibility of other activities he said Under the proposed rules if an FHC invested in such a company Whiting wrote it would have to do so under its merchant banking authority and might have to wait for the Federal Reserve Board to rule on the permissibility question Read literally he wrote the special capital charge would apply to the entire investment in a company even if its financial and incidental activities represented percent of its total revenues and assets We believe that such a result is illogical and inequitable Whiting suggested this matter could be dealt with by applying the capital charge only to the amount of the investment that equals the portion of the companys revenues that are not attributable to permissible activities Euro swap spreads seen sideways US to narrow Reuters April By Nigel Stephenson LONDON April Reuters Swap spreads have tightened markedly in recent weeks as rate cut expectations have seen bond yield curves steepen but analysts say that while dollar spreads could narrow further euros could steady or even widen The year US dollar swap spread has narrowed since the beginning of the year when the Federal Reserve embarked on a series of aggressive interest rate cuts to basis points on Monday from on December Swap spreads are going to come in the US because we still have a very aggressive rate cut priced in said Meyrick Chapman derivatives analyst at UBS Warburg Eurozone swap spreads also narrowed in January but then moved out and sideways until late March The year euro spread narrowed to basis points on Friday close to oneyear lows from on March It stood at on Monday In Europe the expectation of cuts has brought in swap spreads but we are not getting any rate cuts right now and that is one of the reasons we might move sideways Chapman said His target was for the year dollar swap spread to hit basis points in six months The year euro swap spread would narrow to just or Swap spreads the difference between the swap rate and the government bond yield at any maturity are gaining importance as a measure of bond performance and of risk appetite A prime driver of the dollar swap spread has been the rapid steepening of the yield curve The year Treasury spread has steepened to more than basis points from at the beginning of this year Chapman said the year spread could widen to having a further positive impact on swap spreads Jim Reid credit strategist at Barclays Capital also said dollar swap spreads could narrow further to the low to mids over three months SPREADS HELD BACK BY EMERGIBG MARKETS EQUITIES He said that while they were driven inwards by rate cuts they had been held back by concern over emerging markets and equities which often see credit underperform If there is any stability in equity markets and any emerging markets positive news flow you are going to get swap spreads performing in dollars He saw the year euro swap spread moving out to or basis points over three months With any lowering of interest rates in the euro zone expected to be modest in comparison with the easing seen in the US analysts said European Central Bank cuts would not have a major impact on swap spreads It is already pricing in probably a more aggressive rate cut than you could possibly see for the next three months Reid said The risk reward is definitely for euro swap spreads to widen from here he added Jose Sarafana strategist at WestLB in Duesseldorf said that after the recent significant narrowing eurozone swap spreads could be ready for a correction He recommended last week that investors consider switching into German government bonds from peripheral eurozone bonds which would underperform as swap spreads widened However longerterm fundamentals supported a further narrowing of spreads He saw the year at by yearend The economy is slowing governments have to issue more debt than expected and this should increase the supply So we should see some underperformance of government bonds versus credits Further steepening of the US bond yield curve should see the year dollar swap spread at basis points by yearend Sarafana said Feds Greenspans speech to Bond Market Assn Reuters April WASHINGTON April Reuters The following is a the full text of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspans speech delivered in Washington Friday on The Paydown of Federal Debt to the Bond Market Association in White Sulfur Springs WVa I am pleased to be with you this morning and note the Bond Market Associations twentyfifth anniversary Over the years I have enjoyed being associated with many of you in this audience My very best wishes to Heather Ruth on the last day of her tenure as president and congratulations to Micah Green upon his appointment Today I want to address a subject in which your group and the Federal Reserve share a keen interestthe paydown of the federal debt and its implications for the economy and financial markets While the magnitudes of future federal unified budget surpluses are uncertain they are highly likely to remain sizable for some time The dramatic improvement in projections of the budget balance in recent years reflects in large part the pickup in underlying productivity growth in the US economy which has boosted corporate profits and household incomes and thereby tax receipts In effect we built a tax structure on the assumption that the economy would grow over time at rates around those seen from the early s to the mids and this structure has generated considerably more revenue as the economys underlying growth rate has risen Restraint on expenditures also has contributed to the brighter outlook Tight limits on spending were imposed in response to the large deficits of the s and early s and defense spending was reduced following the end of the Cold War Both the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office have assumed that much of the accelerated productivity growth of the late s is likely to be sustained through the next decade No doubt a period of weakness in measured productivity is likely to accompany the current slowdown in economic activity However there is little in the recent data to suggest that any significant alterations in these agencies longerterm projections of structural productivity growth might be required Should we infer from these positive budget developments that unified budget deficits are no longer conceivable Hardly The substantial surpluses in retirement programs especially social security in recent years and in the nearerterm budget projections are on a cash basis Were we fully accruing the benefit liabilities inferable from existing law these retirement programs would currently be in deficit and contingent liabilities amounting to about trillion for social security alone would have been added to the current debt to the public When the baby boom generation retires and as the population subsequently ages further these contingent liabilities will come due andbarring an offsetting surplus in the remainder of the governments budgetwill be met by the issuance of Treasury securities shifting much of total federal liabilities from contingent liability to debt to the public At that point of course the unified budget will be in deficit Of more relevance for the nearer term current forecasts suggest that under a reasonably wide variety of possible tax and spending policies the resulting surpluses will allow the Treasury debt held by the public to be paid off Moreover well before the debt is eliminatedindeed possibly within a relatively few yearsit may become difficult to further reduce outstanding debt to the public because the remaining obligations will mostly consist of savings bonds wellentrenched holdings of longterm marketable debt and perhaps other types of debt that could prove difficult to reduce Whether economic developments and tax and budget choices will in the end produce surpluses of the order of magnitude currently projected is open to debate But the probability of substantial continuing surpluses is sufficiently high to require that at a minimum we begin to address their potential implications for fiscal policy decisionmakers financial markets and the Federal Reserve I have long argued that paying down the national debt is beneficial for the economy It keeps interest rates lower than they otherwise would be and frees savings to finance increases in the capital stock thereby boosting productivity and real incomes But the current budget projections are such that we need to consider what path of debt reduction is best for the economy The issue is complicated On the one hand higher national saving by raising the nations capital stock leaves the country better prepared to cope with the economic effects of the aging of the US populationand one way to achieve that higher saving is to run budget surpluses On the other hand after a point this increase in national saving comes at a cost Once Treasury debt reaches itsirreducible minimum additional surpluses will of necessity lead to the accumulation of substantial privatethat is to say nonfederalassets either in the Treasurys general fund or in government trust funds The decisions on how such funds should be invested by the government would necessarily be political ones and would lead to efforts by some groups to obtain via the political process funding that they could not obtain at least at the same price in private markets These efforts would likely result in distortions in the allocation of capital that must be balanced against the benefit to the nation of the increase in saving In fact it is the marketdriven allocation of capital and labor to their most productive uses that has fostered our recent impressive gains in productivity and encouraged inflows of capital that have enabled us to build an extraordinarily efficient capital stock despite quite modest levels of domestic savings The effectiveness of our markets in allocating capital is one of our nations most valuable assets We need to be careful not to impair their functioning It is regrettably too easy to envision political pressure being exerted to use government financing of investments to offset perceived capital market imperfections Experience suggests that in such cases the resulting returns earned on the investments are likely to fall short of market standards Moreover the social benefits of investment are likely to be very difficult to measure in practice opening the door to political interference in the allocation of funds It is difficult for example to envision effective constraints being placed on politically attractive investments by definedbenefit trust funds such as the social security trust fund Benefits are guaranteed by government irrespective of any losses to the fund Thus one must presume that even if our social security trust funds were to be so seriously impaired by mismanaged government investment that they dried up full benefits would be highly likely to be forthcoming despite the fact that under current law the social security trust fund has limited borrowing authority As a result prospective beneficiaries would have no incentive to police the investment policies of the trust fund To be sure we do have about trillion of assets administered in the definedbenefit plans of state and local governments While research in this area has been limited it does indicate that state and local pension funds have tended to underperform private pension funds if required to direct a portion of their investment within the state or to make economically targeted investments Some recent work has suggested that the negative effects of such requirements may have been less important in recent years than they were in the past but that conclusion remains speculative Along the same lines there is some evidence suggesting that returns on state pension funds have been lower where the proportion of trustees who are political appointees is higher Some have argued that methods could be devised to insulate government investment decisions from the political process even in definedbenefit funds perhaps by limiting such investments to index funds Even if such methods were successful the government would be investing only in publicly traded securities and so its investment might have an adverse effect on the relative financing costs of smaller often quite productive nonpubliclytraded firms Over time these effects would presumably be arbitraged away But such a process likely takes time and capital market imperfections in any event are likely to impede full arbitrage Arguably definedcontribution funds even if administered by a federal agency could insulate investment policy from political interference as well as potentially freeing investment from the straightjacket of holding only index funds It is highly unlikely that the beneficiaries of such funds would countenance politically convenient investments in their retirement funds Indeed the billion federally managed Thrift Savings Fund has been operated without such interference I should note however that conversion of social security from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan would fundamentally alter its nature One way to employ unified budget surpluses to finance increased investment would be to convert such funds into individual retirement accounts owned and administered by beneficiaries with the presumption that the funds would be fully dedicated to retirement In such an instance the resulting reduction in government saving would be offset by a rise in private saving so that total domestic saving would be maintained though the availability of newly owned private assets could reduce the propensity to save out of income somewhat Given concerns about the potential distorting effects of asset accumulation by the Treasury or in government definedbenefit plans we need to carefully consider the appropriate path of debt paydowns By addressing this issue now we can avoid an abrupt and potentially disruptive change in fiscal policy as the level of Treasury debt reaches its irreducible minimum Despite the clear advantages of paying down the federal debt I recognize that doing so has some potential adverse consequences even before the difficulties associated with government accumulation of private assets arise The Treasury market serves a number of useful purposes in addition to providing many of you with profitable employment Most obviously Treasury debt provides an asset that is free of credit risk a characteristic that is desirable for many investors especially in times of economic or financial turbulence Treasury yields also provide a benchmark for the quoting and pricing of risky debt In addition the size and liquidity of the Treasury market allow market participants to hedge interest rate risks easily and at low cost Moreover the liquidity of these securities enables participants to make rapid adjustments to their portfolios in times of market volatility Thus the elimination of Treasury debt does remove something of economic value and it will require that significant adjustments be made by market participants Indeed with marketable Treasury debt held by the publicthat is excluding the Federal Reserve but including foreign central bankshaving declined about percent in recent years to less than trillion some of these adjustments have already begun Reportedly firms have increasingly turned to swaps agency securities and even larger corporate debt issues to do their hedging After a period of transition such shifts arguably should not have any significant adverse effect on risk management As hedging activity moves from the shrinking Treasury market to alternative markets the liquidity of those markets should improve Yields on the alternative hedging instruments likely will track at least as closely with those on instruments commonly being hedged as do Treasury yields Similarly the loss of Treasury securities as benchmarks seems unlikely to result in major difficulties for market participants because alternative benchmarks are easy to envision For example in European bond markets swaps are already the most common benchmark Even in the United States the Treasury bill market has lost its benchmark status in recent years and has been replaced in that role by the eurodollar and eurodollar futures markets with no evident adverse effects on the operation of shortterm credit markets All of these alternative assets of course involve some degree of credit risk However given sufficient demand it seems likely to me that you or your colleagues could produce a nearly riskless security For example this could be accomplished with a very senior tranche of a collateralized debt obligation backed by highgrade corporate debt In short I am confident that US financial markets which are the most innovative and efficient in the world can readily adapt to a paydown of Treasury debt by creating private alternatives with many of the attributes that market participants value in Treasury securities Of course the resulting adjustments will not be perfect and in some cases will impose costs on financial market participants especially during the period of transition to new products and procedures However I believe that these costs are very likely to be outweighed by the benefits to the country of a higher capital stock and the resulting increases in productivity and income that appear to be the consequence of debt reduction Moreover competitive pressures and profit opportunities will provide a strong incentive for you and your colleagues in the financial industry to devise ways to minimize such costs Still the lack of Treasury securities might be a bigger problem for international investors than for domestic investors because they may be less well informed about US corporations As a result international investorsespecially official onesmay have a strong preference for US government instruments In such circumstances foreign investors may reduce on net their holdings of overall dollar assets as Treasury securities are paid down By itself such diminution in the demand for US dollar assets would tend to raise interest rates for US borrowers and conceivably put downward pressure on the dollars exchange rate However the evidence of the past year and a half gives little support to this notion Foreign private investors on net have run off their holdings of US Treasury securities while they have built up their holdings of private dollar assets by an even larger amount and the foreign exchange value of the dollar has appreciated A final valuable feature of the Treasury market is that it is a remarkably efficient system for funding federal government deficits Because demographic and other factors are surely likely to lead to the reemergence of deficits in the future one might argue that it would be best to continue to borrow at least limited amounts from time to time in order to keep the market operating so that it will be available when it is needed again While that is clearly an alternative we should also keep in mind that reestablishing the Treasury security market likely would not be all that difficult Borrowing needs in all likelihood would start out small so the market would have time to develop Moreover I have great confidence in your abilityor that of your successorsto initiate a new market for Treasury debt when that becomes necessary Like other financial market participants the Federal Reserve will also have to adjust to the loss of Treasury debt Currently Treasury securities are the permanent assets that correspond to the currency that is the Federal Reserves main liability Treasury securities have several features that make them particularly attractive assets for the Federal Reserve First the liquidity of the market allows the Federal Reserve to make substantial changes in reserves in a short period of time if necessary Second the size of the market has meant that the effects of the Federal Reserves purchases on the prices of Treasury securities have been minimal Third Treasury securities are free of credit risk Thus the Federal Reserve does not itself take on such risk when it holds them I should point out that we do not eschew risk because we fear becoming insolvent Rather we believe that the effects of Federal Reserve operations on the allocation of private capital are likely to be minimized when Federal Reserve intermediation involves primarily the substitution in the publics portfolio of one type of instrument that is free of credit risk currencyfor anotherTreasury securities As I discussed earlier it is important that government holdings of assets not distort the private allocation of capital and this goal applies to the Federal Reserve System as well as to the Treasury However if the Treasury debt is paid down as I trust it will be then the Federal Reserve will have to find alternative assets that still provide substantial liquidity and minimize distortions to the private allocation of capital Even before that time the Treasury market may become less liquid making it more difficult for the Fed to make purchases without affecting market prices Moreover declining Treasury debt presumably would at some point reduce the liquidity of the Treasury repurchase agreement RP market complicating the use of such operations in adjusting the shortterm supply of reserves In the short run the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase a substantial volume of Treasury securities In order to minimize the effects of its purchases on the market however it has established limits on the fraction of individual issues that it will hold going forward The Federal Open Market Committee FOMC as you know has also decided on a temporary basis to allow the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct RP operations with agency mortgagebacked securities as collateral as well as with Treasuries and direct agency debt Other changes that are already allowed under current statutes could be implemented to substitute to a limited extent for our holdings of Treasury securities For example the Federal Reserve could purchase outright Ginnie Mae securities which are fully backed by the Treasury It could also further broaden the types of collateral allowed for RP operations perhaps including certain municipal obligations or those of foreign governments Such an expansion could reduce the effects of Federal Reserve operations in the market for any particular type of collateral The FOMC has asked staff to explore all of these shortrun alternatives Over a longer time horizon more fundamental changes could be considered One possibility is to expand the use of the discount window by auctioning such credit to financially sound depository institutions Such auctions would enhance our ability to adjust the supply of reserves as needed and because these loans would be fully collateralized they would offer considerable protection against credit risk Another possibility is to add new assets to those the Fed is currently allowed by law to buy for its portfolio These assets could be used to provide a broader range of RP collateral a process similar in concept to the expanded use of the discount window as well as ultimately being added to our permanent portfolio One would hope that such additions would help to limit the distortions to particular markets caused by Federal Reserve purchases Of course what adjustments we make to our proceduresand when we make themdepend on how rapidly the supply of Treasury securities dwindles and on how long the Treasury market is not available As I noted earlier demographic forces are likely to cause unified budget deficits to reemerge at some point in the future and fresh supplies of Treasury securities to be issued At that time the Federal Reserve presumably would begin to shift our portfolio back toward the Treasury market The timing and extent of the reemergence of Treasury issuance will depend on underlying productivity growth and of course on the degree of fiscal discipline exercised by future American governments Finally in the period ahead the Federal Reserve will be seeking active consultations and discussions with you and other market participants as well as with the Congress before significant changes are made to Federal Reserve procedures and methods While the prospective paydown of Treasury debt presents us with challenges I am confident that with your help the Federal Reserve can make the needed adjustments and will be able to continue to implement monetary policy in the national interest The benefits of reducing our federal debt make the associated challenges well worth meeting Enron Offers Structured Weather Note

Implement Broad Risk Standard In Hedging Regulations Witnesses to Urge BNA May By Alison Bennett Proposed rules REG on hedging transactions do not go far enough in implementing a new risk management standard enacted by Congress several witnesses are expected to tell the Internal Revenue Service May Issued in January the rules are intended to reflect changes under the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of Pub L No for businesses entering hedging transactions DTR G L That law changed the standard for qualifying hedging transactions from one focusing on risk reduction transactions to one centered around risk management transactions Several witnesses are expected to tell IRS officials at a hearing that the proposed rules fall short of what Congress intended in implementing the new broader standard Broad Standard Favored Andrea Kramer McDermott Will Emery Chicago is expected to testify that while the government did try to incorporate the new risk management standard into the rules its efforts did not go far enough While the proposed regulations generally define a hedging transaction in terms of the required risk management standard many of the operative provisions revert back to the risk reduction standard of the current regulations Kramer said in written comments to IRS Kramer said she objected to statements in the rules that a transaction that is not entered into to reduce a taxpayers risk does not manage risk and others that she said would if adopted as final regulations effectively negate the statutory changes Congress thought it was making The McDermott Will Emery practitioner is expected to contend the final regulations must be conformed throughout to replace the concept of risk reduction with that of risk management In addition she will urge IRS to provide examples of modern risk management activities that would constitute qualifying hedging transactions Commodities Rule Requested Earl Goldhammer representing Americas Energy Partner is expected to make similar points at the hearing In an outline submitted to IRS Goldhammer said the final rules should allow hedging treatment for certain commodities derivatives transactions entered into in the normal course of business by commodities dealers According to the outline qualifying transactions should relate to a derivative valued in reference to a commodity also handled by the dealer fall within preapproved controls on speculation set out in formally adopted risk management policies and not be identified by the commodities dealer as having been entered into in its dealer capacity This proposal recognizes the existence of appropriate and inevitable differences between each dealer in commodities as to its risk tolerances and risk management techniques he said Weather Energy Derivatives Salomon Smith Barney Tax Director Mark Perwien representing the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc New York also is likely to criticize the references to risk reduction found under the proposed rules To properly implement congressional intent Perwien said in an outline of his testimony the proposed rules should extend hedging transaction status to all transactions undertaken in the ordinary course of business that alter the taxpayers exposure to one or more of the risks inherent in the taxpayers core economic activities Perwien also is expected to urge IRS to provide hedge transaction status to weather and energy supply derivatives Likewise he said in the outline the service should permit hedges of dividend streams overall profitability and other business risks that do not relate directly to interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations Insurance Concerns Mark Canter representing the American Council of Life Insurers Washington DC will bring specific industry concerns to the hearing Canter is likely to assert that life insurers utilization of gap hedging transactions should be allowed hedging treatment because they are entered into in the normal course of business to manage risk with respect to interest rate changes Without a change to the proposed rules gap hedges of life insurers may be inappropriately denied hedging treatment solely because of an unworkable test in the preamble that requires them to be more closely associated with liabilities than assets Canter said in an outline of his oral comments The fifth and final witness Linda Carlisle of White Case LLP Washington DC is expected to ask IRS to extend hedging treatment to risk management transactions for services income derived from converting one commodity into another Testifying on behalf of the Interstate Natural Gas Association Carlisle also will urge the agency to clarify that weather derivatives may hedge price risks EMBBIS data show OTC derivatives activity slowed in H Reuters May BASEL Switzerland May Reuters Growth in the huge market for overthecounter derivatives slowed in the second half of with volume of outstanding contracts rising just one percent from the end of June the Bank for International Settlements BIS said on Tuesday Growth in the first half had been nearly seven percent The BIS bases its estimates on the notional amount of outstanding OTC contracts which totaled trillion at the end of December Notional value reflects the size of the underlying transactions on which the derivatives instruments are based The interest rate derivatives segment the single largest in terms of OTC traded instruments had a notional value of trillion at end percent of the total market Swaps are the single largest category in the interest rate category amounting to trillion at the end of December In the specific case of the interest rate swap market the deceleration in growth was in sharp contrast to the very rapid pace of business seen since the end of the BIS said Eurodenominated contracts accounted for trillion or nearly onethird of the total volume of interest rate derivatives outstanding at the end of A seven percent drop in eurodenominated interest rate contracts was a major factor behind slower growth in the second half the BIS said The BIS cited financial sector consolidation reduced issuance of some types of domestic securities including German Pfandbriefe which are often hedged with swaps and belated efforts by banks to clean up their preeuro legacy currency portfolios as likely factors behind the drop Counterparties most affected by this were interdealer brokers the BIS added Meanwhile volume in dollardenominated interest rate swaps remained buoyant That market second behind

market value The largest absolute increase here was seen in foreign exchange contracts which rose by billion in the final six months of The BIS gave no reason for the large increase in the gross market value relative to notional amounts which rose to trillion for currency instruments also up one percent Currency activity picked up in the latter part of however while a drop in shortterm

Service May By Nicholas Elliott NEW YORK Dow Jones Singlestock futures have drawbacks that may limit their use according to Philip McBrideJohnson head of exchangetraded derivatives at law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher Flom and a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission McBrideJohnson was speaking at the Third Annual Derivatives Expo Tuesday He pointed out that because singlestock futures which were legalized under the Commodity Futures Modernization Act passed last December will be regulated by both the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission the costs of regulation will be higher than for other futures or for options on stocks For current users of options on stocks McBrideJohnson noted that futures on stocks entail a higher cost in margin payments plus a standard fee paid by options users to the SEC McBrideJohnson added that of the international exchanges that list futures on stocks and options on stocks the volume of options traded is times larger than on the futures He pointed out that the new law prohibits options on singlestock futures for at least three years another limit on the appeal of such futures McBrideJohnson stressed that he

market got a partial reprieve last month from an onerous provision in the US Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB new derivatives accounting standard FAS requires companies to report option premium volatility due to time value changes theta in their earnings Endusers say this causes earnings volatility that many of them cannot tolerate and which they argue makes no sense to report if they plan to hold the hedge to maturity Endusers are currently scaling back their use of complex options and swaptions in favour of simpler hedging tools that qualify for FAS s hedge accounting which allows endusers to avoid reporting the effective portion of a hedges fair value fluctuations in earnings Indeed of endusers in a recent survey of about US corporations and asset mangers by Greenwich Associates a Greenwich Connecticutbased research firm said FAS would cause them to reduce their use of interest rate options with saying it would force a significant reduction A handful of highprofile US derivatives endusers led by home mortgage securitisation giant Fannie Mae lobbied unsuccessfully for a change in the option provision last year The group proposed that the timevalue component of an options premium be amortised into earnings over its life Rejection The FASB rejected this approach during its comment period for FAS and again last autumn when the group pressed once more for an amendment Risk October page After the years of controversy leading up to FAS s passage the board is loath to reopen the standard for amendments Rather the FASBs derivatives implementation group DIG a task force of accountants and derivatives industry members that churns out advice on how to implement FAS has devised a guideline that skirts the need for an amendment We are not amortising time value as was proposed last year in one of the amendments says Timothy Lucas director of research and technical activities at FASB and chairman of the DIG There will definitely be no amendment he says The implementation guideline is no panacea Essentially the DIG has proposed that all changes in an options fair value be recorded under other comprehensive income OCI a part of a companys equity account until the date that the hedged transaction affects earnings Then the fair value of the hedge should offset the fair value of the exposure But the option must match the underlying exactly it must pass all FAS s effectiveness test requirements It must match the timing of the underlying cashflow and there must be no basis risk FASB put the proposal out for a fiveweek comment period on April Fannie Mae and other endusers say they are scrutinising it and expect to submit comments this month The FSAs hardliner Risk May By Matthew Crabbe Is there a schism between the New York Federal Reserve Bank and the UKs Financial Services Authority FSA A speech delivered by William McDonough president of the New York Fed and chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to the annual meeting of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association in Washington last month seemed to offer the prospect of a cut in the w charge a capital floor on credit derivative positions or even its full removal The Basel Committee may have confused legal risk with op risk in its conception of the charge McDonough said It seemed for a while as if the derivatives business might have persuaded the Basel Committee to make an historic Uturn on a charge that ISDA says will damage the credit derivatives business If the w charge is anyones idea it is Oliver Pages Page joined the Bank of England in from Cambridge and worked his way through the statistics division the forex division the international division and then markets supervision He moved with other supervisors to the new FSA in where he became director of financial supervision for complex international groups the largest UK banks Last month that responsibility was expanded to include major insurance companies and the division was renamed the major financial groups division In recent speeches FSA chairman Howard Davies has been hammering home the message that insurance companies should be subject to the same prudential standards of the Basel Accord as banks Page is also chairman of the Basel Committees capital group and one of that groups subgroups covers credit risk mitigation This is the source of the detail of the w charge the w stands for weight it was Pages idea to label it so David Clementi deputy governor of the Bank of England has also been making hawkish noises about the hidden dangers of the credit derivatives business Page says too much has been read into McDonoughs speech This is a consultative paper we are talking about he says The operational risk charge is a concept that still has to be fleshed out Even the internal ratingsbased approach to credit calculations still has to be fleshed out And banks are only just waking up to the message that by October these proposals will be decided But while everything is open to discussion Page insists The w charge is not a mistake We the Basel Committee decided last year that if we could locate capital charges closer to the risks then those charges would be more accurate Speaking at an FSAorganised conference in London the following week McDonough failed to repeat the suggestion that the w charge could be about to go I still think people are reading too much into what they think was said in Washington about the w charge There are some material risks there and this is the solution that people on the Committee signed up for Page says the w charge is not just a kneejerk response to last Septembers loan restructuring by Conseco the US insurer a restructuring that triggered default clauses under ISDAs standard documentation for credit derivatives Even if it were specifically a charge for the legal risk involved in writing credit protection that doesnt mean it should not be charged separately but wrapped up in Basels sweeping charge for operational risks says Page And anyway this is not a pure legal risk charge ISDA tried to get the documentation for credit derivatives right twice and now they are changing it again Thats not about legal risk its about the risk that credit derivatives do not pay out when people expect them to Its about the instability of the documentation As for the op risk charge Page rejects the idea that banks should be able to take out insurance instead Just because its been laid off the risk is not zero he says What is the evidence that insurance companies can lay off the risk somewhere else So there may be differences in opinion among the Basel Committees members but a deal was done And if there are going to be any changes to the proposals for a new Accord they must be decided quickly because the proposals are going to be set in six months time This is a sensitive stage in the global regulatory process the FSA believes The Basel Committees January deadline for the implementation of the new Accord was seen as a concession to European banks and their supervisors by the Fed The FSA has told the EU it must move fast if it wants its Capital Adequacy Directive which parallels Basels New Accord to be ready at the same time The FSA is not just worried that there will be an uneven regulatory playing field for banks with US banks being forced by the supervisors into their own capitalefficient superleague while flabby European banks fall behind It also wants to stamp its authority as the allembracing single regulator for UK financial markets responsible for consumer protection and the safety of the financial system The nod and a wink style of market supervision that the Bank of England perfected over the years has gone replaced by the kind of bold statement favoured by US government agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission Building society use of credit derivatives approved IFR May The UK Treasury last week proposed legislation that would allow building societies to use credit derivatives for risk management purposes UK building societies are already active users of interest rate and currency derivatives and wilt be able to hedge against borrower default if the legislation is passed The UK parliament has Just broken up ahead of the June general election but a change in the law to extend the use of credit derivatives could still K enacted later this year The most active debt issuers and hedgers among building societies have converted from mutual status in recent years With Halifax and Alliance Leicester among those following Abbey National in turning themselves into listed banks There are still building societies in the UK with total assets of more than olbbn however and credit derivatives dealers in London can be exported to start pitching credit protection products to the societies in advance of any actual change in the law Nationwide is the biggest remaining building society in asset terms followed by Britannia and Yorkshire Even assuming that legislation allowing credit derivatives use is passed building societies will not be able to use default swaps to take speculative positions The Building Societies Act of restricts derivatives use to risk management purposes and sets out a list of risk factors where derivatives use is permissible Default swap collapse opens arbitrage window IFR May By Jon Macaskill At least Ebn and possibly as much as Ebn equivalent of creditlinked note issuance has been seen in the last month The resulting offsetting of short credit default swap positions has caused a sharp widening in the negative basis between default swaps and the asset swap value of the underlying debt in the secondary bond market Dealers with access to corporate bonds have been able to buy default swaps at levels as much as bp under the asset swap value of the debt and to create synthetic packages for their clients where in effect the only risk is to the counterparty on the swap Credit derivatives dealers who chanced to be flat have been turning huge profits by proprietary dealing and from sales of these packages to their favoured insurance company customers Deutsche Bank Merrill Lynch Bear Stearns and Citigroup have been among the most aggressive sellers of default swaps in recent weeks according to dealers at rival houses and their crossing of bidoffer spreads has driven the negative default swap basis to bonds ever wider A Ebn creditlinked note issued by Deutsche Bank is typical of the deals that have been fuelling this movement The deal Deutsche Bank Repon offered exposure to separate corporate credits from the US and from Europe Because Deutsche Bank had the deal rated the terms of the issue spread across trading desks in London and New York and rival dealers pulled hack their bids on default swaps in the relevant corporates Other banks were selling similar unrated and therefore private credit linked notes at the same times which led to a scramble to offset swap positions Faced with a shortage of bonds in the secondary market and repo rates at for some corporate issues forced to hit whatever bid was available in the default swap market pushing the negative basis for many investment grade fiveyear default swaps from an bpbp negative basis to a bp bp basis last week This produced wild diversity between default swaps for corporates that had seen their debt used for creditlinked notes and similar companies that had not Lufthansa fiveyear default swaps were offered at bp late last week while British Airways offers in the same maturity were no lower than bp for example Many default swaps were also very low on an absolute basis Single A rated French pharmaceuticals company Aventis was quoted at bpbp for a fiveyear default swap at the close of dealing on Friday for example Other corporate default swaps were also at extremely tight levels with RollsRoyce offered as low as bp in the fiveyear Volkswagen at bp BMW offered at least as low as bp and Unilever at bp Run for the door The movement was not limited to European credits Offsetting of default swaps led to the sale of negative basis packages in US names including Sears Bank of America and Philip Morris with Bank of America trading at levels below bp in the fiveyear or less than half its trade point when fears about US bank credit quality were at their height earlier this year General market sentiment that the worst of the current downturn in credit quality has passed has amplified the effect of the default swap selling Investors are happy to hold corporate bonds which has left dealers struggling to buy paper to cover their positions as tentative to selling default swaps Everyone tried to run for the door at the same time said one head dealer describing trading in recent weeks He predicted that the wide negative basis between swaps and bonds will be a trading feature for some time Dealers worry that the banks which are selling default swaps most aggressively are more synthetic credit linked notes As long as they can maintain a margin between the notes and the level at which they can offset their exposure they will keep hitting swap bids This collision of default swap offset needs a bond shortage and improved credit sentiment is working in favour of corporate treasurers WorldCom managed to sell the biggest deal yet from a US corporate last week and saw spread talk on what proved to be an USbn equivalent deal tighten ahead of pricing An issue of this size would normally prompt a sharp widening in default swaps on the relevant corporate but WorldCom saw its fiveyear mid quotes fall from bp two weeks ago to below lObp last week The decline in default swap quotes and widening basis to asset swap levels for bonds has been restricted to Europe and the US so far If sentiment about the credit quality of Asian corporates improves there could be note issuance and spread movement The dealers who have been struggling to cover their positions in the supposedly liquid US and European bond and swap markets may be reluctant to try the same approach in Asia however With the prospect of more issuance of creditlinked notes on US and European corporates and maintenance of the wide negative swap to bond basis dealers who are allowed to run proprietary positions and their insurance company clients should reap further windfall arbitrage profits The traders forced to offset deals issued by their structured note departments face further weeks of anxious hedging however Lightrade expands pooling points network IFR May The time it takes to deliver bandwidth between New York and Los Angeles will soon get a little shorter Lightrade the neutral pooling point operator is expanding its network of pooling points the high capacity switches that deliver bandwidth between buyers from New York to Los Angeles The pooling centre is under construction at present but plans are under way to complete the connection by the end of June according to Doug Minster vicepresident of corporate development at Lightrade Lightrade formed in November began establishing pooling points or carrier hotels in most major US metropolitan cities to shorten the time it takes to deliver bandwidth and provide the quality of service measurements needed to efficiently connect all parties Beginning with Seattle Lightrade operates its pooling points in cities including Philadelphia Washington Atlanta Miami Chicago Dallas and San Jose The pooling point operator is focusing on deploying seven or eight more pooling point centres throughout the US with San FranciscoDenver and HoustonBoston in progress The company is also investigating opportunities in Europe Energy companies are excited about the prospect of more pooling point expansion as that is one of the catalysts they believe will accelerate bandwidth trading and derivatives use A carrier could bring in a large pipe and split off and give smaller pipes to multiple different entities Minster said As much as of the trading that is occurring now in the bandwidth market is via Lightrade pooling points according to an energy trader The Lightrade active switch equipment that can be controlled from a personal computer is favoured by energy traders over alternative passive cross connect panels that may be cheaper noted another energy trader Mike Pardun vicepresident marketing and development at Colocom a neutral colocation provider that offers facilities and power to carriers and service providers including Lightrade agreed that telecoms traders have a particular need for multiple pooling point operators The Holy Grail of bandwidth trading only becomes a reality when true multicarrier bandwidth on demand is enabled by seamlessly traversing multiple pooling points said Pardun As a neutral operator Lightrade does not own any fibre just the switches that facilitate the faster buying and selling of bandwidth It does not get involved in any actual trading but charges a port fee to connect to its equipment and a delivery fee Though Enron El Paso and Williams Communications all operate pooling points of their own Lightrade is not in direct competition with them There is a natural disinclination for other energy companies to want to do business with them since they are not a neutral body Some companies like Enron also use Lightrade pooling points Other carriers however do not have a compelling incentive to interconnect with Lightrade as they often prefer to avoid the pooling point middleman and swap bandwidth among themselves Some opposition to Lightrade also stems from Lightrades favouring of the trading community over the carriers notes Cobs Pardun He adds that Lightrade and bandwidth traders in general have not yet convinced the carriers that matter that there is revenue to be had that tips the balance away from the perceived threat of the commoditisation of bandwidth Companies that have attempted to have neutral bandwidth trading platforms as well as operate neutral pooling points have had conflicts arise RateXchange the online trading exchange for bandwidth and futures products shut down its neutral pooling points that were deployed globally for that very reason The trading platform is often viewed as competing with online brokers and conflicts existed in cultivating their business through the neutral pooling point according to Nick Coil senior vicepresident of trading operations at RateXchange It was not as much with the energy trading groups but it was still an issue he adds RateXchange has three pooling points in Europe that were shut down last year and still have to be uninstalled Competition could conic from virtual pooling points that perform a similar role as the neutral pooling points but use software instead of deploying a large unit Companies such as Telseon are already breaking ground with the use of highspeed gigabit ethernet services Pooling Points Corporation is also entering this market with the use of a Teletrade Intelligent Platform that uses realtime analysis but it is not expected to be ready until later this year ISDA Finalizes Credit Derivatives Restructuring Document Dow Jones May By Joe Niedzielski NEW YORK Dow Jones The International Swaps and Derivatives Association said Friday that it has finalized and published the restructuring supplement to its ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions The supplement which was previewed in early April at the trade groups annual meeting in Washington DC includes changes to what kind of underlying financial instruments can be delivered in the event of a creditrestructuring event The Supplement represents the consensus of a diverse range of constituents in the credit derivatives markets including portfolio managers credit protection sellers and dealers Robert Pickel ISDAs executive director and CEO said Friday in a press release Credit default swaps are overthecounter derivatives contracts that let investors transfer the default risk on loans or bonds by selling it to a third party for a premium that is derived from the notional amount of the contract The language of these contracts generally allows protection buyers to collect on their default swaps if a debt instrument such as a loan is restructured and the underlying instruments coupon is reduced or its maturity is lengthened Buyers can also usually collect if there is some other type of credit event that would make the loan economically impaired But the restructuring of loans last year made to Conseco Inc CNC created some stir in the market Market participants who had bought default swap protection on the Conseco credit were able to deliver cheap cash bonds to dealers and receive par in exchange Some of the maturities on longerdated bonds that were delivered far outweighed the maturity of the loans Some dealers then decided to remove the restructuring language from the contracts on newly written business Those dealers and others noted that the Conseco example amounted to a cheapest to deliver opportunity that wasnt the initial intent of how these contracts should be settled The primary change that ISDA and its credit derivatives market practice committee announced in April limits the maturity of physical securities that can be delivered if a restructuring event is declared Under the new supplement credit protection buyers would be limited to delivering physical securities with a maturity of less than months following the restructuring date or to the extended maturity of the restructured loan Since the supplement was previewed in April ISDAs credit derivatives market practice committee have worked to finalize several details in the proposal ISDA said These include the definition of an eligible transferee for certain deliverable obligations under a credit derivative transaction ISDA said the full test of the restructuring supplement is available on its web site End of ISDA Press Report for May THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS

Sparks Speculation The Wall Street Journal Europe The inevitability of consolidation Euromoney Long after LTCM hedge funds still pose concerns Reuters EUs single financial market in the balance Financial Times March By Christopher BrownHumes Peter Norman Rapid development of the European Unions planned single market for financial services last night hung on just a few words of text in a draft resolution to be put to EU leaders at their summit in Stockholm which starts today The resolution which would give a big political boost to the recent proposals of Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy to speed secondary legislation on financial services through the EUs decision making machinery met continuing German opposition as finance ministers gathered in a special session of the EUs Ecofin council to try to resolve the issue Before the talks Bosse Ringholm Swedish finance minister and chairman of last nights meeting told the Swedish newspaper Finanstidningen We agree on per cent But Goran Persson the Swedish leader and summit host was more cautious Im not confident at all I will try and try hard he told the press The dispute yesterday provided an inauspicious backdrop to the twoday summit which has been called to inject new life into the EUs ambitious yearold project to turn Europe into the worlds most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy by EU member states the European Commission and the European parliament all acknowledge that rapid development of an integrated EU market for financial services would spur economic growth and employment in the EU Amid widespread concern that national political priorities are causing the EU to fall behind with other important reforms such as the creation of an EUwide patent and the liberalisation of its energy and postal markets Mr Persson yesterday stressed the responsibility of the leaders to make the summit a success We are meeting at a time when the economic business cycle is slowing down and that might have an impact on Europe Our talks on structural reform are more important than ever he said Germanys objections to the draft resolution on the Lamfalussy report surfaced late on Wednesday after EU ambassadors in Brussels came close to agreement on unblocking a dispute in which the Commission and member states were deadlocked over how to share powers with a new EU securities committee The immediate problems concerned differences over the ability of the Commission to adopt technical securities market legislation to be put forward by the securities committee proposed by Mr Lamfalussy against the wishes of some member states As the other states found they could accept compromise proposals to settle the dispute it emerged that Germanys more pressing concern was to protect the interests of Frankfurt as a financial centre against a perceived AngloSaxon bias in the Commission department responsible for financial services Last nights special meeting of the Ecofin council was confirmed after Hans Eichel the German finance minister said the issues needed further deliberation BIS Survey Sparks Speculation The Wall Street Journal Europe March By John Hardy NEW YORK No one doubts the foreignexchange market is the worlds biggest financial market but whether daily turnover remains at trillion trillion euros is the subject of much debate among the markets professionals After a long stretch of steady increases daily turnover may register a decline when the Bank For International Settlements releases results of its latest survey in a few months Every three years the Switzerlandbased BIS carries out a comprehensive survey of worldwide activity in foreignexchange and derivatives markets Data collected this year probably wont be fully available until May However industry participants are debating what the latest results will show Many expect them to be very different from those in the last report in That survey indicated that the foreignexchange market generated daily turnover of about trillion This represented in dollar terms growth of in the three years after the previous survey in April Growth was slowing compared with the increase in the period but was still very robust Now the picture is expected to be far less vigorous Some experts believe the next set of results will show a sharp decline in daily volumes Economists at Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs predict the data will show trading has fallen by as much as to around trillion a day Others see a more muted decline Its not anything that you predict with any certainty but I think itll be down a little bit said David Gilmore a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex Connecticut The inevitability of consolidation Euromoney March By Jonathan Brown It took a while for the internet to have any significant impact on wholesale financial markets While the rest of the global economy was busy diving into the dot corn pool the largest financial institutions especially their fixedincome departments were cooling their heels not wanting to commit themselves too early to the socalled new economy But last year the leading bond market firms finally dived in All the big players have stakes in a wide variety of platforms seeking to ensure a presence as the winners and losers sort themselves Out In the fixedincome markets dozens of platforms have been launched in the past year all promising to provide buyside institutions and issuers with the benefits that electronic trading can bring Its becoming clear that not all will be able to survive in what is a highly competitive arena Broadly the main platforms can be split into two groups multipledealer sites aimed at providing buyers with a range of prices usually in a limited array of products and singledealer multiproduct sites where one dealer offers access to many categories of instruments but with no price comparison An example of the latter is Credit Suisse First Bostons platform Prime Trade Ben Cohen head of fixedincome ecommerce at CSFB feels that the singledealer model has a future but must offer an even greater variety of products in order to have any chance of survival As for the multidealer sites Cohen believes that there is room for several platforms with a maximum of two or three in each category CSFB has taken a position in most of the main ventures in the multidealer field to ensure that the bank will have a say in shaping the market Carry Jones director of sales and marketing at BrokerTec believes that the market will eventually be able to sustain only a few platforms in each area The likely winners will need market sponsorship low costs excellent technology and a broad product range he says BrokerTec meets all of these criteria we started by dealing in governments as these are the most liquid products quickly added basis and repo trading and will soon be expanding into such areas as agencies Pfandbrief and corporates We want to be seen as a system that covers all fixedincome products not just government bonds As these systems multiply and develop traders will want to minimize the number of platforms they have to deal with so the multidealer multiproduct model would appear to be the likely winner Lee Olesky President and CEO of BrokerTec says Traders dont want to have to go to five or six different places to access liquidity Multidealer sites must merge The market is poised to enter a new stage of development when multidealer singleproduct sites will come together For the moment the array of online platforms is bewildering Confusion is apparent among the large banks that have backed many of them as to which they are likely to support Some fixed income heads seem unsure about what investments their firms have made They got involved in the first place because online trading offers great savings in time and costs Whereas previously a trader or investor wishing to buy a particular type of bond would have to spend valuable time on the phone to various dealers searching for the best price now the most advanced platforms offer the facility to compare prices from a group of dealers in a matter of seconds Although individual savings may not seem that much as volumes increase still further the cumulative effect could become substantial To offer the best possible system to users a platform must also have the best technology Cohen says To be successful a platform must offer quick updates of prices reliability and security The platform must always be evolving In order to achieve this a provider must have an efficient technology team

prominent contenders Long after LTCM hedge funds still pose concerns Reuters March BASEL Switzerland March Reuters Top international regulators said this week that more work is needed on reducing risks posed by highlyleveraged institutions like hedge funds A working group of top regulators warned in a study released on Thursday against backsliding on efforts aimed at preventing another nearfailure like the one involving US hedge fund LongTerm Capital Management in The LTCM rescue involved over banks which injected about billion to keep the Connecticut firm from going under Fears that problems could spread through the system prompted the New York Federal Reserve to oversee the private sector rescue New York Fed President William McDonough welcomed the latest report by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions which looks at progress made since these bodies published earlier reports on the same topic in Rather than leaving issues in the air they thought it would be a good thing to have an assessment of the progress made said one source familiar with the report The latest report said banks and securities firms have improved due diligence and monitoring of highlyleveraged institutions HLIs Meanwhile leverage overall has decreased and with the unwinding and restructuring of some big highlyleveraged firms concentration risk has also gone down The latest report cites a need for more work on getting information from leveraged firms These are not always forthcoming partly for fear of competition LTCM for example was regarded by investors as an organisation giving out sparse information on its activities An important aspect of the relationship between HLIs and authorised firms is the timely flow of relevant information between counterparties and the appropriate management of the exposure in light of this information a report summary said This is the area where you need a clear dialogue the source added saying it would be especially useful to glean more information on measures like ValueatRisk VaR which estimates the maximum theoretical potential loss to a trading book over a given time span Another area for work is seen in collecting margins on derivatives positions While margins are common on exchangetraded instruments they are less so in the overthecounter markets Here the report said competition was also a problem While firms have generally been able to strengthen contractual provisions with respect to the HLI sector competitive pressures continue to affect firms ability to insist on the full range of risk mitigants including initial margin the summary said End of ISDA Press Report for March THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA

Euromoney Accounting changes spell m charge for Sears Financial Times Impatience and optimism on clearing Euromoney Basel gives banks the whip hand Euromoney Interest rate swap market opens up Financial Times March By Janaki Ghatpande Till about to months ago the longterm interest rate swap IRS market was dormant for the lack of sufficient benchmarks despite the Reserve Bank of India RBI permitting the instrument as far back as June Ironically in the last few weeks there has been a spurt in IRS deals indicating a development of the market with increased sophistication in the design of the products While swaps did take place in the past most of them were shortterm swaps for durations between one to three months Indeed swaps of months were the longest available in the market Bankers had earlier cursed the lack of satisfactory benchmarks as holding back the market The problem still remains what is different is the bankers have found innovative ways to price longer term swaps Now the longterm interest swaps have gone up to even five years In an IRS two parties do a swap for a fixed duration wherein an exchange takes place which is mainly notional When bank rates fall a player reverses his position and books his profits Thus they receive a profit when rates actually fall and viceversa One party agrees to pay a fixed interest rate for the tenor of the swap while the other party agrees to pay a floating interest rate This floating interest is usually fixed on a benchmark from the debt markets which could vary from the Mumbai Interbank Overnight Rate Mibor or a synthetic rate derived usually based on a poll of market dealers The hindrance with these swaps is that the benchmarks for them are few and far between While some benchmark is on oneyear interest rate taken from the Reuters page poll of dealers some use the oneyear Tbill average yield against which the fixed rate is determined Therefore the increase in the number of interest rate swaps provides more bench marks than were available initially said a senior dealer with a foreign bank Says Tarun Mehrotri treasurer HSBC As a part of its broader strategy of providing customised and risk management and funding solutions to its clients we provide interest rate swap prices benchmarked on both shortterm rates such as Mibor CP rates and longterm rates such as oneyear TBills government security yields This provides clients the flexibility of choosing the benchmark that best suits their balance sheet needs and addresses their particular assetliability management requirements It is primarily a customerdriven and a customised market which is designed for the corporate keeping in mind their asset liability management point of view It is still not monitored Therefore it is difficult to come up with an estimate about the volumes said an analyst with a foreign bank A swap can be important tools for banks and corporates who want to hedge themselves against conflicting interest rate movements he added In the market place currently the average size of swaps is between Rs crore and Rs crore Even the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India Fimmda is now shifting its monthly curve to a daily curve allowing for more benchmarks The market has a few market makers right now but as the number of benchmarks increase and get validity the market will see more deals in the IRS market said Aashish Pitale vicepresident research JP Morgan Securities India Private Limited Swedish PM not sure of EU financial reform accord Reuters March By Jan Strupczewski STOCKHOLM March Reuters Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said on Thursday he doubted whether reforms to create a single European financial market would be approved at this weeks EU summit in Stockholm The reform is key to meeting the nation blocs selfimposed deadline of integrating its capital markets by to boost the competitiveness of European firms through the same easy cheap access to funding enjoyed by US rivals I am sorry to say I am not confident at all But we will try hard Persson told a news conference on the eve of the summit which will review progress made by the Union towards its goal of becoming the worlds most competitive region by We want to go ahead with it I hope we will be able to gather not only a majority but also unanimity for the reform he said EU finance ministers are due to meet later on Thursday to discuss the reform prepared by a team led by former central banker Alexandre Lamfalussy The Lamfalussy team proposed earlier this month that the EU should adopt a fast tack procedure under which framework laws could be swiftly enacted leaving details to be filled in later by a new European Securities Commission But the proposal has sparked power struggles between the Unions institutions and met with resistance from Germany which fears that its financial centres could be subjected to looser regulation modelled on London Swedish Finance Minister Bosse Rinholm who will chair the Thursday evening meeting devoted to the Lamfalussy proposals said agreement on the reform had reached percent The meeting will start at pm GMT and be followed by a news conference the Swedish EU presidency said COMMITMENT IN DOUBT Failure to back the proposals would cast doubt on the EUs public commitment to an integrated capital market and could further hit the already battered common currency The euros launch in created a European capital market with a common denomination but the market remains divided in many areas by national securities laws and accounting practices Britain Denmark and Sweden have opted to remain outside the euro for the time being The financial plan forms part of a wider agenda laid down by EU leaders last year to make the EU the worlds most competitive place to do business within a decade The March summit is due to review progress towards that goal It is of particular importance that the creation of a common market for risk capital and financial services will be implemented according to the timetables agreed Persson wrote in a column in tabloid Expressen on Thursday The task facing the finance ministers is to stop the issue from snarling up the summit The debate turns on the seemingly arcane point of how a new European Securities Committee would be able to block detailed legislation in areas such as issue prospectuses and insider trading proposed by the European Commission Credit derivatives pose unexpected risks says Moodys head of OTC Risknetcom March By John Ferry Credit deterioration rather than actual credit default could trigger credit default swap contracts under current International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA definitions according to a new report by Moodys Investor Service Moodys contends that ISDAS current definition of a credit event is broader than the general market understanding of default ISDAS current definitions could in some cases increase the risk of loss by triggering payouts for events that are not actually defaults contended Jeffrey Tolk in his report Understanding the Risks in Credit Default Swaps Under a credit default swap losses to investors are determined synthetically based on credit events occurring in a reference credit Thus investors risk is driven largely by the definition of credit events in the swap he added Credit default swaps are bought as a form of insurance against the risk of a bondissuing institution defaulting The report states that a restructuring of debt to defer principle payments may not technically be a default if the lender has been properly compensated although ISDA would define this as a credit event Under ISDAS definition of obligation acceleration a credit default swap investor might suffer a loss although an investor in the underlying cash position would not ISDA which is the leading market association for the derivatives industry has set up a committee to look at credit derivative trading practices in particular credit event definitions Moodys said it is difficult to value defaulted credits to determine the amount of loss to investors under a cashsettled credit default swap Calculated losses may vary based on liquidity market conditions and the identity of the parties supplying bids the report said There is also a moral hazard problem associated with credit default swaps which arises as it is the buyer of protection that determines when a loss event has occurred and how much loss is imposed on the counterparty The buyer has an incentive to be overgenerous in loss calculation and to define a credit event widely Moodys said The expanding credit derivatives market is increasingly gaining the attention of regulators In a speech made two weeks ago David Clementi deputy governor of the Bank of England said he was concerned that market participants may not fully understand the transactions they have entered Watch derivatives warns bank Euromoney March David Clementi deputy governor at the Bank of England says the use of credit derivatives in securitization poses a threat to capital market stability In the closing address to the International Bond Congress in London Clementi surprised borrowers investors and bankers with his concerns at the rapid growth of credit derivatives and ABS markets which many banks hope compensate for the shrinking returns in bond trading and underwriting Clementi said there was a danger of a lack of transparency in the market because of the increase in the use of synthetic CLOs where the risk attached to loans and bonds is sold on without a sale of the assets These markets mean that a bank need no longer remain exposed to its main customers but can rapidly take on large exposures to other credits without any new borrowing by the underlying entities he said Clementi said it was a major challenge for authorities such as the Bank of England or the Federal Reserve to keep pace with the rapidly changing world of securitization and derivatives in collecting financial statistics He also fears not all investors understand securitization Some participants in this market may not fully understand or may have differing understandings of the transactions into which they have entered he said adding that uncertainties remain about how courts in different countries I will treat covenants and agreements in credit derivative deals The case of LTY Steel illustrates his concern LTV is battling Abbey National in the US over ownership of assets securitized in a deal The judge appears to favour LTV though Abbey National says it will appeal if it loses Investors because of this risk have to make sure they have conducted due diligence said Clementi The merging of the lending securities and insurance markets raised new risks he said adding this risk was particularly evident now due to the debate over whether restructuring of debt constitutes a credit event thereby triggering a credit default swap This row was sparked when Conseco restructured its debt late last year The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has convened meetings to try and find agreement on this question The British Banking Association has predicted that the credit derivatives business will triple from billion in to billion in This item first appeared at bonds wwweuromoneycombonds Accounting changes spell m charge for Sears Financial Times March By Christopher Bowe Sears Roebuck Company the second largest US retailer said on Wednesday it plans about m in aftertax charges this year due to accounting rules changes The charges will stem from the retailers adoption of a new Financial Accounting Standards Board rule on companies accounting for use of derivatives and hedging instruments Sears detailed the move in its annual report filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission FASB amended rule No requires that all of a companys derivatives be marked to market valued and recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability Under the rules the fair value of the derivatives which could range from futures contracts to complex swaps transactions may be calculated according to earnings or in other comprehensive income provided certain conditions are met In that case derivatives gains or losses would be measured against the value of the item that is subject of the hedge on the income statement The new accounting rule became effective for all fiscal years starting after June last year Sears said it plans to use the new rule starting in the first quarter this year As a result it expects to take a cumulative m charge this year The transition to the new accounting standard includes recording a m cash flow hedging relationship on the balance sheet and reclassifying deferred losses from terminated interest rate swaps which amount to m Combined they are estimated before taxes at about m The company uses debt and interest rate derivatives and currency hedges to manage its risk Much of Sears profit comes from its credit card arm Sears also said in the filing that it expects about per cent operating income growth and at least per cent earnings per share growth this year Impatience and optimism on clearing Euromoney March By Jonathan Brown London hosted the first worldwide conference of central counterparties last month to discuss developing a system of seamless global clearing The conference was initiated by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation of the US Sir David Walker senior adviser to Morgan Stanley International underscored the importance large securities firms attach to this There is I believe a general recognition that the capacity to clear and settle trades has not kept pace with the capacity of trading platforms to attract liquidity and handle trades he said Without serious thought to improving clearing and settlement the present infrastructure will not be able to cope with large increases in volume and trading Representatives of central counterparties from the US Asia and Europe discussed procedures for operations and risk management the benefits of greater cooperation and legal ramifications All believe there are advantages to be gained from the more effective use of collateral in the systems as well as netting which reduces the amount of settlement that needs to be handled Referring to efforts to integrate regional clearing and settlement systems in Europe Walker said Far greater benefits will accrue if the CCP and netting arrangements of these new vertical structures are designed in an interoperable open architecture way Jill Considine chairman of DTCC was pleased with the progress Weve covered the landscape and gained some very important perspectives on enhancing CCP capabilities including the views of regulators exchanges as well as the views of our colleagues at other central counterparties around the world she remarked And we heard from our customers telling us how impatient they have grown with what they view as slow and piecemeal changes in the industrys infrastructure We must not lose sight of what the customers value most strong risk management low costs and the stability and reliability of a seamless infrastructure Basel gives banks the whip hand Euromoney March By Michael Peterson It has been a long and exhausting labour of love Between zoo and bank regulators from the wealthy G countries have flown many thousands of miles and held countless hours of meetings The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision which meets under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements BIS has spent the best part of two years rewriting the rules on bank capital The committee chaired by New York Federal Reserve president Bill McDonough steered the discussions But the bulk of the work was done by four major subcommittees Each subcommittee set up working groups to look into some detail of the proposed rules The biggest subcommittee the capital task force spawned no less than half a dozen subcommittees of its own The proposal document released on January r is suitably massive Its pages outline a new world order for bank capital which looks at first glance like a vast improvement on the capital accord Where the old agreement sketched out crude guidelines for calculating the amount of capital a bank needs the new proposals delve into the gritty intricacies of collateral haircuts clean break securitization materiality thresholds and granularity scaling factors Given the Herculean efforts of this dedicated band of officials it seems churlish to suggest that the proposals are flawed But serious doubts are emerging about the general direction the committee has taken The central element of the new rules is that big banks will be allowed to set their own capital using internal calculations of risk The regulators expect a good number perhaps to institutions to be doing this soon after the new accord is introduced in But Avinash Persaud State Streets head of global research reckons the trend towards greater reliance on bank risk management systems is a dangerous one It is a dereliction of duty by the regulators he says There is no industry with a longer history of being unable to control its own excesses Flawed accord The need to update the present rules is pressing Simplicity was the great virtue of the capital accord but it was also the big weakness The accord established guidelines for calculating bank capital with a basic minimum requirement of and weighting adjustments reflecting the riskiness of assets Members of the BIS then agreed to introduce these as the basis for national law The rules have quickly become the standard for other regulators too driving up levels of bank capital in many emerging markets for example The present rules apply a series of weights to the basic capital number for different assets on banks balance sheets Supposedly risky assets such as loans to corporates and assetbacked bonds are weighted at Debts to countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD are considered riskfree they are weighted at Exposures to banks based in OECD countries count as low risk assets and are weighted at The bank then has to hold capital equivalent to at least of its riskweighted assets And at least half of that capital has to be in the form of socalled tierone capital chiefly equity and reserves The figure is a minimum National regulators are free to impose higher levels The Federal Reserve for example prefers big US banks to hold capital The accords crude system of asset weightings creates some perverse effects It means banks based in OECD countries can get much cheaper funding than those outside the OECD club This is not necessarily a good thing for countries that join the OECD State Streets Persaud points out that the old Basel system produces regular OECD membership crises After they were admitted to the organization during the course of the s Mexico the Czech Republic Poland and Korea all experienced economic booms fuelled by suddenly cheaper credit A year or so later each boom promptly turned to bust Under the rules a junk bond portfolio with a heavy concentration of telecom names is weighted at Fair enough But a diversified loan book of highquality corporate names is rated at exactly the same level Banks know the Basel weightings produce a distorted picture of their true risk and many have become adept at finding ways to reduce their regulatory capital using tools such as securstization and credit derivatives Others have played the system for all it is worth stocking up on risky but lowweighted assets The old regime had broken down because of the complexity of what the large and sophisticated banks were doing says Oliver Page director of complex groups at the UK Financial Services Authority and a member of the Basel Committee It was leading to capital arbitrage and we could no longer be confident that the resulting capital matched the risks they were actually taking Dynamite in the draft The Basel Committees first thoughts on revising the capital accord were mostly about rejigging the problematic risk weightings A discussion document released in June proposed a series of refinements to the original risk bucket method The number of risk weighting bands would be increased and the OECD link would be scrapped But what better measure of credit risk could be used The committee proposed a controversial solution weighting assets according to their credit ratings from the private sector rating agencies The idea of incorporating credit ratings into the accord created a few misgivings For one thing many borrowers especially in Europe are not rated Some also worried that borrowers would cherrypick the most favourable ratings The agencies themselves were not overjoyed at the proposal They quibbled over what they saw as inconsistent application of their ratings from one asset class to another The proposal didnt stop at refining the weightings It introduced a couple of new ideas One was that banks should be charged for operational risk the risk of things like system failures and rogue traders But the real dynamite came halfway through the page document The committee conceded that a small number of very big sophisticated banks might be allowed to bypass the whole standard weightings process altogether They would be able to set their own capital requirements in consultation with their regulator using their own models of risk Risk modelling has become a growth industry in recent years Big banks argue that they can now model and manage their risk in a highly sophisticated way Their models give them a detailed picture of the risks inherent in their business and the amount of capital they need to set aside for those risks Usually the models say banks need to carry less capital than they would using the standard riskweighting method Between June and the end of as the committees and subcommittees met to thrash out the details of the new system the internalratings based approach grew into the biggest part of the proposals And no longer was it only the very biggest banks that would be allowed to use internal models Now any decentsize bank could aspire to calculating its own capital needs The big change from our June paper is that we have designed an internalratings based approach that a good number of banks should be able to apply says the FSAs Page In June we just talked about applying it to some sophisticated banks But over time we expect a major share of the banking system will be on the internalratings based approach It is not completely clear why the committee decided to apply the internalratings based approach more widely The official line is that a large number of banks have demonstrated their capability in risk modelling But some close observers reckon the committee was under strong pressure from some European authorities particularly the German representatives to allow a lower threshold for the internal models approach The new proposals talk about three approaches to setting capital The simplest the standardized approach is an extension of the present system but with risk buckets now linked to credit ratings A tripleA sovereign carries a risk weighting SingleA sovereigns doubleA corporates and tripleA supranationals are weighted at Most loans with a B in their rating fall into the bracket There are also two new weightings SingleA corporates and tripleB sovereigns fall into a band A few risky assets such as singleB corporates carry a weighting Where a borrower has two ratings the lower rating will be used to prevent cherrypicking The internalratings based approach divides into two different methods foundation and advanced Both approaches allow banks to calculate their own risks In the foundation method the regulator supplies some of the parameters for the model In the grownup version banks get to do all the calculations The internalratings based approach should have several big advantages over the simpler method It should dramatically reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage since the differences between a banks economic capital the capital that reflects its true risks and its regulatory capital will be too small to bother about The internalratings based method also has much steeper charges for the very riskiest assets Under the standardized approach the highest risk weighting is But under the internal models approach an asset could carry a weighting In other words for every dollar at risk the bank would set aside cents of capital assuming it was aiming for riskweighted capital But how can we trust banks to set their own capital The authors of the proposals give two reasons First the regulators will not simply sit back and let the banks do their own thing In fact they will need to step up their efforts to supervise banks recruiting teams of savvy analysts to pore over the banks calculations Second the market will police the system One lengthy section of the proposal known for no particularly good reason as pillar three requires banks to disclose to the market information on their risk exposures riskmanagement strategies and credit risk mitigation techniques We are moving towards a world in which the regulators step back and allow the market to police itself says Mark Intrater London based managing director at consultancy Oliver Wyman If a bank reports its risks and the market doesnt like it that bank will have a hard time getting funding on favourable terms and its stock price will drop The world is not ready for that yet but this is a step towards it Markets will always be able to move faster than any regulations that could be drafted Disclosure or what one analyst in attempt to catch the mood of the moment calls the Big Brother part of the proposals is designed to prevent banks abusing the internalratings based approach If we can get market discipline to work then it wont be the capital regime that drives the amount of capital banks have it will be market pressure says Page We see this already Because of market pressures banks already hold materially more capital than we set as their minimum Using banks internal models to calculate capital may be an attractive solution to the tricky problem of how to regulate large and sophisticated banks But the approach is open to several lines of criticism Some say the banks own models are not all they are cracked up to be Stare Streets Persaud says that banks do need riskmanagement systems but the ones they use today are imperfect These markersensitive riskmanagement systems all have the same philosophical flaw he says They assume that every bank is acting independently they assume that when they sell there is a marker to sell into In other words they understate the real riskiness of panicky illiquid markets The use of banks internal models can be a problem agrees Standard Poors analyst Tanya Azarchs to the extent that everyone starts to use the same kind of models to determine the credit risk of a loan If that model is falsesignalling it could cause real problems when everyone heads for the exits at the same time Whats more greater disclosure might exacerbate the problem of what Persaud calls herding We are going down the wrong path in insisting on more disclosure he says Every crisis follows a boom This tells us that the crisis is not about a lack of information It is not about some domestic ill that the right risk management system could have told us about The cause of the crisis lies somewhere in peoples collective loss of sense during the original boom Persaud believes the right approach to preventing crises is to encourage contrarian investing We need heterogeneity he says We need lots of different types of investors playing lots of different types of markets with lots of different strategies and risk management systems This emphasis on transparency is encouraging more herdlike and less contrarian behaviour This is why markets are becoming ever bigger in terms of turnover but ever thinner in terms of liquidity The proposals may discourage contrarianism in other ways too Use of internal credit models may exacerbate natural economic cycles by encouraging banks to lend heavily in the good times and cut back on credit when the economy turns down depressing ratings For example as the US economy has stalled in recent months bankruptcies have risen and credit ratings have fallen Banks internal credit models presumably show the same decline in asset quality Under the internalratings based approach banks riskweighted assets would now be increasing and their regulatory capital requirement would be going up That would encourage them to freeze new credits In times of rising credit quality the reverse would apply perhaps fuelling a boom Another criticism of the banks internal models is that they are not conservative enough SPs Azarchs thinks banks own capital models award them too much benefit for the diversity of their portfolios Banks internal portfolio models suggest they could run on as little as half the capital they have now she says We dont believe that is the case We dont think there is excess capital in the system If this proposal winds up decapitalizing the system that would be very concerning For now banks would not be entitled to a capital reduction purely on the grounds of credit diversity although this is something that the Federal Reserve has hinted could be introduced later As a result the banks calculations of regulatory capital will still typically come out higher than their calculations of economic capital under the internal models approach Unrealistically short maturities are another problem with banks own models Most banks internal models assume a hold rate of one year or less says Azarchs That is one reason their internal models show a capital surplus She believes the advanced internalratings based approach falls into the same trap of underestimating maturities The foundation version of the internalratings based approach assumes that all loans have a maturity of three years a reasonably cautious assumption But on the advanced approach banks will be able to plug the legal maturity of loans into their capital calculations Azarchs thinks this would be a mistake We dont think this is the right way to think about it she says A loan has nothing to do with its stated term it is representative of a relationship As long as things are going well one expects the loan to be rolled over If the capital models give recognition for short legal maturities banks may simply extend short loans and roll them over Banks would employ the same kind of capital arbitrage they do today when they extend day credit facilities such loans are designed to benefit from the zero risk weighting of undrawn loans with a maturity of less than one year National pride Another worrying aspect of the new modelsbased approach to bank capital is that it will mean different things to different regulators In a way this is no different from the situation with the current capital accord But at least the version has the virtue of being simple enough for the most backward regulator to understand Were not sure that all national regulators are equipped to supervise the internalratings based approach says Azarchs at SP There would probably be an incentive for all of them to vet a few of their largest banks right out of the gate on the assumption that these big sophisticated banks must know what they are doing National pride might also sway some regulators to treat their charges leniently There is still scope for significant discrepancies in the way these proposals are implemented particularly in pillar two supervision says John Tattersall partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in London Very few regulators will want the embarrassment of deciding that their major banks are short of capital So what is to stop a regulator letting a few of its banks graduate to the internalratings based approach even when their risk management systems are nor up to scratch The idea of a completely level playing field is an unreachable goal says Page at the FSA But we will have processes to try to ensure there is a reasonably evenhanded treatment across the G This will not be some kind of central policing It will involve being open about what is going on in each others countries and feeling free to comment Market forces act as another constraint If a supervisor is known to be a soft touch the banks under its supervision will be penalized in the market place Some large banks are privately worried that their own regulators will apply the new rules more harshly than supervisors in other countries The disclosure requirements in the proposal are another big source of concern for some of them The committee seems to have taken a kitchensink approach to disclosure says Tattersall at PricewaterhouseCoopers Everything that might be desirable seems to have been included But Page at the FSA appears to offer some hope that the disclosure requirements will be watered down You need a fair amount of information to make the internalratings based approach work he says The disclosure requirements we have proposed are desirable but we also need to be sure they are cost effective for banks It may be there are better ways of arriving at the same results I certainly hope banks will give us good feedback on this point The Basel accord is only supposed to apply in the Gin countries but some observers have begun to think about the impact of the proposals on the rest of the world Basel was never designed for emergingmarket banks says Ian Linnell an analyst at Fitch in London But in reality it is adopted by any banking system that wants to be taken seriously And the idea that riskier entities should hold more capital is definitely one that should apply to banks in emerging markets He believes the proposals could have some unintended consequences in less developed banking systems ln practice most emerging market regulators will adopt the standardized version with some modifications Others will stick with the current version of the accord something they are perfectly entitled to do We will end up with four different methodologies for calculating bank capital the version of Basel the standardized approach the foundation internalratings based approach and the advanced internalratings based approach says Linnell Add the salt and pepper of charges for things like operational risk and you have a recipe for confusion The whole concept of a minimum level of tierone capital could become relatively meaningless Time to collect data One key uncertainty in all this is how many banks will use each of the three new ways of calculating capital The consensus at the moment is that a minority of banks but a majority of banking assets will quickly move to using internal models My sense is that in about banks around the world will adopt the foundation approach immediately and that maybe two or three will go straight for the advanced approach says Azarchs at SP Within half a decade the best part of too institutions could be setting their own capital That means banks need to start crunching a lot more data The timing is tight says Tattersall at PricewaterhouseCoopers Banks need to start collecting the data next year in order to have the necessary three years of historical data by In order to use the foundation version of the internalratings approach banks need to input reliable data for every assets probability of default If they want to graduate to advanced they should also be able to make assumptions about loss severity or recovery rates The internalratings based approach looks great in theory says Linnell at Fitch But there is a real problem with the quality of data Banks may have a reasonably good handle on probability of default but it is very hard to get hold of data on recovery rates Up until now banks have been surprisingly poor at keeping consistent records on how many of their borrowers have defaulted and how much of a hit they took as a result Even the most rigorous institutions are hazy about some areas of their business Most big sophisticated banks have rating systems for some loans that would pass regulatory muster says Intrater at Oliver Wyman But they also have categories of special loans that are managed in a less sophisticated manner It is simply the difference between using a system for internal management purposes and using it for external reporting purposes Clearly banks will need to improve their record keeping It has been widely suggested that this scramble to put new systems in place will increase the pace of banking consolidation Smaller banks it is assumed will not be able to make the necessary investment in technology On the other hand bank mergers have often made it more difficult to get systems in place According to Azarchs at SP Canadian banks have some of the best historical data in the world This is because Canadian institutions have been prevented from merging US banks by contrast often find it difficult to reconcile data from a number of legacy systems One widespread assumption so far has been that smaller banks will ignore the internalratings based methods and stick with the standardized approach A lot of small specialist retail operations will quite appropriately ignore everything beyond the standardized approach says Intrater But the internal models approach could yet gain a momentum of its own If internal models are successfully used by as many as o or o banks to reduce their capital requirements smaller banks may want to join the party too This will certainly be the case if the technology and expertise needed to use the approach become relatively cheap commodities Perhaps one or two banks might develop a certain way of doing internalratings based measurement and start to franchise that procedure out to smaller banks suggests Raj Malhotra credit analyst at Goldman Sachs in London Smaller banks might be willing to pay for that Just as the original Basel accord was soon adopted much more widely than it was originally intended so the internalratings based approach could become the standard for any bank which aspires to international respectability Once the floodgates of internal capital calculation have been opened they may not be easily closed Power to the regulator If that happens a lot of regulators will need to learn a whole new set of skills There are broadly two approaches to bank regulation The first involves laying down the rules and checking that banks comply with them The second often called bank supervision is more intensive it involves making individual judgements about each banks risks and appropriate levels of capital and continually checking that banks are playing it safe The FSA is proud of its record in bank supervision In the UK we have recognized for a long time that there is no way to collect all the information you need put it through some number cruncher and come out with an answer for the amount of capital a bank needs says Page There are areas where judgement is required in forming the answer The Basel Committee proposals have quite a lot to say about banking supervision or in Baselspeak pillar two The proposal exhorts regulators to review banks internal capital adequacy assessments and to intervene early to stop a banks capital falling below the level appropriate to that banks risk characteristics But this level of supervision will be much harder for some regulators to put in practice than others And it is not simply that some regulators are smart and others are dullards Regulators such as the Federal Reserve have the advantage of a relatively small number of large banks to manage says Intrater at Oliver Wyman Others such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which regulates smaller US institutions supervise a large number of small banks They will need a much larger staff of supervisors Some observers have the feeling that the more cluedup regulators notably the Federal Reserve and the FSA are getting too far ahead of their less sophisticated colleagues A lot of national regulators lack the powers to go in and do this kind of pillartwo supervisory control says Azarchs at SP In addition they may not have the experience or the staff to do it Is it realistic to expect all regulators to supervise their banks in the way set out in the proposals Not all supervisors will suddenly set differentiated requirements for all banks says Page at the FSA But I would expect that they will look at some of the bigger ones and at some of the outliers But the Basel Committee cant force countries to invest in creating powerful and expert regulators even though this is exactly what the internalratings based approach requires These proposals appear to give greater powers to the market but in some ways they do the opposite says Linnell at Fitch Regulators will need to set key data inputs and supervise the entire internalratings based approach That will increase the burden on regulators Many are not going to have the people or expertise to cope The big uncertainty of the Basel proposals lies with the capabilities of the worlds bank regulators Much of the epic work they have written makes good sense But when the new accord is implemented in the real world it will like the accord before it take on a life of its own Administrator for Policy Media Relations ISDA Fifth Avenue Rockefeller Center th floor New York NY Phone Fax Email Ivygif

continued to dominate credit derivatives trading on Tuesday Reuters March LONDON March Reuters Crisishit Argentina continued to dominate credit derivatives trading on Tuesday almost knocking the Federal Reserves decision on US interest rates due later in the day off its perch as chief talking point The price of five year default swaps for Argentina widened out to from at the start of the week traders said The move was even more dramatic at the shorterend of the curve with oneyear credit protection on Argentine debt being quoted at from Credit default swaps the most active part of the credit derivatives market are insurancelike tools that enable investors to juggle exposure to the risk of an issuer defaulting on a debt or loan The resignation of economy minister Ricardo Lopez Murphy after just two weeks in office has heightened a political crisis in Argentina that threatens to spill over into other emerging markets This follows Lopez Murphys efforts to lift the economy out of recession with a searing austerity programme aimed at raising investor confidence Domingo Cavallo the architect of Argentinas embattled ten yearold fixed exchange rate regime was named his successor With Cavallo yet to set out his policy programme to cut billion off the Argentine fiscal deficit and tackle the countrys crisis it remained to be seen how the US market would open For Argentina the liquidity has just dried up on the default swaps What offers are out there are distressed a New York based trader at a US bank said Events in Argentina hit the rest of the emerging markets asset class Latin America generally is better bid and offers are few and far between a broker said Among the other sovereigns affected was South Africa The five year default swap is at and the three year is at and thats more than worse than last week he added BACK IN EUROPE Trading conditions elsewhere were described as relatively thin but if traders were keeping their powder dry ahead of the US FOMC meeting they werent saying In Europe the story remained one of default swap prices on corporate debt edging inwards and edging outwards on telecoms debt The general trend for European corporates for the past week has been one of prices trading lower with bids being hit and offers being lifted a broker said Were talking small mind he added maybe basis points tighter below a price of

Libor Fiveyear default swaps on the debt of France Telecom were cited by the dealer at unchanged since Monday and on Deutsche Telekom also unchanged CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY SUBJECT INVESTORS TO UNEXPECTED RISKS Moodys March New York March In a new special report outlining potential risks in credit default swaps Moodys Investors Service says that if credit events are defined too broadly a credit default swap may pass along the risk of loss following mere credit deterioration instead of the risk of loss following an actual default Investors often assume the risk of a synthetic investment by way of a credit derivative is equivalent to the risk of a cash investment in the same credit However if not structured carefully the synthetic investment can be riskier than the cash investment says Jeffrey Tolk a Moodys analyst and author of the report Understanding the Risks of Credit Default Swaps Among Moodys key sources of concern are the prevailing standard definitions for credit events Under a credit default swap losses to investors are determined synthetically based on credit events occurring in a reference credit Thus investors risk is driven largely by the definition of credit events in the swap The broader the definition the broader the risk according to Moodys SOME STANDARD DEFINITIONS ARE BROAD Moodys report includes a detailed look at the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations ISDA widely referenced credit event definitions In some critical areas ISDAs current definitions are broader than the markets understanding of default and could in some cases increase the risk of loss by triggering payouts for events that are not actually defaults says Tolk An obligation that has been restructured to defer principal payments may not technically be a default if the lender has been properly compensated But ISDA would nonetheless define this as a credit event he says Conversely under ISDAs definition of obligation acceleration a credit default swap investor might suffer a loss although an investor in the underlying cash position would suffer no loss OTHER SOURCES OF RISK VALUATION DISCREPANCY MORAL HAZARD In addition to credit events Tolk cites the risks that arise from the difficulty of valuing defaulted credits to determine the extent of loss to investors under a cashsettled credit default swap Calculated losses may vary based on liquidity market conditions and the identity of the parties supplying bids In analyzing a credit default swap Moodys looks carefully at the methods and procedures for calculating loss given default he says The report also says that investors should be aware of moral hazard the inherent conflict of interest that exists because the sponsoring financial institution determines the timing of a loss event as well as how much loss is imposed on investors The sponsors incentive is to construe credit events as expansively as possible and to calculate losses as generously as possible says Tolk Moodys considers these factors carefully when rating securities supported by credit default swaps Tolk believes that these risks can be addressed by tightening the credit event and loss calculation provisions increasing transparency and providing more objective mechanisms for verifying loss determinations The capital markets have an enormous capacity for absorbing credit risk and this capacity has only been partially tapped by the credit derivatives market In Moodys opinion for capital markets investors to participate fully in the growing credit derivatives market the risks inherent in credit default swaps should be more precisely defined more transparently managed and more readily quantifiable How traders in capacity can make rapid new connections Financial Times March By Alan Stewart Online trading exchanges have been set up in many sectors of commerce and telecommunications is no exception But while some exchanges focus on physical goods such as car components or hospital supplies the telecoms version is dealing with something more intangible bandwidth A number of online exchanges have been set up to trade in bandwidth matching buyers and sellers via bid and offer prices and taking a percentage of the price paid According to research by Arthur Andersen the telecoms market will be transformed by bandwidth trading The bandwidth being traded may take the form of physical circuits linking two cities or the data packets and voice calls sent over them A recent Europewide survey by Andersen revealed a market in flux but one which believed in the inevitability of bandwidth commoditisation Online bandwidth trading exchanges have arrived in response to a need because of a bandwidth glut says Simon Forge principal telecommunications analyst at UK consultancy OSI For some of the latest networks going in people are claiming petabits per second thats a billion megabits per second Exchanges have been set up by Arbinet based in New York BandX London and RateXchange San Francisco see accompanying stories Other exchanges already running or being set up include GlobalTeleExchange GTE in Washington Asia Capacity Exchange ACE in Hong Kong International Telecommunications Clearing Corporation ITCC in Dubai and eSwitch Sydney Buyers and sellers of bandwidth are linked up through interconnecting facilities at the switching hubs of the exchanges RateXchange has nine of these in the US plus three in Europe while ITCC intends to have hubs in London Hong Kong Los Angeles New York and Miami The exchanges stress that these connections mean that bandwidth trades will be able to be carried out in seconds At present it can take up to three months to arrange a trade with most of those arranged not actually taking place at all According to investment bank CIBC World Markets Dollars bn in revenues per cent of the wholesale bandwidth market may be traded by Andersen says the bandwidth market has suffered from a lack of liquidity and price transparency combined with a paucity of offers and bids on the exchanges The company believes however that the presence of big energy companies such as Enron and Williams in bandwidth trading is stimulating the appetite of customers for greater product innovation and pricing Bandwidth is expected to follow a shorter timeline to liquidity than any other current traded commodity Although the detail of the emerging market has still to be defined Andersen expects citypairs that is two named cities connected by fiber optic cable to form the basic product Jon Merriman president and chief executive of RateXchange foresees four market segments becoming involved in bandwidth trading within the next year The first are the energy merchants the second the telecommunications companies as a business line the third the financial houses and the fourth the pure commodity players he says A fifth market segment and this is longer term will be large corporates wholl want to trade and optimise their use of bandwidth says Mr Merriman Itll become a treasury function at some point for large companies Thats at least a year down the road but there is interest right now from some large corporates Andersen points out that energy businesses such as Enron Williams Aquila El Paso TXU and Dynegy have made significant investments in backbone customer and skills development in the last few years Those companies presence has had a considerable influence on the growing bandwidth market Steve Elliott chief executive of Enron Broadband Services EBS Europe says the communications market needs to become much more open and robust and that this will change the supply and demand dynamics Its already moving that way says Mr Elliott who stresses that EBS does not see itself in competition with bandwidth exchanges Exchanges exist in all the markets we participate in and theyre an overlay to the actual market itself he says Were not an exchange nor are we an independent player at the exchange level nor a bulletin board type of facilitator Were a market maker a principal in all transactions that we do with contractual terms and physical delivery obligations EBS is creating pooling points to provide physical interconnectivity between bandwidth trading principals Although EBSs plans for doing business in Europe are still at a fairly early stage the company has set up a pooling point in London to provide bandwidth trading between the US and Europe Further European pooling points are in Amsterdam Brussels Dusseldorf Frankfurt and Paris Enron Online Bandwidthrelated commodities have recently been added to the Enron Online webenabled ecommerce platform where the company posts its prices and carries out commodity trading Enron Online is the largest ecommerce web platform in the world for buying and selling commodities says Mr Elliott Weve transacted a notional value of over Dollars bn since its inception around a year ago The energy companies are all copying Enron which is a very progressive rather fabulous company says Marcus de Ferranti co founder of the BandX He points out that Enron is leveraging its own network into its trading and thereby becoming a kind of telecommunications company in its own right Mr de Ferranti suggests the other energy companies are desperately trying to get into the broadband revolution having seen Enrons share price double on the announcement of broadband Theyre coming along in a frenzy trying to copy it and leverage their own infrastructures by sticking fiber along the top of their gas pipes and sticking cables along their electricity highways he says But how do the telecommunications companies view bandwidth trading exchanges Do they see them as speeding up the commoditisation of bandwidth leading to a deterioration of prices At the most senior level the telecoms companies are attracted by what were providing says Anthony Craig chairman and chief executive of Arbinet As you come down some see it as a threat or even say that were a catalysing force for commoditisation I find that on the verge of ludicrous because bandwidth is commoditising anyway says Mr Craig Anything that commoditises needs a more efficient process to manage the product Were responding to commoditisation As for the future the online bandwidth exchanges may face some of the pressures which have caused problems for other BB businesstobusiness marketplaces US analyst International Data Corporation IDC foresees a challenge for bandwidth trading companies in collecting fees and believes exchanges may suffer payment defaults IDC warns also that profit margins could dwindle as bandwidth costs fall taking margins with them I suspect that bandwidth exchanges will have a relatively limited window of opportunity during which time they will make good money says Ian Beeby UK managing director of US consultancy Wireless Facilities Mr Forge at OSI agrees that some of the exchanges will go out of business However he argues Longterm this is something thats here to stay Watchful eye on energy traders Financial Times March By Anthony Cox After the sharp falls in their shares since last summer telcos worldwide might despair at the threat from US energy traders such as Enron to revolutionise how capacity on carriers networks is bought and sold further depressing the prices operators can charge for bandwidth their staple product In two to three years realtime trades on bandwidth for immediate delivery will be possible These will replace at least to some extent the drawn out negotiations between operators when selling space on their networks to one another But if new trading models will exert downward pressure on bandwidth prices by increasing transparency and ironing out market inefficiencies an environment where bandwidth is traded through purposebuilt exchanges has its benefits to operators In the short term it will provide a more liquid channel for selling spare capacity says Stuart McIntosh vice president of the Bostonbased consultancy Adventis Longer term it may have an impact on how operators manage the roll out of their networks he says Leasing capacity in the short term will become increasingly attractive and operators will opt more and more to buy or rent capacity from their rivals instead of building their own infrastructure Bandwidth trading may also increase volumes for operators by creating new sales avenues Exchanges open up new segments in the market many of which you wouldnt do business with if it was down to personal relationships says Cecilia Herslow carrier manager at Telia UK Further operators could benefit from lower sales costs as the expense of setting up longterm capacity deals between operators is replaced with lower per trade costs at the exchanges says Martin Smillie vice president for marketing wholesale at KPNQwest He notes however that the operator will incur costs to set up and maintain trading capability whether on its own behalf or via third party trading houses Some per cent of carriers expecting a liquid traded bandwidth market to emerge within three years according to research by Arthur Andersen A market for derivatives which could eventually dwarf the primary market will follow close on the heels of a market for physical bandwidth Two types of bandwidth exchanges are emerging those that trade bandwidth capacity on specific routes say London to New York socalled routed capacity and those that trade data and voice minutes usually via internet exchanges such as Arbinet and BandX According to Ciara Ryan a senior manager in Arthur Andersens bandwidth trading team the routed capacity market will be the most significant in terms of revenues for operators due to increased pressure to find new channels to market the capacity they own on these routes Owners of capacity are eager to sell their bandwidth as quickly as possible without destroying margins completely he says noting that bandwidth prices are falling by up to per cent annually on transatlantic and European routes Several routes or city pairs will provide a yardstick for the prices for capacity between other cities Capacity on these other routes will trade at a discount or a premium to those that have become the benchmarks says Mr Ryan Some loss of margins may be an acceptable tradeoff for more efficient markets and possible higher volumes of traffic for operators particularly since bandwidth prices are expected to come down in any case due to capacity oversupply Turn to next page From facing page But bandwidth exchanges impact on pricing could be more significant The whole pricing structure is potentially at risk says Nigel Pitcher director of marketing at UKbased carrier Fibernet If spare capacity is sold on an anonymous basis to an exchange the operators existing list price customers could pick up the same capacity at an exchange at a knockdown price while unknowingly remaining with the provider they had originally he says This could cause bandwidth prices to fall dramatically Downward pressure on the price of capacity would be increased if large users were to curtail existing relationships with their operators altogether buying direct from the bandwidth exchanges This threat is dismissed by telecoms industry players however There is no reason why large telecom users could not lease bandwidth today under most regulatory regimes says Ian Beeby managing director of WFI a wireless telecommunications consultancy Mr Beeby notes that most large corporations have spent the last years trying to outsource their telecom networks and that they are unlikely to change direction now The extent to which operators either embrace the new status quo or reject it may define their success in an environment where longterm bandwidth contracts are being replaced by more immediate trading models Carriers will either take on a very proactive approach or a more defensive strategy says Ms Herslow at Telia If a player does not move fast enough a penalty of ignorance may result in some operators losing the first mover advantage suggest analysts This in turn may result in a loss of competitiveness relative to other players fuelling consolidation among global carriers says Christian Jepsen the founder of Pangea a panEuropean carrier with a focus on Scandinavia Ultimately there may be three to four global carriers and only a handful of regional ones left he says In anticipation of significant changes in the market Pangea is already establishing a separate sales team to focus exclusively on capacity sales via bandwidth exchanges In an increasingly complex market telecommunications operators have no choice but to explore new ways to exchange telecom capacity The sheer number of telecoms players now means that bilateral agreements between carriers will become increasingly obsolete Internationally there are some carriers If they all were all to lease some capacity from one another nearly m interconnects contracts and settlements would be required across the industry Avoiding a proliferation of contracts alone is likely to change the way operators deal with one another on bandwidth deals Although it is too early to see the full implications of bandwidth trading on todays telecoms market operators are keeping the developments under very close review Bandwidth trading may prove to be a interesting idea which simply did not make it but it would be rash to conclude that today says Mr McIntosh at Adventis He also warns that the US energy players could leverage their experience of establishing trading in the energy market to carve a significant niche in the telecoms sector This is borne out by recent developments energy operators Williams and Enron are understood to have joined forces recently with ATT Sprint Global Crossing and Dow Jones to provide the first index for routed bandwidth capacity If I were in a telecoms company I would be watching the energy traders very closely says

International News Swaps may move warns BIS Financial Products Greenspan Encourages Banks Not to Exercise Too Much Caution BNA ISDA seeks derivatives product documentation standard Risk News OTC strength hampers new exchange issues Risk News BoE Clementi Wants More Transparency In Derivatives Mkts Dow Jones International News By Gonzalo Vina LONDON Dow Jones Bank of England Deputy Governor David Clementi said Friday that booming derivatives markets need to be more transparent to avoid risks to the stability of financial markets According to prepared remarks for a speech to be delivered at a central banking conference at the Bank of Italy in Rome Clementi said the documentation recording transactions in derivatives markets also needs to be improved to avert wider shocks in financial markets In the banking system capital and liquidity management are crucial to the management of these risks and have to be adapted to new circumstances Clementi said But the attention of central banks and regulators cant end there Recent developments in the credit transfer markets and the concerns identified regarding risk management and documentation for credit derivatives illustrate this he added Clementi said one of the benefits of the rapid expansion of credit derivative markets worth around billion a year is that banks need no longer remain exposed to their large customers But these same customers can now take on further exposure to other forms of credit through these new instruments without increasing their borrowing This he argues makes it more difficult for creditors shareholders and regulators to assess risk Clementi warned that the documentation relating to many of these transactions is often misunderstood or is taken to have different meanings by different parties He is also worried about how courts in different countries would treat these contracts Swaps may move warns BIS Financial Products March By Andrea Reierson Consolidation in the global banking sector could make it harder to keep swaps the preserve of the OTC marketplace and may push them onto a centralised exchange the Bank for International Settlements BIS said in its quarterly review Creditconscious customers are losing their ability to diversify counterparty credit risk particularly in their derivatives transactions the BIS said in its report for the fourth quarter of last year This increasing concentration of swap books may spark strong pressure for swaps listed on an organised exchange where counterparty risk is taken by the exchanges clearing house BIS said Later this month Liffe is to roll out futures contracts based on euro swaps which will allow traders to hedge two five and tenyear swap contracts in the same way bond traders use futures to hedge positions BIS also noted the market shift in fixed income benchmarks from government bonds to shorterterm instruments particularly in the US This comes amid the trend of declining government debt issuance and debt buybacks while financing grows among parastatal and private sector financing This would likely see derivatives exchanges introducing contracts based on underlying assets such as corporate bonds and assetbacked securities In a study accompanying the quarterly review the BIS found that private instruments eclipsed government paper as a benchmark in the dollar money market over the last two decades And the bond markets shift away from government securities may have continued even without the declining stock of US government debt issuance Trading in interest rate swaps has risen relative to futures and options trading in Treasury notes and bonds with transactions in couponbearing US Treasuries peaking in while those in private instruments continue to rise the BIS said Global exchangetraded derivatives activity rose in the fourth quarter of last year to trillion buoyed by rising volumes of equity derivatives trade while an increase in moneymarket transactions offset a decline in government bond related trade BIS said in its quarterly review For as a whole the value of exchangetraded products rose from the previous year to tr The value of Interest rate product transactions also grew to tr Weakening stock markets and increased volatility boosted equityrelated trade prompting increased hedging by investors BIS said Expectations of easier monetary policy in the US led to buoyant activity in short term interest rate products with the dollar value of US money market contracts up The continued expansion of the interest rate swaps market also underpinned demand for money market products typically the most common hedging vehicle for swaps and swaptions By the end of June last year the total notional amount outstanding of all OTC derivatives stood at tr up from the same period in The notional outstanding amount of OTC singlecurrency interest rate derivatives was tr while OTC equitylinked derivatives posted a gain of to tr Greenspan Encourages Banks Not to Exercise Too Much Caution BNA March Even as he acknowledged that lax credit standards can jeopardize banks solvency and have contributed to deteriorating bank earnings Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan March cautioned bankers not to be overly careful about making loans Lenders and their supervisors should be mindful that in their zeal to make up for past excesses they do not overcompensate and inhibit or cut off the flow of credit to borrowers with credible prospects Greenspan told a convention of the Independent Community Bankers of America in Las Vegas Greenspan said community bank lending has had little to do with recent contractions in loan quality Todays problems generally relate to syndicated credits especially those to leveraged borrowers he said As problems materialized earnings fell significantly for some of the larger banks which in turn caused aggregate commercial bank industry earnings to fall slightly during thus bringing to an end the industrys string of ten consecutive years of higher earnings Nevertheless though the effects of these excesses are likely to continue for much of this year in the form of moderately deteriorating asset quality and earnings at some of the larger banks these problems one hopes will prove modest both by historical standards and relative to the resources of these institutions Greenspan said bank regulators are paying close attention to smaller commercial banks increased real estate lending Though underwriting practices appear to be much healthier today than they were in the s and standards have tightened somewhat recently supervisors are paying particular attention to community banks with concentrations that make them materially vulnerable to a downturn in this market he said Nevertheless Greenspan was also somewhat critical of banks lending judgment It is interesting to note that the length of the current expansion coupled with the absence of problem commercial loans until recently has led to some depreciation in both bankers and supervisors skill in handling weakened or troubled credits he said referring to the problem lending of the late s and early s To community bankers concerned that it has become increasingly difficult to attract the deposits necessary to maintain a healthy lending portfolio Greenspan offered the other side of the coin It is also important to recognize that the reduction in portfolio liquidity is more a product of good businesshigh loan demandthan of the relatively slow growth in core deposits Greenspans comments further confirm earlier indications that he does not support proposals to raise deposit insurance coverage provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation above the current per account provided now Recently FDIC adopted the position that deposit insurance coverage levels should be raised Several bills pending in Congress would raise coverage levels to per account Banks OK With Basel Lastly Greenspan said most banks have submitted comments to the Fed in support of the new Basel Accord which recommends new capital standards for banks Responses to a request for comment related to the new Basel Accord and an alternative proposal by the Fed that could simplify capital standards for US banks show that most banks prefer the Basel Accord he said The responses to date indicate that community banks in general do not believe that the current accord is burdensome mainly because the costs of adapting systems and reporting for such an approach have already been incurred Greenspan said Indeed some commentators indicated that a change to an even simpler system would in itself be more burdensome than sticking with the current regime The Fed the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency the Office of Thrift Supervision and FDIC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on the matter in October Comment letters have indicated cautious support for simpler methods of calculating capital adequacy but not if simplicity means meeting tougher capital criteria Many banks have also reported to the Fed that they are not in favor of a standalone leverage ratio with much less complexity and reporting if it means that bank supervisors would set the a minimum ratio higher than is required by the current leverage standard Greenspan said Many of the responses indicated that was not a favorable tradeoff even though most community banks have exceptionally strong leverage ratios he said I should emphasize that we are still analyzing your many excellent comments to determine what kind of response we should give ISDA seeks derivatives product documentation standard Risk News March By John Ferry Members attending the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA conference in Houston this week reached general agreement that there is a need to standardise derivatives master agreements legally binding counterparty contracts There was much discussion about reconciling the variety of product documents for risk management purposes said Ruth Ainslie senior policy director at ISDA the global trade association that represents overthecounter OTC derivatives market participants The possibility of creating a single master master agreement that covers both physical and financial products was actively discussed with advocates citing such contracts would improve efficiency by simplifying the negotiation process for market operators Doubts were expressed by some participants however regarding the feasibility of developing a master master contract especially concerning administration legal and negotiation difficulties with crossaffiliate master agreements OTC strength hampers new exchange issues Risk News March By Christopher Jeffery The continuing dominance of the overthecounter OTC derivatives marketplace has meant the plethora of new exchangetraded products introduced in the past few years have had only limited success While a number of contracts like year Treasury notes have seen significant trading volumes evidence collated by the Bank for International Settlements BIS suggests that growth has been at the expense of other exchangetraded contracts and not due to an erosion of OTC activity Few of the contracts introduced by established marketplaces in recent years have met with an enthusiastic response and the gains enjoyed by some contracts have largely reflected a reallocation of business away from traditional benchmarks said BIS economist Serge Jeanneau in the international bodys Quarterly Review Jeanneau added that this trend was most acute in the US where net repayments of government debt combined with a shift of issuance to intermediate maturities have affected the liquidity of the Treasury bond contract and led to a near displacement by the year Treasury note Europe however has also witnessed displacement activity A reallocation of activity also took place in Europe in the late s with Eurex capturing business in the longterm segment of the euro yield curve and Liffe achieving dominance in the shortterm area said Janneau in the report Janneau believes the falling number of nongovernment issues in the near future will lead to exchanges introducing contracts based on corporate and assetbacked securities Examples of likely future behaviour include the US Bond Market Associations move last September to develop proposals for a corporate bond futures contract and CBOTs efforts to introduce mortgagebacked contracts Janneau added that he also expects exchanges to look at introducing instruments based on broader fixedincome indexes and not just government or corporate securities in the next few years Many investment banks already offer such services End of ISDA Press Report for March THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR

Reuters March LONDON March Reuters William McDonough chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said on Thursday he would not extend the consultation period for comments on the new Basel Capital Accord McDonough is also president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank He was in London for a British Bankers Association conference on the Basel accord A new accord designed to make capital adequacy rules for banks more risk sensitive was launched in January Banks and other interested groups were given until May to respond Many European banks have been critical of the short consultation period but McDonough has previously shrugged off this criticism arguing that banks were involved in developing the accord and a first proposal had been made in June The consultation period which we know is shortbut we are not going to extend it McDonough told a news conference The Basel Committee intends to finalise the new Capital Accord by the end of this year so it can be implemented in national jurisdictions in Benchmark Tipping Is Favoring Swaps Over Treasurys Dow Jones March By Michael Mackenzie NEW YORK Dow Jones The near collapse of hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in triggered a massive liquidity crisis in capital markets It also marked the beginning of the end for the role of Treasurys as a benchmark for pricing other debt securities and hedging for duration and volatility according to a study by the Bank of International Settlements BIS While the debate over alternative benchmarks for Treasurys has bounced between the relative merits of swaps and agency debt swaps appear to be winning the hearts and minds of a trading community that has learnt the lessons of hedging risk with Treasurys a point that the BIS seems to support In its report titled Benchmark Tipping In The Money And Bond Markets the BIS cited the bitter lessons in the aftermath of the LTCM meltdown as a direct cause for the ascendancy of interest rate swaps at the expense of Treasury securities as a benchmark for capital markets And though the question of swaps replacing Treasurys has been discussed since the US government announced its debt buyback program the thrust of the BIS report is that such a move was perhaps inevitable More recently the bond market has shifted away from its reliance on government securities and might well have continued to do so even if there had been no reduction in the stock of outstanding US government paper writes the BIS In fact the BIS said the burgeoning popularity of swaps is creating a powerful vortex within capital markets Each market participant who gives up using US Treasuries to hedge private instruments subtracts liquidity from the Treasury market and adds it to the swap market thus raising the incentives for other market participants to do likewise writes the BIS History On Their Side With history acting as a guide the BIS has observed that the benchmark is tipping from Treasury paper to the swap The BIS cited two precedents for benchmark tipping when market participants migrate to using a private instrument such as an interest rate swap instead of a Treasury security The most recent event following the flight to quality rush by investors which resulted in the threemonth Eurodollar futures contract eclipsing the Treasury bill futures contract in terms of volume occurred on the heels of the LTCM near collapse Investors rapidly diluted their exposure to other credit securities and flocked to the safe haven of US Treasurys meaning that dealers shorting Treasurys against being long spread product including corporate bonds agency securities and mortgages discovered that their hedges melted down The lessons learned from these traumatic episodes in capital markets have been recently observed since December when mortgage investors primarily turned to swaps instead of Treasurys to hedge prepayment risks of mortgages in what is known as the negative convexity trade Estimates of swap volume by several investment banks since the mortgage hedging began total in the region of billion in terms of receiving a fixed rate of interest via a swap contract Valuation Versus Investment Benchmarks Swaps are being increasingly used by traders as a benchmark for valuation purposes hedging pricing and establishing relative value across different asset classes The swaps market is generally the province of the leveraged buyer whether hedge funds dealers or asset swappers wrote analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York in a research note last month Because levered investors determine the marginal bid for credit product swap spreads and not government securities have become the defacto benchmark for credit valuation Swaps perform like a synthetic bond and involve the exchange of two cash flow streams One leg comprises a fixed rate of interest priced as a spread over a Treasury security that is traded against a floating rate of interest pegged to the threemonth London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR Thus they are not a physical asset that can used as an investment benchmark acting as an index measuring excess returns by money managers Ultimately it will be up to money fund managers and not traders to determine whether swaps will become a viable benchmark said George Oomman derivatives strategist at Lehman Brothers Although the growing supply of debt issued by the Government Sponsored Agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently over trillion is a real asset the agencys remain susceptible to political pressure changing their charters and reducing their better than AAA rating The market is looking at swaps and should Treasurys continue to shrink the market will steadily move to swaps said Robert Auwaerter senior fixed income portfolio manager at The Vanguard Group in Malvern PA It brings the products to the attention Reuters March By Tom Bergin LONDON March Reuters A legal wrangle between Swiss bank UBS and Germanys Deutsche Bank AG over a credit derivative contract has highlighted concerns about potential risks in a relatively new sector of the market News this week of a lawsuit filed by UBS in Britains High Court of Justice comes at a time when the industry is trying to convince regulators to adopt more favourable treatment of credit derivatives in the updated Basel Accord on capital requirements This is illustrative of the general uncertainty of how this market works said Richard Boulton credit risk manager at the Financial Services Authority FSA the UKs financial services regulator There is not absolute certainty that these techniques will work all the time he said speaking earlier this week when news of the lawsuit filed in February came to light Draft proposals updating the Basel Accord treat risks on credit derivatives as greater than for more tried and tested means of hedging credit risk such as bank guarantees As a result they require more money to be set aside to cover risk The market body the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA is pressing Basel regulators for talks about aspects of the proposals which it says are unfair The case wont help the image of credit derivatives Well have to see how things develop but hopefully it wont have a negative influence on regulators said the head of credit derivatives at a European bank who declined to be named Regulators are concerned in particular about legal risk Bank of England deputy governor David Clementi said last month question marks existed over whether players had conflicting views on details of credit derivative deals they entered into and how the law courts would treat agreements such as credit default swaps A default swap is an insurancelike instrument which allows an investor to hedge exposure to the risk of an issuer defaulting on an underlying bond or loan In the UBS case the Swiss bank alleges Deutsche Bank is in default of its obligations to pay the sum of million in a default swap deal designed to pay if US building materials firm Armstrong World Industries Inc defaulted on its debt According to documents filed at the High Court UBS alleges written confirmation of the swap contract with Deutsche mistakenly lists AWIs parent Armstrong Holdings as the underlying issuer not AWI UBS alleges the true contract related to AWI which filed for Chapter protection from creditors more than half a year after the swap deal was transacted and not to Armstrong Holdings which has not filed for Chapter and has not defaulted Both banks have declined to comment on the lawsuit but credit derivative traders have been quick to reject any suggestion that the legal action supports the argument for harsher regulatory treatment of default swaps Disagreements between counter parties over the interpretation of what constitutes a default event have resulted in court action on a number of occasions In a notable case last year involving the US insurer Conseco counterparties disagreed over whether the insurers restructuring of debt constituted a default event The market is a relatively new industry and regulators are concerned some aspects of it like contract documentation have not been fully standardised leaving participants open to the risk of contractual disputes Banks and ISDA have worked to improve documentation ISDA is currently trying to nail down a definitive description of debt restructuring which has proven a particularly tricky issue While some market participants fear the market may be harmed by fallout from legal actions other experts in the sector are more sanguine The momentum of the credit derivative market is such that it will require more than these small problems to stop the market growing said Jonathan Davies head of credit derivatives at PricewaterhouseCoopers Thesetypes of cases made firms address the issues involved Davies said adding It brings the products to the attention of senior management and accelerates the evolution of the market The New Forecast For Meteorologists Its Raining Job Offers The Wall Street Journal March By Chip Cummins Two years ago Bradley Hoggatt was heading for an academic career in meteorology intent on discovering more about how hurricanes form But just before he started working on a doctorate a very different opportunity blew in Now Mr Hoggatt forecasts weather for a floor full of MBAs who trade billions of dollars in weathersensitive energy commodities such as natural gas and electricity for Aquila Inc the trading subsidiary of a big Midwest utility With no business background himself Mr Hoggatt is also trading complex financial contracts based on his predictions Im putting my money where my mouth is says the tall squareshouldered yearold Weathermen and women have become a hot commodity in the exploding energytrading business While offtarget forecasts on television may frustrate parents and schools and embarrass politicians as they did this week on the East Coast they can lose bundles for electricity and naturalgas traders So as trading has boomed so has demand for trained meteorologists a profession that traditionally hasnt paid all that well and is often the butt of jokes From Wall Street to Houstons Louisiana Street where many energy companies have set up shop recent graduates are earning twice what they would earn at the National Weather Service or in academia The appetite for weather is insatiable says James L Gooding director of meteorology at Duke Energy Corp A former NASA scientist Dr Gooding will be adding a fourth forecaster to his Houston team in the next year Enron Corp an energytrading giant based in Houston has more than doubled its staff of weather forecasters to nine in the past three years plucking talent from places like the Weather Channel Williams Cos a Tulsa Okla competitor is endowing university fellowships to lure meteorology students And since Aquila which is owned by UtiliCorp United Inc of Kansas City Mo has hired two other meteorologists from Mr Hoggatts alma mater the University of Wisconsin plus another scientist with a PhD in climatology That hiring paid off a bit during this weeks winter storm in the Northeast While many on the East Coast were getting miscues from TV weathermen on a pending possibly historic blizzard that fizzled in New York and other cities traders at Aquila simply looked to Mr Hoggatt Last Friday Scott Macrorie an electricity trader for the MidAtlantic region at Aquila stopped by to see how the storm was progressing Mr Hoggatts team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be lower because of the storm though the snowfall forecast on TV seemed a little high Sure enough temperatures fell and snowfall in many cities was less than predicted lifting electricity prices and making Mr Macrorie a profit that he says was in the tens of thousands of dollars About university students in the US graduate each year with bachelors degrees in meteorology according to the American Meteorological Society An additional or so graduate with masters degrees or doctorates Until just a few years ago those graduates didnt typically have many options TV for those who had the blowdried look backoffice jobs with the government or a handful of private consultants for those who didnt Research was an option And some airlines and utilities kept a few meteorologists on staff to help position airplanes or powerline repair trucks during storms Now deeppocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with graduate degrees salaries ranging from to Performance and trading bonuses can double or even triple the figure That compares with the roughly the National Weather Service pays a junior forecaster with a graduate degree Its a bit unusual for meteorologists to have the prospect of lucrative employment after graduation says John NielsenGammon a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas AM University This is a bit of a switch So far there has been no dearth of meteorological talent available partly because the National Weather Service wrapped up a big expansion project in the mids and slowed hiring It hires only to replace people who leave about to meteorologists a year And the highpressure world of billiondollar commodity bets isnt for everyone When Carl Altoe graduated from Penn State one of the nations top meteorology programs he got a heavy sales pitch from Enron Its quite an impressive place he says of Enrons trading floor but he wasnt sure forecasting skills alone would be enough to make the grade I would be afraid that if money wasnt made in a hurry Id be tossed says Mr Altoe who accepted a position with the National Weather Service in Marquette Mich For others having forecasts count puts a new thrill in the old art After two years as a manager at the Weather Channels Latin American division in Atlanta Jose Marquez posted his resume on an Internet job site run by the American Meteorological Society Enron called Have you heard about Enron Mr Marquez remembers being asked And I said honestly No During a visit Mr Marquez a yearold Navytrained meteorologist found Enrons trading floor exhilarating Enron courted Mr Marquez heavily tracking him down three times during his Christmas vacation in Puerto Rico Mr Marquez decided the sprawling trading floor was just the sort of active work place he was looking for Also hed be getting a to boost over his Weather Channel salary before potential bonuses from Enron Im getting more money than I would anywhere else he says Weather has long affected prices of everything from grain at Chicagos early commodity markets to the stocks of retail companies on Wall Street Jon Davis a meteorologist for Salomon Smith Barney in Chicago started forecasting the weather for agriculture traders back in But volatile energy prices have raised the stakes for forecasters who are able to gauge airconditioning use in the summer or naturalgas demand during the winter heating season Meanwhile all sorts of companies are turning to energy traders and Wall Street for weather derivatives complex contracts used to hedge financial risks associated with the weather With every passing year you do more energy and more energy Mr Davis says Despite big advances in data collection and modeling betting millions of dollars on weather forecasts can still be tricky business Shortterm forecasts are pretty good Predicting weather two weeks from now is chancy Most meteorologists get their data from the government particularly the National Weather Service Many then tweak it with their own interpretations or forecasting models Disappointed last year by poor longterm forecasts from private consultants Aquila has a contest offering to the meteorologist or team that can best predict temperatures in major US cities over the course of a year I call it the forecast bakeoff says Mr Hoggatt The high stakes also mean more pressure on forecasters WSI Corp a Billerica Mass weatherforecasting firm started an energy service last year and Jeffrey A Shorter a WSI vice president says energy clients can be less forgiving than his other clients in TV and aviation especially when the forecasts are wrong But he adds presumably more often than not were right End of ISDA Press Report for March THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF ISDAS BOARD OF

Modernization Act of CFTC Rule Proposal Would Establish ThreeTier Regulatory Regime for Markets Meyer Promotes Basel Committee Proposal CFTC Proposes Rules Implementing Commodity Futures Modernization Act of wwwcftcgov March Washington The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC today announced that it is proposing rules relating to trading facilities to implement the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of CFMA Congress on December passed and the President on December signed into law the CFMA which substantially altered the Commodity Exchange Act The CFMA amended the law to establish three categories of markets designated contract markets derivative transaction execution facilities and markets exempt from CFTC regulation The three categories match the degree of regulation to the varying nature of the products and the nature of the participant having access to the market The proposed new rules and rule amendments are being published in the Federal Register for a day comment period The Commission in its Federal Register notice urges commenters to submit their comments as early as possible during the comment period so that the statutory changes may be effectuated without delay Acting Chairman Newsome stated Todays release of these proposed revisions is an important step in fulfilling Congresss mandate to implement the CFMAs provisions without delay We look forward to a productive discussion of this release over the next days Copies of these documents can be obtained by contacting the Office of the Secretariat Three Lafayette Centre st Street NW Washington DC or by accessing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission website CFTC Rule Proposal Would Establish ThreeTier Regulatory Regime for Markets BNA March The Commodity Futures Trading Commission began the task of implementing the Commodity Futures Modernization Act CFMA by proposing a set of rules March aimed at making the commission more of an oversight agency than a frontline regulator The rule proposal would implement the new statutory framework establishing three new market categories including exempt markets and two categories of markets subject to CFTC regulatory oversight The remaining parts of the framework relating to clearing organizations and to intermediaries will be reproposed shortly the agency stated Core Principles The proposal establishes what the CFTC deems core principles that the exchanges would operate under It is meant to replace a onesizefitsall regulatory scheme that critics say hampers the US markets by making them overencumbered and ploddingunable to compete with a fastshifting international marketplace Now the exchanges will be segregated according to who trades on them and what is sold with varying degrees of oversight for the different tiers The hope is that the exchanges with the most sophisticated traders will be able to govern their own houses with the CFTC staying clear of most regulation The proposals effectively replace rules that were passed in December but that were rendered moot and withdrawn when Congress later that month passed similar legislation In effect the proposed rules establish three tiers of oversight for the various futures and options markets designated contract markets derivatives transaction execution facilities and exempt markets The designated contract markets are approved boards of trade or trading facilities on which contracts for future delivery on any commodity may be traded by any type of market participant according to the CFTCs Federal Register notice The next tier would consist of derivatives transaction execution facilities and would be open to traders of futures and option contracts on commodities that have a nearly inexhaustible delivery supply are highly unlikely to be susceptible to manipulation have no cash market and are security futures products This tier would have an intermediate level of oversight according to the proposal Finally commercial markets and boards of trade would be exempt signifying their relative sophistication in the markets Comments on the proposal are due days after Federal Register publication Innovation Competition The announcement makes clear the CFTCs intention to go from frontline regulator to a more behindthescenes oversight role Since his appointment acting Chairman James Newsome has stressed his belief in freemarket principles and the idea that freeing the exchanges from overzealous oversight would help them compete in the global marketplace In its release the commission said the proposal was intended to promote innovation maintain US competitiveness and at the same time reduce systemic risk and protect customers The commission also said the proposal would allow US exchanges greater flexibility in competing with technological innovations involving foreign competitors The proposal is the first portion of the CFMA to be taken up by the commission The legislation was passed in the waning moments of the previous Congress and it promises to drive much of the commissions agenda this year Meyer Promotes Basel Committee Proposal BNA March By Richard Cowden Addressing a group of banking officials in Washington DC March Federal Reserve Governor Laurence H Meyer actively promoted the new approach to international banking regulation represented by the recent proposal for major revisions to the Basel Accord In remarks to the Institute of International Bankers Meyer at once conceded that the Jan proposal by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is still very much a work in progress with important issues still unresolved while defending it as a necessary initiative to keep up with the times The Basel Accord has served its purpose Meyer said But technology and business practices have moved on and for the larger institutions this decadeold rule has developed critical shortcomings Riskmeasurement practices have improved and capital markets have become more tightly intertwined Assumptions and shortcuts taken in the current accord are far too crude given practices today A new regimen for setting international capital standards is needed he said because many large complex financial institutions today structure portfolios to arbitrage around the existing standard undercutting one of the original intents of the Basel Accord to establish capital ratios that reflect a banks actual strength Thus we need a capital framework that is more risksensitive and compatible with current market practices Meyer said Absolute levels of capital must be consistent with risk in order not to shift risktaking either away from or to banks but we also need a standard that better reflects relative levels of risk Meyer outlined the Basel Committees proposal which relies on a threepillar approach involving a new capital standard heightened supervisory review of banks own internal assessments of their capital ratios and increased public disclosures of risk portfolios The new proposal in effect increases the emphasis on the supervisors oversight of the institutions economic capital needs as it refines the calculation of the regulatory minimum he said Backs Controversial Pillar One of the innovative features of the proposal is that it would give banks the option of developing their own internal models for calculating capital adequacy Meyer said However such methods are expected to rely heavily on proper supervision During a recent meeting of the Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee this pillar of the Basel Committee proposal was called into question as a factor that could be compromised by pressures on individual national supervisory authorities Meyer said for someand perhaps for manysupervisors abroad implementing pillar will be an even greater challenge and a more significant event potentially introducing a material change in their role For all of us though it is the right approachrelying more than before on the internal measures and management practices of banks giving them more incentives to invest in better information systems and controls In regard to disclosure issues Meyer acknowledged the formative nature of the proposal He said we recognized that we still have more work to do in fashioning a more disciplined and prioritized set of disclosure requirements one that balances the cost of compliance against the benefits of disclosure This is an area in which bank comments on the Basel Committees proposal would be particularly helpful Jochen Sanio president of the Federal Banking Supervisory Office of Germany called the proposed revision of the Basel Accord a radical departure from a conventional approach to international banking regulation that relies almost entirely on standards that are set by regulators He predicted the new Basel Accord will take effect early in Basel II is not the end of the story Basel II is a first step a very big step forward but the revolution to quote Trotsky the revolution will be a permanent one And after Basel II there will be Basel III and IV And thats when we will talk about credit risk models I am convinced it will take the academics only some years to really perfect credit risk modeling and then it will be accepted Scott Marra Administrator for Policy Media Relations ISDA Fifth Avenue Rockefeller Center th floor New York NY Phone Fax Email

Basel Rqmts Now Dow Jones A ragbag of reform The Economist No taste for risk Are markets rejecting their traditional role Financial Times SEC to toughen reports scrutiny Financial Times March By John Labate Securities regulators in the US plan to step up their scrutiny of company financial reports in response to changes in economic and corporate conditions The move comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC finds its accounting review resources freed up by the slowdown in filings for initial public offerings that were once the agencys main target Last year companies faced a onein chance of being reviewed by SEC accountants but the aim this year is to review as many as one in three reports The change could mean companies face tougher inspection on a range of accounting issues that in the past might have gone unnoticed Among the issues to get a heightened review are revenue disclosures credit risk reporting hedging techniques and derivatives exposures SEC enforcement officials are also expected to raise their surveillance of financial fraud as new trends in manipulation of earnings have begun to emerge Annual reports are more likely to be selected for review this year said Robert Bayless chief accountant at the SECs division of corporate finance Were returning to the historical norm after a twoyear period of focusing on initial public offering issues In the last five years some of the biggest financial frauds have been uncovered against companies such as Cendant and McKesson HBOC Tens of billions of dollars in market value have been lost as a result SEC officials have disclosed that more than financial fraud investigations are under way and that more highprofile cases are likely to be announced soon We are finding more ingenious ways that revenues are being improperly enhanced said Charles Niemeier chief accountant at the SECs division of enforcement Another area of investigation involves corporate earnings warnings and how long a company might wait before disclosing news to investors One unnamed company being investigated is said to have waited nine months before revealing a warning Few Banks Could Meet New Basel Rqmts Now Dow Jones March By Jonathan Nicholson WASHINGTON Dow Jones Federal Reserve Gov Laurence Meyer on Monday criticized the internal riskassessment capabilities of US banks Meyer in prepared remarks to be delivered to a meeting of the Institute of International Bankers here also said few US banks would qualify now for the relaxed treatment proposed under a new international agreement on how banks are regulated That proposed update to the socalled Basel Capital Accord is expected to be effective in Meyers prepared remarks didnt touch on monetary policy or the economic outlook The proposed update to the Basel Accord was released in January It calls for a threepronged approach to bank regulation involving a new capital standard increased scrutiny of a banks own internal assessment of its capital levels and increased disclosure of risks to the marketplace Banks would be allowed to use an internal ratingsbased approach for some capital requirements But Meyer said that would only work for banks with good riskmeasuring capabilities As bankers you should ask yourselves whether you are truly ready The quick answer were there is probably wrong Meyer said Based on our examinations of US banks internal riskrating processes I suspect that few banks would or should get a clean signoff from their supervisor today Meyer said banks have been surprisingly slow to link acceptable credit risks and assessments of capital adequacy he said The processes banks use to make internal grades of credit risks are also lacking he said Most significantly the rigor and internal consistency of the internal riskrating process is often handicapped by insufficient or unclear rating criteria or by limited resources dedicated to independent reviews of riskrating assignments he said Meyer urged banks to comment on the proposal now while it is still undergoing development Once adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision it will be submitted to the central banks of the worlds largest economic powers Meyer said After that in the US it will go through the usual rulemaking process The proposal may be complex and at times confusing but I believe we are on the right track We need regulatory capital standards that are far more risk sensitive than the one we have now and that provide the industry greater incentives to measure and manage risk he said A ragbag of reform The Economist March Across Europes financial markets lies a colourful patchwork of regulation In Austria a government department watches over the markets a task that the Irish leave to their central bank The French have two main regulators for their markets while the Germans have three With many countries still separating the regulation of banks insurers and securities firms there are about different authorities currently tying up EU member states with red tape These old structures however are changing The British set a brand new example last year when they introduced a single allpowerful regulator the Financial Services Authority FA to watch over all their financial markets And in February an influential EU group of wise men headed by Alexandre Lamfalussy a former chairman of the EMI forerunner of the European Central Bank endorsed the British model and recommended a single national regulator for each EU country That led some to wonder whether whats good for Britain might be good for Europe too Would the EU benefit from having a single superregulator The Lamfalussy group says that a single authority in each member state would bring economies of scale more streamlined management greater transparency and clearer accountability Most EU countries say they are heading towards that goal though so far only Denmark and Sweden have gone as far as Britain Belgium Luxembourg and Finland have merged the supervision of securities and banking but in seven EU countries a separate institution still regulates the securities markets The main motive for reform is clear a broader constituency for each regulator is expected to reduce the inefficiencies in Europes fragmented financial markets This fragmentation diminishes the depth and liquidity of the markets and makes the cost of capital in Europe persistently higher than it is in America It also makes it more difficult for entrepreneurs to find startup funds Per head of population there is five times as much venture capital available in America as there is in Europe America has one national regulator for its securities marketsthe Securities and Exchange Commission SEC But it has several regulators for other parts of the financial system The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation the Federal Reserve Board and the various state banking commissions all keep an eye on banks while state insurance commissions regulate insurance firms The regime is a mix of monopoly and fragmentation Debate on the reform of financial regulation in America has emerged at irregular intervals usually after the shock of a financial scandal Whenever something goes seriously wrongthe stock market crash in the collapse of the notorious Bank of Credit and Commerce International or the crash of LongTerm Capital Management in reform of financial regulation is hotly debated Until now though no evidently superior solution for the regulatory conundrum has prevailed So each country has been left to devise its own system American markets have by and large pioneered those developments in recent years that have made the regulators job much tougherrapid innovation internationalisation and the broadening range of businesses in which individual firms take part But none of these has led to radical reform The American regulatory system has not changed fundamentally since when the SEC was set up Two heads better than one Discussion of regulatory reform in Europe has a shorter history Most European regulators have not been established for long and change in financial markets has been slower than in America The pressure for reform has accelerated with the recent introduction of the single European currency and with technological progress The euro in effect a single financial market for cash has integrated national bond markets in the euro area and has begun to do the same for equities Investment managers now do their research on European bonds and equities by sector rather than by country At the same time changes in technology have replaced many of the old highdecibel trading floors with electronic trading platforms Supervising such markets is forcing regulators to rethink their traditional methods of regulation The British government eager to preserve the City of Londons leading role in financial services announced a reform of its system of regulation in For years the City had policed itself with selfregulatory organisations that covered both wholesale and retail financial services After a protracted debate about the wisdom of merging all these bodies into one supersupervisor the British parliament finally passed the unwieldy Financial Services and Markets Bill last year It is this legislation that established the pioneering FSA The idea of a single regulator is now spreading across Europe Hans Eichel the German finance minister wants to merge his countrys three regulatory bodies one each for banks insurers and securities houses into one Federal Agency for Financial Market Supervision However his plan is unpopular with state governments always sensitive to incursions into their prerogatives At the moment they oversee Germanys eight bourses the government of Hesse keeps an eye on the Frankfurt stock exchange for example while BadenWrttemberg watches over the bourse in Stuttgart The French too are talking about merging their regulators Frances main supervisory authority is the Commission des Operations de Bourse COB but it shares responsibility with two other bodies the Conseil des Marchs Financiers a self regulatory organisation that oversees market transactions and the Commission Bancaire the watchdog for the banking industry The French government is a strong proponent of the socalled twin heads model of regulationhaving one regulator for prudential supervision and wholesale business the markets for financial products between professionals and one for the retail markets where financial products are sold to consumers The head of the COB Michel Prada says that two separate regulatory bodies are preferable to one for two main reasons In the first place they reduce the risk of the retail market regulator being contaminated by its wholesale counterpart and vice versa And secondly they reduce the huge management burden that is imposed on a single regulator The COB has fewer than staff the FSA has around The EUS bureaucrats have been pursuing reform for much longer than their national counterpartsand with little to show for it so far In theory EU financial markets were supposed to be one single market from the first day of Remember the single market programme of directives At the time many of the measures that were required to create a single market in financial services together with more streamlined regulation were put in place Restrictions on capital movements had been largely dismantled and the European Commission had launched a series of passport directives designed to let banks insurers and stockbrokers offer their services directly across borders without setting up local subsidiaries All was in place for the single market in financial services to take off In practice however member states delayed the implementation of the directives or did not implement the bits that they did not like At first the commission reacted timidly to their recalcitrance setting up a feeble Forum of European Securities Commissions FEC in to promote cooperation among securities regulators FESCOs work has been inconsequential though largely because it does not have any official status It is further handicapped by being obliged to work by consensus and by being unable to make recommendations that are binding In the aftermath of the launch of the euro Europes leaders decided to take more robust action to tackle other financial markets They endorsed the European Commissions Financial Services Action Plan FSAP at their Lisbon summit in March a blueprint for integrated capital and financialservices markets across the EU The FAP recommends measures to streamline the regulation of retail and wholesale financial markets The latest deadline for their implementation is Not content with this deadline nor with the contents of the plan the French government decided to try both to tinker with it and to speed it up In the second half of last year when France held the presidency of the Council of Ministers Laurent Fabius the French finance minister suggested setting up a small committee to study the possibility of a more radical plan In it he wanted to include the establishment of a panEuropean regulator to be headquartered not surprisingly in Paris Britain was staunchly opposed to the setting up of such a committee and tried unsuccessfully to block it To calm Britains worries a British treasury official Sir Nigel Wicks was made a member of the committee that was eventually formed under Mr Lamfalussys chairmanship It produced an interim report last November and a final report in midFebruary Competing visions Despite all this activity neither national governments nor policymakers in Brussels have made up their minds about the best form of financial regulation for Europe Most EU member states now consider a single supervisor for all financial services to be the best solution within their own domain although there are those who want to keep regulation of the wholesale market apart from regulation of the retail side By the same token a panEuropean regulator would seem to be the most efficient way to put an end to Europes regulatory ragbag Yet the idea of competition between different jurisdictions offering their own brand of regulation has its supporters While the French campaign for a single European regulator Britains chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown is fiercely opposed to the idea The Germans are also in favour of a panEuropean regulator though they are less keen than the French Caio KochWeser a state secretary at the German finance ministry has said that at some stage a panEuropean regulator will be on the agenda By reforming its regulatory setup his country is to foreshadow that development Mr Lamfalussys group stops short of proposing a single regulator or even twin heads for the whole of the EUalthough its recommended creation of a securities committee to speed up the Eus cumbersome legislative procedures has been seen by some as an embryonic SEC This is an openended process says Mr Lamfalussy His committees report has only proposed measures that it thinks can be implemented in the next few years Mr Lamfalussy is he concedes a federalistbut a pragmatic one His group was not asked to come up with a counterproposal to the commissions FSAP Rather it was expected to highlight the most urgent measures needed to streamline the regulation of securities markets in the EU Hence the groups final report focuses on the modernisation of rules for investment and pension funds on the adoption of international accounting standards and on a single passport for stockmarkets Mr Lamfalussy wants all these reforms implemented by although he admits it will be tricky Other priorities on the list are less controversiala single prospectus for issuers the principle of mutual recognition for wholesale markets and the modernisation of exchanges listing requirements Ironically many of the groups recommendations have been under discussion for years or are in some cases already part of an EU directive Many of these proposals however came out halfbaked The key investmentservices directive for instance which sets conditions for a single EUwide license for investment firms and which empowers stock exchanges to operate across borders was watered down and implemented belatedly Although the directive was approved in after three years of tortuous wrangling many governments waited until to implement it In order to get it approved at all the commission had to tolerate many ambiguities in the text For instance something as basic as the definition of a professional investor is unclear Mr Lamfalussy makes much of the damage that has been done by the delays in tack ling what he calls priority measures National governments still stick to protectionist investment rules for investment and pension funds for example The Italian government requires that pension funds invest a considerable portion of the money that they manage in government bonds And multi national companies are obliged to run a different pension plan for their employees in each member state of the union As a result the average American investment fund is six times bigger than its European equivalent and between and the average real return on pension funds was in America and in EU countries that impose strict restrictions The people who suffer most from Europes protectionist rules are pensioners themselves And as more and more of them come to rely on privatesector schemes their loss will be even greater Mr Lamfalussy is also concerned about the damage that is being done by the continuing failure of most EU member countries to introduce rules on disclosure comparable to American standards This failure means that investors in the EU are not properly protected For instance information on the stock options granted to the directors of Lernout Hauspie a troubled Belgian company developing speechrecognition technology could only be found at the SECS EDGAR an electronic register in America that gathers and analyses data on companies flies Even the Belgian authorities that are investigating Lernout for allegedly inventing revenues had to turn to the SEC for help Karel Lannoo at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels is among those in favour of introducing a European EDGAR once the single European prospectus is a reality and once EU accounting standards are more homogeneous Almost stronger than the Lamfalussy committees desire to give new impetus to proposals for reform that in many cases have been discussed for years is its desire to accelerate decisionmaking procedures within the EU and to control more tightly the implementation of directives by member states At present the commission makes a legislative proposal to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament They then shunt it around in a complex codecision procedure that takes on average more than two years The takeover directive has been in the works for years and has still not been adopted while the European company statute has been discussed on and off for more than years Mr Lamfalussy calls for a fourlevel approach to decisionmaking and the implementation of financialmarket proposals At the first level the Council of Ministers the European Commission and the European Parliament would agree on framework legislation and would decide which of the measures to be implemented should be passed to the next level At this second level a newly created securities committee made up of representatives of the commission and of member states would reach agreement within three months on the technicalities of the new legislation This they would do after consulting market participants and consumers The government representatives on the securities committee should be just under the finance minister says Mr Lamfalussy Predictably the idea of such a committee has aroused the wrath of the European Parliament It worries that the committee will be come a means for removing important decisions from democratic accountability Levels three and four of the Lamfalussy approach to decisionmaking involve cooperation among national regulators via a regulators committee Its purpose will be to improve the implementation of EU legislation by the better enforcement of EU rules The timetable for the Lamfalussy plan is ambitious It is to be debated by the European Parliament in midMarch where it is unlikely to have a comfortable ride and it will then come before the European Council at its meeting in Stockholm at the end of March There the list of priorities in the plan is due to get the communitys stamp of approval The commission is then to begin setting up the securities committee and the regulators committee in April and May and by December the two committees should be in operation All Mr Lamfalussys recommendations are due to be implemented by a year earlier than the deadline of the commissions own action plan This is ambitious Even if Mr Lamfalussys fourlevel approach is simpler than the Kafkaesque co decision procedure currently in place it is still a complicated structure Moreover some of the measures on his priority list such as the move to international accounting standards are very likely to take more than two years to implement The role of the regulator The debate about financialmarket regulation in Europe has moved from considering the merits of selfregulation versus statutory regulation to whether a single regulator should police all financial services The Lamfalussy report has done nothing to help resolve this dilemma Financial regulation exists for three main reasons It is there to provide a safety net that will prevent the collapse of one bank insurer or investment manager triggering the failure of others It is also there to supervise the integrity of financial institutions and to protect individual consumers from malpractice and fraud And it is there to act as the watchdog of financial markets policing insider dealing malpractice and other offences If it is tricky for a single national authority to combine these different objectives of regulation it is even harder for a supranational regulator How can a single organisation hope to protect investors police financial institutions and watch markets in different jurisdictions Even if it were desirable to try some form of common jurisdiction would be essential On top of everything else a regulator has to be firm and effective to gain credibility If the EUS track record in enforcing its directives on financial regulation is anything to go by a pan European regulator would be neither No taste for risk Are markets rejecting their traditional role Financial Times March By Philip Coggan The collapse of Barings the Asian financial crisis of the dotcom mania of these events have created the idea that the financial markets are a Frankensteins monster wreaking havoc on the societies that created them Not so according to the author of this polemic Far from being a giant casino the financial system has become obsessed with controlling risk at the expense of fulfilling its proper function providing capital for business As a consequence the era of financial growth has coincided with that of a secular economic slowdown This is at the very least a refreshingly different take on the events of the past years The world in the authors view has too few risktakers not too many And Mr BenAmi assembles some solid building blocks for his case He points out quite rightly that equity markets have been taken over by fund managers who are obsessed with the business risk of matching the index and their peers rather than achieving the maximum return Banks have retreated from their function of providing risk capital to business in favour of the feeearning function of arranging bond issues The rise of the derivatives industry illustrates the extent to which companies and financial professionals have become obsessed with the aim of avoiding risk whether it comes in the form of interest rate and currency movements or changes in the weather BenAmi also points out that in the US and the UK at least stock markets have almost ceased to perform the function of providing capital to business In net terms capital has been returned to investors in the form of takeovers and share buybacks But just when you feel Mr BenAmi has the basis of a good case nagging doubts start to enter your mind How is he going to deal with the rise of the venture capital industry Or with the use of share options to motivate executives Or with the growth of day trading The answer is that he doesnt really address those issues In fact the case that the financial system is starving industry of funds has been made at various times over the last century but it has been extremely difficult to prove It seems a particularly ropey argument when one considers the events of the last decade Arguably the financial system was ludicrously keen to fund anyone with a laptop and a new economy idea the economy may now face a crisis of overinvestment There has been no shortage of funds for startups The amount of money invested by US venture capital groups rose from Dollars bn in to Dollars bn in And established groups have had no problems raising capital either international bond issuance in reached a record high of Dollars bn Arguably the decline of government bond issuance thanks to the improved finances of European and US governments has freed capital for industry It is also pretty hard to argue that risktaking in society has declined when one recalls how many executives and employees have left established companies for dotcom startups over the last couple of years Old economy businesses have also been happy to gear up taking on extra debt either through management buyouts or to increase the return on equity and satisfy the stock market Individuals have also been happy to take on greater debt in the UK and the US and to put a greater proportion of savings into equities albeit via collective schemes such as mutual funds Neither development suggests a riskaverse culture And while enthusiasm for developments such as online trading and spread betting may be confined to a small minority it still points to the existence of a strong gambling mentality Arguably the long bull market has blinded investors to the risks inherent in equity investment rather than making them too cautious It is also pretty hard looking at the record of the US over the last five years to say that economic growth has been sluggish One can argue about some of the productivity statistics and about the causes of the improvement but the US has nevertheless grown faster at a lower unemployment level and with scarcely any inflationary pressure than most economists would have thought possible a few years ago Mr BenAmis case might make more sense applied to Europe or the UK but the US is at the heart of financial market change if this thesis doesnt work there it doesnt work at all In short the author makes a much better case for the defence of the financial system than he does when attacking its pusillanimity Scott Marra Administrator for Policy Media Relations ISDA Fifth Avenue Rockefeller Center th floor New York

Passes Bankruptcy Reform BNA Whats A Default Derivatives Strategy Derivatives Give Extra Nudge To Falling Nikkei Reuters Fed Study Hints Credit Risks Correlation Should Tighten Dow Jones March NEW YORK Dow Jones Banks should be prepared to tighten the coordination between credit risks they are exposed to in different markets as they adapt to the changing requirements of the Basel Accord on capital requirements a Federal Reserve study says Specifically the report cites exposure to derivatives as one area where broader and more tightly integrated models of credit risk are likely to be a future requirement for banks Especially in such cases of positions that involve derivatives banks credit risk models should reflect not only the uncertainty in future exposures but also the potential correlation of exposures across credits the paper says The New York Federal Reserve study entitled Using Credit Risk Models For Regulatory Capital Issues And Options is for future publication in a forthcoming Economic Policy Review The goal of this paper is to generate discussion and air alternative scenarios among regulators and among banks as they adapt their credit risk models in future said a coauthor of the report Beverly Hirtle vice president at the New York Federal Reserve for banking studies speaking with Dow Jones Newswires Wednesday Other coauthors were Mark Levonian a director in the Banking Supervision and Regulation Division at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Marc Saidenberg a Bank Supervision officer and Stefan Walter a vice president at the New York Fed and David Wright an assistant director of the Banking Supervision and Regulation Division at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System When questioned Hirtle said the studys reference to derivatives and to the possible need for some banks to tighten correlations among different instruments of credit risk going forward wasnt based on specific events or problems in the financial sector Derivatives exposures were one factor that made a number of banks and companies vulnerable to financial shocks during the s including Barings Bank German company Metallgesellschaft Japans Sumitomo Bank and the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management For positions that involve derivatives or that otherwise depend to a material extent on market factors standards likely would require integrated models of market movements and credit exposures the report said Unlike exposures to loans exposures to derivatives can change more rapidly Hirtle said Correlating Different Loans Is Key Hirtle stressed the importance of banks correlating the levels of credit risk among loans to different borrowers When a loan to a particular borrower has a rating in a banks internal ratings system and the bank then decides that loan is is better or worse than previously then if you looked across all of the loans in a banks books that tends to mean other credits are also being downgraded or upgraded Hirtle said That correlation is a very important factor in the risks facing banks and one which many banks are already aware of Hirtle added She also gave an example in general terms of how a chain of events might lower the worth of a credit for a bank A firm might be downgraded by a credit ratings agency and they might draw down on a line of credit from a bank so the banks exposure goes up and the value of the loan goes down Hirtle said Thats an example of how three factors can move against a bank at the same time she added Banks adaptation of their internal controls to monitor risk will be partly driven by changes to an international agreement on the subject The coming revisions to the Basel Accord planned for introduction by aim to update the way that banks globally account for risk The new version of that agreement will likely incorporate a greater reliance on banks internal risk rating systems in assessing regulatory minimum capital requirements the Fed paper said Derivatives Give Extra Nudge to Falling Nikkei Reuters English News Service By Risa Maeda A plunge in the Tokyo stock market partly reflects hedge selling related to equity derivatives products analysts said on Friday forecasting more such sales ahead if the benchmark Nikkei average crumbles further Selling related to derivatives products mainly structured bonds with returns linked to the Nikkeis level has gathered steam since the Nikkei dipped below the analysts said On Friday it stood at a year low The so called Nikkeilinked bonds have grown especially popular in the last two years as cashrich individual investors hunger for returns beyond current rockbottom interest rates offered by conventional government debt Financial Services Minister Hakuo Yanagisawa said on Friday that the recent sharp drop in share prices was due in part to trading in equity derivatives products Equity derivatives products have been accelerating the decline in Japans stock market Yanagisawa said Nobuaki Kurisu chief fund manager at Sumisei Global Investment Trust Management also cited derivatives related selling as a factor in the stock markets plunge and added that such selling should keep market volatility high for the time being making institutional investors hesitant to buy Analysts said speculators have been selling Nikkei futures contracts in the past weeks trying to nudge the Nikkei average to predetermined levels that will in turn trigger hedgerelated selling Many of the trigger points were believed to be set at or below THE RUSH TO HEDGE Equity linked derivative bonds which usually mature in six months to one year offer higher interest rates than ordinary bonds if the Nikkei stays above a predetermined level But once the Nikkei drops below that level the return at the bonds maturity will be lower than the initial investment This causes brokers to hedge by lightening existing long positions or selling in the market Arrangers of these products have to sell either Nikkei futures or a basket of Nikkei component stocks to hedge and there are more trigger points if the average dips to and further to said Hirokazu Kabeya analyst at Daiwa Institute of Research He said up to billion yen million worth of these bonds have been launched at each of three different preset Nikkei levels between and between and and between and Another equity derivatives product which has attracted retail investors over the past two years has been exchangeable bonds EBs often linked with the stock prices of bluechip hightech issues such as Sony Corp and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp NTT EBs are automatically redeemed if the value of a selected stock rises above a predetermined price If the value falls below the predetermined price as has often been the case recently the EBs are redeemed with stock certificates carrying latent losses causing many investors to unload the unwanted certificates in an already bearish market Yen House Passes Bankruptcy Reform BNA March By Adam Walsh Three years in the making sweeping bankruptcy reform legislation HR passed the House March sending waves of contentment through much of the financial services sector and the ranks of Republicans none of whom voted to oppose the measure In the end Democrats crossed party lines to support the bill which has moved through the House before only to be pocket vetoed by former President Clinton last year The majority of Democrats opposed the measure deploring it for its treatment of lower and middleincome Americans who depend upon bankruptcy to achieve a fresh start A Democratic replacement amendment which Rep F James Sensenbrenner Jr RWis said would eviscerate the present bill was defeated Also the House moved to defeat a motion by Rep John Conyers DMich the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee to recommit the bill back to committee Conyers proposed a measure limiting the marketing of credit cards to those who are under This bill seeks to restore personal responsibility and integrity to the bankruptcy system and ensure these laws are fair to both debtor and creditors Sensenbrenner said following the bills passage Abuse of the current systemestimated to cost the rest of us approximately billion each yearis the driving force behind this bipartisan balanced and comprehensive legislation In a statement Edward L Yingling executive director of the American Bankers Association said ABA is very pleased to see bankruptcy reform pass the House today by such a broad bipartisan margin Saying the current bankruptcy code permits individuals with higher incomes to walk away from debts he called bankruptcy reform an urgent matter because the system is broken and needs to be fixed In general HR and S its companion bill in the Senate seek to force more bankruptcy filers to file under Chapter which requires some repayment of debts instead of Chapter which discharges most debts Means Test Main Feature of Measure Before moving off the House floor three substantive amendments were made to HR in addition to one technical amendment The first which passed by voice vote and was offered by Rep Sheila JacksonLee DTexas adds a debtors monthly public school expenses as an allowable expense under the bills means test and puts public school expenses on an equal footing with that of private school expenses which is already included in the bill The means test is the reform measures primary feature It is designed to serve as a kind of calculation device to determine who can file under Chapter and who can file under Chapter A second and third amendment also passed by voice vote Offered by Rep Mark Green RWis the second amendment would remove the names of children from bankruptcy filings in order to shield minors from wouldbe predators The final substantive amendment offered jointly by Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael Oxley ROhio and the committees ranking member Rep John J LaFalce DNY aims to reduce uncertainty and limit systemic risk in the banking system by simplifying the terms for settling large financial contracts in the event that one counterparty becomes insolvent Former House Banking Committee Chairman James A Leach RIowa rose to support the bill citing this sole amendment as reason enough to do so A similar amendment was made to the legislation during markup in the Senate Judiciary Committee Feb Both amendments conform legal definitions throughout the body of law that cover the bankruptcy of large financial institutions House Majority Leader Dick Armey RTexas rose to support the bill saying it was a matter of enormous pride that the House adopt bankruptcy reform legislation Rep Mel Watt DNC took a different view alleging that the bill was the result of special interests At the end of the day this bill will not be amended because it is a political statement Watt said on the floor People who wanted this bill knew that they could not get it unless they exempted the poorest people from the system Watt referred to a portion of the bills means test that exempts wage earners who make less than half of their states median income The establishment of two classes of debtorsone poorer and one richerwould be the lasting legacy of this bill Watt said Rep Jerrold Nadler DNY called the bill a poster child for campaign reform legislation Commenting on the House rule that limited debate on HR Rep Adam Schiff DCalif said the House was delegating its legislative responsibilities to the Senate The bill now must wait until the Senate passes its version before a conference can be appointed to work out differences between the two bills see related report in this section Whats a default Derivatives Strategy February By Barclay T Leib Credit derivatives only came into existence in the latter half of the Os and the documentation behind the product has been lightly tested But on September last fall some credit derivatives traders got a rude wakeup call That was the day Bank of America and Chase announced the extension of billion in loans to the troubled Conseco Corp While this helped Conseco avoid an immediate bankruptcy declaration and sent the companys bonds modestly higher the loan extension was technically deemed a restructuring As such it was also deemed a credit eventwhich allowed some fastfooted dealers to deliver longdated Conseco securities against credit default swap agreements Bonds that had previously been trading at a handle could suddenly be tendered at par Since credit default events had been rare to that point Rite Aid Armstrong Corp and schoolbus manufacturer Laidlaw being the only three highprofile examplesseveral banks were caught completely offguard by the Conseco situation I think there was a gentlemans perception that this loan restructuring should not have caused a default trigger even though the nittygritty of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association document clearly allowed it to be such notes a credit derivatives broker Even fewer dealers thought it was an appropriate response to get delivered longerdated paper when it was a shortterm loan that got extended Ever since the usefulness of credit default swaps has been called into question and the market has been abuzz with proposed language changes to the ISDA derivatives document For all the deal flow these days its suddenly become apparent that many people arent entirely sure what it is theyve been trading Is this a product that is supposed to pay off on credit impairment or is it a product intended to protect capital in case of a cataclysmic inability to recover ones principal Most people believe it should be the latter but the Conseco event suddenly raised disparate interests and views that previously had been shoved under the rug Tailormade contracts with specific restructuring provisionseither included or notcan always be designed and traded but suddenly no one knows what the standard documentation for the interdealer market should beand that has regulators and industry groups scrambling for answers In a research report called Restructuring A Defining Event for Synthetic CDOs dated December the rating agency Fitch even stated that recent developments may eventually necessitate changes in its rating criteria for credit derivatives and the collateralized debt obligations into which they are sometimes packaged According to Roger Merritt managing director in Fitchs global loan products group a narrower definition as to what constitutes a credit event or the complete elimination of restructuring should in fact correspond with a lower incidence of credit protection payments for synthetic CDOs and credit derivatives Important insurance Credit default swaps stipulate that in one of several possible eventsthe declaration of a bankruptcy the failure to pay interest on a loan or bond or the restructuring repudiation or acceleration of a loan that lowers the overall creditworthiness of a counterpartythe buyer of the swap may deliver to the seller any loan or bond extending out to a predefined maturity and receive back par value in return In a market where it can be difficult and timeintensive for bank portfolio managers to resell an actual loan this is an important and attractive product for lenders Although delivery is typically based on physical settlement of loans or bonds at their par value contracts are sometimes written for cash settlement of par value minus any recovery from the sale of the asset Because of the product loan portfolio managers on both sides of the Atlantic have morphed in recent years into active traders while insurance company and hedge fund managers gained a new way to position themselves Within the credit default swap contract restructuring is clearly a trigger event important to many commercial banks There are increasing pressures on banks to mark loans to market and when a loan is restructured it is clearly a loss of valueoften a step taken just to avoid an immediate default explains Hetty Harlan a managing director in charge of credit derivatives trading for BofAs portfolio management group Harlan thus considers structurings de facto or prepackaged defaults and a legitimate credit event under standard ISDA document Such loans become expensive to hang onto in terms of loan loss reserves or chargeoffs she explains so we need to have some relief at that point to help mitigate the risk of doing so Nobody wants to throw a company into bankruptcy if theres a glimmer of hope that a company may turn around with time Banks shouldnt be in a position where they have to push for default because restructuring does not qualify for relief That is in nobodys best interest Not everyone in the credit market thinks this issue is quite that simple and straightforward however According to sources close to the Conseco situation Bank of America was actually the first institution to start delivering Conseco paper against long credit default swaps it had previously purchased Harlan claims the bank only delivered the restructured loans but other sources say BofA delivered the cheapest bonds it could get its hands on Merrill Lynch quickly followed But since Bank of America also had a hand in the loan extension some cried foul at the potential conflict of interest Since the loan was renegotiated on the last day of the contract BofA certainly could have considered it a repaid loan and then extended a new loan if it had wanted to couch it in such terms says one dealer That path would have avoided the technical default In lieu of that however Bank of America termed the extension a restructuring and quickly delivered Conseco paper to get it off its books At the end of the day calling the Conseco loan a restructuring was probably the commercially normal thing for BofA to have done ventures another senior dealer It knew the implications of its actions and coincidentally was happy to benefit This is a financial market not a social club You have to have compelling bigpicture incentives for people not to do shortterm things in their economic best interest Nonetheless these events highlight a moral hazard issue and more than a few fund and insurance sellers of credit derivatives protection felt burned After all how can a bank extend a loan collect big fees for doing so then come crying to the market that they need added compensation under their credit default swaps Many think theres something fundamentally wrong here Moreover they argue if Bank of America had been short credit default swaps instead of long might it have potentially followed a different path that would have once again benefited its own book but potentially left those actually betting on a Conseco default with less satisfaction Slow down dont move too fast A s a result of this debate many USbased dealers last MOctober petitioned for the complete removal of restructuring as a trigger event in credit derivatives documentation Not long after these dealers started quoting standard credit derivative contracts with the restructuring language removed The broker market became a twotier market of credit default swaps with restructuring and without restructuring But many again cried foul I was very taken aback says BofNs Harlan A credit default swap without a trigger for restructuring is a much less valuable instrument to us By proposing such a change dealers were just trying to simplify and provide a quick fix to the problem issue But this quick fix would truly eat away at the contracts very usefulness to many buyersparticularly banks Since then Harlan has continued to insist that restructuring be included in all new contracts she enters into European credit derivative participants also balked at the new direction decided upon by their American counterparts The European capital markets contain a much higher percentage of bank loans vs bond debt and few bankers want to lose the protection of a loan restructuring clause as a trigger for credit default swaps After all isnt a loan restructuring just one step removed from outright bankruptcy And if people dont recognize it as such whats the point of buying credit protection in the first place The result to date of this Continental drift all credit derivatives transacted between US and European counterparties continue to include restructuring in the documentation But many contracts negotiated solely between US counterparties do not The credit derivatives market has effectively bifurcated itself into two distinctly different products and although it hasnt yet reached a critical stage participants are concerned that this bifurcation may start to hurt overall market liquidity Regulator warnings If the rancor from European bankers was not already loud I enough the global regulatory community also posted a strong stop sign in front of the without restructuring contracts At the ChaseDerivatives Strategy Credit Derivatives Conference in midNovember Federal Reserve Board official Thomas Boemio threw down the proverbial gauntlet If restructuring is taken out of ISDA documentation he said the Fed will ignore credit derivatives for purposes of capital relief There were loud oohs and aahs from the bankers and dealers in the audience at Boemios pronouncement After all credit derivatives were born very much to help banks satisfy Fedmandated regulatory capital requirements Take that regulatory relief away and core demand for the product would certainly be reduced Since that conference dealers have met many more times to try to hash things out ISDA executive director and CEO Bob Pickel traveled to London in early December to try to smooth the ruffled feathers of European bankers At the first of those meetings held in the stately Fleet Street offices of Goldman Sachs several European bankers explained that French regulatory officials had joined the Feds Boemio in reiterating that credit derivatives documentation needs to retain loan restructuring default clauses in order to be deemed good offset to a loan or bond position Such news caused further groans from dealing participants across the Atlantic I dont think the Fed or the Commission Banquaire the French regulator have truly thought out their position on this says one senior credit derivatives dealer at a major New York investment bank Since all bank loans can only be restructured with the percent approval of those holding these loans wheres the harm in allowing capital relief at least until such a restructuring transpires In other words if a bank has a twoyear loan covered by a twoyear credit default swap that bank would naturally agree to a loan extension only on terms attractive to it If not offered such terms it would simply demand repayment of the loan even if such demands forced the company into bankruptcy For its part the Fed seems to have larger issues of fairness and security in mind It doesnt want banks to appear to have capital protection after buying credit default swaps only to be forced to effectively abandon such protection by a corporate counterpart playing hardball in a loan renegotiation process For example would a bank give up its collection rights on a million credit default swap if it had billion in total loans that could be thrown into the nonperforming category by a bankruptcy declaration Without a hard and fast rule that a loan restructuring is a credit event it might feel obliged to do so A pendulum Over its short history credit derivatives documentation has swung from being overly vague to potentially too specific ISDAs initial credit derivative definitions drafted in as an addendum to the ISDA master derivatives document stipulated that in order to trigger a credit event the change in the terms of any loan or bond obligation had to result in terms that were materially less favorable to any holders of the obligation Many deemed this language too vague and subjective it tended to encourage litigation rather than avoid it After the turmoil surrounding Russian paper which many viewed as a default but some called a period of acute market stressthere was general agreement in to try to tighten up the documentation language Very specific definitions of a credit event were introduced Even then some participants were not fully confident of the new verbiage but after much discussion exhaustion ruled People grew so sick of the debate on restructuring that in the end it was just easiest to go with the new definitions and come back to the issue at a later date says Richard Kennaugh cohead of credit derivatives trading at Chase Securities At the time the definitions were thought to at least be better than what was used before The definitions lasted all of months before hitting their first stumbling block Now participants complain that the definition of a credit default actually became far too precise back in The Conseco situation showed how a technical default could trigger a credit derivatives exercise but without the debt of the underlying company being truly hurt At the center of the snafu is the presumption that when a bank loan is restructured all other corporate debt becomes harmed and thus due and payable Events have clearly proven otherwise not only has Conseco not fallen into bankruptcy but its various tranches of debt and bonds continue to trade at markedly different valuations in the market Almost every major institution wants some change to the restructuring language now says Kennaugh The status quo is not an acceptable option We have to establish a better standard for interdealer business or risk less liquidity and a great deal of added basis risk within dealer books Although achieving consensus will not be easy Kennaughs hope is that some standard acceptable to investors hedgers and dealers alike can be established Then anything different from that standard will continue to be available in the market at a premium or discounted price depending upon the specific language used The milliondollar question So what should ISDA do to set the credit derivatives market back on course There are two basic pathswith numerous permutations buried withinthe trade group could take First it could try to narrow the definition of restructuring and limit the deliverability under a restructuring to the actual loans or bonds in question or to paper with a shorter tenor than the restructuring period The language to accomplish this might require some tricky drafting but the goal would be to give sellers of credit derivatives more solace that they could not be blindsided on a loan restructuring with the delivery of longerdated paper while the buyers of credit default swaps would still maintain the regulatory ability to tender restructured paper This compromise however could create a twostep delivery option On the occasion of a loan restructuring the holder of a credit default swap might be able to either tender the actual loan affected or a similar shortterm piece of debt or hold onto the credit derivative for the possibility of an actual bankruptcy event at a later date If bankruptcy eventually transpired then any paper out to a predefined maturity would be renderable In other words there could be one central contract but with a new delivery twist within it That might be a possible outcome says BofAs Harlan But banks are so conservative I think almost everyone would exercise the credit derivative on the first goround The pressure just to get troubled debt off ones books would dominate the potential reward of gleaning even greater value from the default swap later on Others arent so sure this solution would work It might introduce too much uncertainty into the delivery process People want to know what they are going to get and when says Hilmar Schaumann head of credit derivatives trading for Swiss Re New Markets in New York At the moment credit default swaps can be triggered by either the buyer or seller of the swap in order not to leave the seller hanging with a contingent liability If a narrowed restructuring delivery option is introduced it is likely that only the buyer of the default swap would have the power to decide whether to deliver a specific restructured loan Some also argue that to be completely fair the party long the credit default swap and tendering the loan should be forced to hand over any added fees collected from the restructuring This is not currently standard practice The inclusion of a materiality clause is another possible permutation of the restructuring language being bandied about Such a clause could stipulate that a restructuring only be considered a default event if the credit rating of the underlying corporate entity subsequently deteriorates beyond a stated level Given the large range of potential underlying credits however the specific drafting required here might be even more difficult for participants to agree on in advance The other major alternative would be to continue allowing the two contractsone with restructuring and the other withoutto simply develop of their own accord with Darwinian forces of supply and demand deciding which is more useful and popular as a core product Restructuring would just become another checkbox among many on the ISDA document that people could either use or ignore Such an approach might result in more documentation mismatches and basis risk on dealer books but it might also keep diverse enduser participants more satisfied ISDA cannot unilaterally tell the market what it should use says Jeremy Barnum head credit derivatives trader at JP Morgan People will trade what contracts they want to trade and we may have to wait to see which contract that will be There is a perception that without regulatory capital relief the market just dies but that is patently wrong Banks are increasingly a small percentage of the market If banks still want relief with restructuring included that price exists today and will continue to exist It just may not be the standard contract anymore It is possible of course that the market will end up with a refined restructuring definition and a checkbox approach to whether restructuring is included in a deal or not Barnum for one thinks it is unrealistic to expect a single contract that unifies bank loan people and bond investorstwo groups with fundamentally different needs and desires But ISDA had the foresight to structure its document in a menu framework where you can check off prepackaged definitions he says so were likely just headed to another checkbox solution maybe with some improved definitions within Whatever ISDA decides it must do so quickly before other credit derivative problems pop up A year ago for example Xerox credit default swaps were trading at just basis points per annum Now they are basis points bid with no offer Overall Xerox has billion in out standing debt and is quickly approaching full usage of its bank lines of credit Separately many of its interest rate and equity swap agreements have embedded credit clauses that will force it to liquidate these contracts should it be downgraded below a certain credit rating Its easy to imagine yet another situation where Xerox may technically fall into default on certain obligations but continue to pay interest on other paper It is also noteworthy that Conseco credit default swaps involved only a few hundred million dollars in notional obligations while the outstanding amount of credit derivatives written on Xerox is quite a bit greater Lawsuits havent sprung from the Conseco situation but they could for Xerox since there is more money on the table Were just starting to see the world of distressed securities realize that some of these clauses that many thought didnt matter actually matter a great deal says Leslie Rahl president of Capital Market Risk Advisors Xerox in particular may be a good example of documentation language that was intended to protect counterparties in a downgrade situation but now may have unintended negative consequences if these clauses actually get triggered Rahl acknowledges that credit trigger levels need to be precise but she also worries that they introduce a certain amount of systemic risk Given the proclivity of rating agencies to downgrade whole industry sectors at the same time she says credit triggers are the one thing in my mind that could cause systemic risk and bring on required kneejerk reactions While ISDA is at it some also think that language revolving around successor corporations should be examined ISDA documentation provides that after a merger spinoff or other corporate restructuring a credit derivative will apply to the surviving corporation that inherits the majority of the original debt But what happens to a credit derivative contract if say ATT gets split into four equal parts with equal debt loads Perhaps the credit derivative should really be split into pieces as well particularly given the massive debt load to be transferred Unfortunately ISDA must work in a world in which financial nuances wreak havoc on derivatives contracts originally designed to be relatively simple and fungible Have you every tried to cash in an insurance policy asks Rahl If you havent read the fine print its not always as easy as it should be she says This is what the credit derivatives market is currently grappling with In other words credit derivatives documentation may have worked reasonably well in good times but what happens in bad Thats an important question given the current spate of earnings warnings and massive corporate debt loads If more credit problems flare up soon ISDA documentation will likely come under even more scrutiny with Conseco simply having been the first warning shot across the bow of the credit derivatives market In a litigious society where a

Committee hears Lamfalussy on financial services Reuters Bank regulator intervenes in Turkish crisis Financial Times Slightly Altered Bankruptcy Bill Clears Senate Committee American Banker FASB Excludes Joint Ventures From Business Combinations Project BNA March NORWALK ConnThe Financial Accounting Standards Board Feb wrestled with how to define joint ventures business enterprises intended to be outside the scope of rules on business combinations and the kind of reporting that will leave deeper imprints on firms earnings statements than current practice FASB specifically excluded joint ventures from its pending proposal on accounting for mergers and acquisitions The proposal is expected to yield final rules in late June The rationale for the decision to exclude joint ventures is the idea that there exist shared enterprises or mutually beneficial projects of companies or other entities that do not represent an acquisition of one enterprise by another Instead two or more existing corporations governments or perhaps even individual people may combine assets and create a genuinely new enterprise to for example develop a new product or technology Such joint ventures often carry with them veto rights of the venturers that typically are not enjoyed by shareholders of a public company Goal Is Speedy Issuance In addition FASB members have stressed their goal of issuing as quickly as possible a standard to remedy longstanding problems in the use of the poolingofinterests method of accounting in more breadandbutter corporate combinations In the past joint ventures have presented difficult definitional problems They are a focus of the phase two of the boards business combinations project which deals with new basis accounting issues At the same time FASB believes the topic of joint ventures warrants actionor at least some clarificationto address the misapplication of joint venture accounting to transactions that should be accounted for as business combinations according to a recommendation of the boards staff endorsed at the Feb meeting Under current accounting practice for joint ventures the assets in play are reported on a carryover basis at historical cost That treatment mirrors the effect of a pooling under which the book values of the assets of two combining companies are merely added together leaving no dent on the income statement With the impending issuance of the new rules on combinations FASB would bar poolings and instead require use of the purchase method of accounting Under purchase accounting one company is identified as the acquirer It must record the cost of purchasing a company on its books whether it uses cash or exchanges stock to acquire the target firm APB s Description Clarified In defining joint venture FASB Feb tentatively decided to retain the description of the term in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock It also would add the clarifications to help draw boundaries around use of joint venture accounting in areas where the planned rules on combinations should come into play The term corporate joint venture refers to a corporation owned and operated by a small group of businesses the joint venturers as a separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the members of the group APB the rulemaking board that preceded FASB stated in Opinion No A government may also be a member of the group APB said the purpose of a joint venture frequently is to share risks and rewards in developing a new market product or technology and to pool knowhow and resources to reach the joint goal In addition such a corporate joint venture usually provides an arrangement under which each venturer may help manage the venture and have an interest or relationship other than as a passive investor according to APB No In extended discussion that showed how difficult the issue of joint ventures is FASB agreed most strongly on adding by way of clarification that the participating rights entailed in taking part in a joint venture have some economic substance beyond shareholder rights Along those lines FASB and its staff plan to refer to guidance completed in by the boards Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No That guidance is used for investors accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of voting interest in a firm but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights Sticky Issues Two other issues to be taken up in the planned clarification proved to be sticky Feb First the board will try to resolve whether an individual person can be a joint venturer in other words whether an individuals participation in what is termed a joint venture can mean that the label is legitimate and not simply form part of a cover for what in reality is a business combination or acquisition That issue carries some relevance internationally as pointed out by Michael Crooch a FASB member In some countries laws require that a citizen of that country be a partnerif not a majority shareholder of recordin an enterprise financed by a foreign company The last issue confronting FASB pertains to planned transactions The board posed the following question If a company planned at the date of formation of the venture to issue a public offering of stock stemming from the venture was the enterprise a joint venture What if the offering of stock were unplannned In coming weeks FASBs staff plans to work on answering those questions and return to the board with recommendations We need to take this around the track one more time said FASB Chairman Edmund Jenkins The board plans to make the envisioned language on joint ventures part of the standard on business combinations rather than place it in the planned rules basis for conclusions Derivatives Guidance to Be on Web Separately Feb FASB approved clarifications to cure some confusion about use of guidance on the boards rules on derivatives and hedge accounting Statement No The guidance developed with the help of the boards Derivatives Implementation Group was cleared previously by the board DIG Issue No H Measuring the Amount of Ineffectiveness in a Net Investment Hedge FASB plans to post the revised guidance March on its World Wide Web site EP Committee hears Lamfalussy on financial services Reuters English News Service March Lamfalussy and financial services MEPs seek call back mechanism Appearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee Alexandre LAMFALUSSY chair of the Group of Wise Men on Financial Services responded to concerns raised by MEPs seeking a call back mechanism as part of a new approach to speed up the integration of Europes financial markets The committee wants to retain the right to review legislation as it passes through various processes should this be considered necessary Mr LAMFALUSSY has proposed setting up two new committees an EU Securities Committee and an EU Securities Regulatory Committee to help speed up necessary financial reforms He has offered to allay Parliaments concerns by keeping MEPs informed of the work of both committees by the provision of documents minutes and agendas and the introduction of a procedure whereby if Parliament passed a resolution taking the view that the Commission exceeded its legislative powers then the Commission should take the utmost account of the European Parliaments position a procedure which he admitted did not amount to a formal call back position but would in practice amount to the same thing At the same time he could not envisage the Commission ignoring Parliaments view In the ensuing discussions attention focussed on whether or not this amounted to sufficient controls on the Commission and the proposed European Securities Committee One fear is that this new body which Mr LAMFALUSSY recommends should be chaired by the Commission but composed of high level national civil servants of state secretary level would be the key decisionmaking body responsible for the technical details and under the control of national governments The report will be discussed at the March plenary and the committee will meet again next week with a view to proposing a draft resolution to plenary Bank regulator intervenes in Turkish crisis Financial Times March By Leyla Boulton Uncertainty over the Turkish governments next steps in the economic crisis gripping the country continued yesterday as the Ankara Chamber of Industry said foreign companies were refusing to accept letters of credit issued by Turkish companies Local banks were also reported to be freezing personal and company loans and the use of credit cards In its first move since the crisis erupted last week the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency took control of a small troubled bank Ulusal Bank while Bulent Ecevit prime minister expressed the hope Ankara could secure a Dollars bn loan from foreign banks to help it through the crisis Separately the government expressed hope that Kemal Dervis a top Turkish economist at the World Bank in Washington would accept the job of central bank governor The post has been vacant since Gazi Ercel the former governor resigned last weekend after the government was forced to allow the free float of the Turkish lira Turkish officials are now negotiating with the IMF and World Bank a revised disinflation plan together with a bank restructuring strategy But they are not expected to make any announcements before the start on Monday of the weeklong religious holiday of Eid alAdha and before the central bank governor and treasury chief are replaced Despite Mr Ecevits optimism over future loans analysts and bankers said it was more important for the government to show it was serious about economic reform in general and bank restructuring in particular Apart from implementing radical fiscal measures and privatisation this meant closing any other unhealthy institutions among privately owned Turkish commercial banks to counter the twin shock of a big jump in interest rates followed by a devaluation If the bad banks are not closed down they will ruin the market for the healthy ones said one senior banker who declined to be identified Aluk Akdogan analyst at Salomon Smith Barney concurred saying the countrys four biggest private banks still seen as sound accounted for per cent of the industrys Dollars bn equity But their net foreign exchange liabilities which he estimated as not exceeding per cent of their equity base could become more difficult to trim if weak banks were allowed to continue to drain available liquidity The government also faces the challenge of dealing with four stateowned banks that account for per cent of deposits and have accumulated historic losses of at least Dollars bn But analysts say dealing more effectively with the stateowned banks also risks uncovering corruption which could in turn hurt individual members of the threeparty coalition government This is above all a crisis of political leadership said Charles Blitzer an economist who follows Turkey closely Slightly Altered Bankruptcy Bill Clears Senate Committee American Banker March By Nicole Duran WASHINGTON The Senate Judiciary Committee cleared the bankruptcy overhaul bill Wednesday eliminating one sticking point but leaving several others for Thursdays anticipated floor action The legislation appears headed for passage in both chambers Theyre not going to stop it Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch said of the bills opponents after the committees lOto vote in favor of the bill The Utah Republican said that opponents could slow the legislation down but predicted they will ultimately fail unless the entire process breaks down and there is no bipartisanship The House cleared the way for a vote on its version of the bankruptcy bill Wednesday afternoon and was expected to begin debate this morning The Senate Judiciary Committee accepted some Democratic amendments Wednesday most notably one by Sen Charles Schumer DNY that would prohibit people convicted of crimes from filing for bankruptcy to avoid paying courtordered fines penalties or damages Similar amendments that specifically applied to people convicted of violence against abortion clinics held up identical bankrupt cy legislation in the th Congress before it eventually passed only to be pocketvetoed by thenPresident Clinton Sen Schumer modified his amendment to eliminate all specific references to abortion He scored again when the committee unanimously agreed to adopt his netting amendment The provision is designed to limit the damage that can occur when a company that holds derivatives contracts files for bankruptcy Under current law derivative contracts are frozen in a bankruptcy proceeding which prevents creditors of a bankrupt institution from settling their obligations The amendment would allow creditors to reconcile or net out their derivatives contracts and thus reduce their losses Sen Hatch and Sen Patrick Leahy of Vermont the ranking Democrat on the committee collaborated on an amendment to protect consumer privacy Their amendment adopted on a voice vote would prohibit companies filing for bankruptcy from selling client lists containing personal information such as Social Security numbers as a way to pay off creditors The provision also would create a consumer privacy ombudsman to protect consumers interests in bankruptcy court Sen Leahy said the ToySmartcom case revealed the need for such a provision The company had a privacy statement assuring customers that personal information would be kept confidential but when it went under the bankruptcy judge ordered it to sell one of its only assets its customer list to pay off its debts Sen Leahy said Sen Russ Feingold DWis a vocal bankruptcy opponent got about half his amendments approved outright and agreed to save some of his more controversial provisions for the Senate floor Two of his victories concern farming One of his amendments would make it easier for farmers to qualify for more lenient Chapter terms by lowering the amount of a filers income that comes from farming operations to from and by doubling the debt limit to million The other would ensure that any bankruptcy payment plan leaves a farmer with enough money to continue farming The panel also agreed to a modified version of Sen Feingolds amendment dealing with renters eviction during bankruptcy proceedings The committees work Tuesday and Wednesday still left about half of Democrats odd amendments to be tackled on the Senate floor Some of the more nettlesome outstanding points concern whether bankruptcy filers can keep expensive homes and how much information credit companies must provide consumers about interest rates and minimum payments End of ISDA Press Report for March THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF ISDAS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

restructuring info session ECB intervention fails to bolster euro Corporates Caught Napping As Deadline For FAS looms Derivatives traders at JP Morgan are delighted Derivatives Week November Tax Change to Boost Danish Derivatives Market A change in Danish tax law that is expected to be passed this month should lead to a surge in derivatives use among pension funds and life insurance companies Jens Kristensen head of the financial division at the Danish Ministry of Economic Affairs in Copenhagen said the tax rates for all the gains on investments for pension funds and life insurance companies are being equalized at Previously there were tax incentives to investing in cash equitiesgains on equity positions were taxed at The flip side of this was that nonequity investments including hedging were taxed at a much higher rate and losses on cash investments were not offsettable against gains on hedges Clause Stampe chief investment officer at pension fund Laegernes Pensionskasse in Copenhagen said it plans to increase its use of derivatives because of the taxation change It will use more derivatives to hedge all of its noneuro and nonkrone denominated fixed income portfolio and its equity portfolio where it feels there is currency risk About of the funds DKK billion USD billion portfolio is in noneuro or kronedenominated fixed income products The pension fund already occasionally uses foreign exchange swaps and options to hedge equity investments but not fixed income products Stampe said he envisages its use of derivatives to hedge equity would increase slightly but said it was too early to estimate by how much Pensionskassen for jusristernes og okonomernes a pension fund is going to start using derivatives according to Jesper Jakobsen strategist and head of asset allocation in Copenhagen He said it was too early to tell exactly what strategies it will pursue but he envisages the fund will use derivatives for hedging all asset classes because of the change in tax law Previously there was a lower tax for equity to encourage Danish pension funds and life insurance companies to invest in local equities With global capital increasingly dominating the local equity market local institutional investors are no long required to maintain liquidity on the Danish stock market Derivatives Week November ISDA plans restructuring info session The International Swaps ant Derivatives Association is holding a meeting in the next two weeks to discuss restructuring as a credit event Credit derivatives players recently were at loggerheads regarding whether restructuring should be listed as a credit event under the standard terms of singlename credit default swaps DW A group of dealers in New York elected last month to stop including restructuring as a credit event when quoting prices for standard singlename credit default swaps Restructuring as a credit event will still be available as a menu choice on the ISDA confirm ant will not be removed from the ISDA definitions According to Bob Pickel general counsel at ISDA in New York dealers and end users have had numerous questions regarding the decision and ISDAs credit derivatives documentation task force is providing a forum for those questions to be answered Some dealers reported a slowdown in the credit default swap market following the decision Others said that they saw no slowdown in their trading activity and noted that even if there was a slowdown it cannot be linked to the decision Cash markets remain volatile and there has been little in the way of new bond issuance or loan activity recently they added Pickel emphasized that the main point of the meetings is to allow participants to provide information rather than provide a forum for debate Because this is a market practice issue it is not up to ISDA to rule how parties should trade Meetings will be held concurrently in New York and London with a brief conference call joining both of the meetings The meeting is open to all ISDA members Separately ISDA is planning to complete its strategic documentation review by yearend Financial Times November ECB intervention fails to bolster euro By Christopher Swan and Adrienne Roberts The European Central Bank intervened in foreign exchange markets yesterday for the second consecutive trading day emphasising its determination to defend the currency The unilateral move by the bank initially drove the single currency almost a cent higher to But the impact was shortlived The release of figures indicating that growth is slowing both in the eurozone and in its biggest economy Germany pushed the euro back below the level at which it had started the day It finished in London at down from its close on Friday In Birmingham Romano Prodi president of the European Commission expressed full confidence in Wim Duisenberg chairman of the European Central Bank and insisted that the euro would recover more ground Sales of distressed assets by Japanese banks and other financial institutions to investors such as US hedge funds have unexpectedly slowed in recent months bankers and analysts say The decline is likely to raise new unease about the health of Japans financial industry and its slow progress in cleaning up the problems caused by the collapse of the countrys s bubble Some industry observers suspect that one reason for the slowdown is that falling Japanese share prices have eroded the banks capital and left them unwilling to make additional provisions for losses If the slowdown persists this could leave some foreign funds and banks reexamining their attempts to build a distresseddebt business in Japan Precise data on the distresseddebt market is not available because it is one of the most secretive sectors of Japans financial markets Derivatives Week November Corporates Caught Napping As Deadline For FAS looms A raft of corporates have delayed implementing the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement and are scrambling to meet the deadline which for most companies is Jan The big five have been warning people for years not to delay in figuring out how to implement FAS but a lot of people didnt listen said Rob Royall partner in the national accounting group at Ernst Young in New York Dilip Kumar partner at Arthur Andersen in New York added that billiondollar companies have been laggards in implementing the measure although he declined to name them We were worried that would happen said Bob Wilkins senior project manager in charge of FAS at the accounting standards board in Norwalk Conn He noted that the standard was originally slated to come into effect for fiscal years beginning after June Corporations concerned about digesting the bulky standard while also preparing for YK persuaded the FASB to push the deadline back to fiscal years beginning after June For most companies thats Jan Cynics here said that some companies would just let the standard sit on their bookshelves for another year he added The standard itself is daunting consisting of about pages plus pages of derivatives implementation group interpretations Ernst Youngs Royall said the whole document could balloon to pages by a year from now as hazy parts of the standard are cleared up Satish Rishi vp and assistant treasurer at Dell Computer in Austin Texas noted that his company has preparing for some time for the new standard and will be ready for it when the deadline arrives But he noted that companies that have not planned adequately are reaching a crunch point now ZD U AND

offers Gore and Bush derivatives Reuters November Sri Lanka Plans To Deregulate Broking Industry Sri Lanka plans to deregulate its broking industry and to allow for specialised brokers who will promote new risk instruments the director general of the Colombo Stock Exchange CSE said We are looking at the deregulation of the stock broking industry to allow free entry and exit Hiran Mendis told a forum of business leaders late on Thursday In the current system the CSE board advertises slots for broking licences and approves eligible applications We will allow brokers to do more investment banking margin lending and dealing on their own account and are also considering brokers doing their own underwriting Mendis said Brokers fees are too high due to the lack of diversification in activities Mendis said The CSE has been badly hit by an exodus of foreign equity capital this year due to an escalation in Sri Lankas ethnic war Average daily trading volumes were down to about million rupees last month half the volume from earlier this year The key Colombo all share index opened around on Friday up from the low of the year of in May but down from the years high of The CSE also plans to introduce derivatives shortselling and securities lending from around September At present Sri Lankas broking firms act only as agency brokers while having some leeway to extend margin lending facilities and to trade on their own account Mendis said brokers would also be allowed to segment their activities with some offering trading facilities and others clearing and settlement services We also hope to introduce Internet trading in the next threefour months Mendis added rupees Financial Times November Battle For The Benchmark Is On The French government bond market has benefited from the launch of the euro but possibly not as much as it might have liked to according to market strategists When the introduction of the European single currency did away with currency risk among the participating countries France set out to topple Germany from its position as the benchmark provider for the European government bond market Germany has maintained that position mainly as a result of the strength of its currency the DMark as well as the reputation of its central bank the Bundesbank But with the first no longer an independent entity and the second stripped of its monetary policy remit the battle for providing the new eurozone benchmark has been thrown open So far the outcome is inconclusive Market participants praise the French government debt agency France Tresor for its transparent information policy and efficient debt management at a time when falling budget deficits and windfall earnings from the sale of mobile phone licenses are reducing European governments need to borrow It is certainly the case that the information policy of France Tresor is better than that of the various bodies in Germany says Daniel Pfandler bond strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson But Germany remains the benchmark in and year issues whereas in the twoand fiveyear maturities one could argue that France is ahead Frances deficit is expected to fall to per cent of gross domestic product next year excluding the projected receipts from UMTS mobile licences Including those receipts France expects a small surplus However there should be little impact on bond issuance as UMTS receipts expected to amount to some Euros bn are spread over several years France has also embarked on an active debt management programme in order to boost liquidity even as financing requirements fall That includes the activities of agencies such as the Caisse dAmortissement de la Dette Sociale which refinances the debt of Frances social security system and will continue to be active in the market But although France has emerged as the leading European issuer in some maturities and some types of bonds many investors especially outside the eurozone continue to regard Germany as the point of reference for eurodenominated government bonds Germanys competitive advantage in the year maturities is underpinned by the liquidity in the Bund futures market on Eurex the SwissGerman derivatives exchange which is perceived as the European market leader But the French policy of releasing issuance schedules up to a year in advance with bond auctions held regularly every month is seen as superior to Germanys quarterly schedules France has also traditionally provided a more regular supply of liquid issues over the whole range of maturities from to year bonds France has always had liquid issuances spread much more evenly across the whole of the yield curve says Nathalie Fillet bond strategist at BNP Paribas The fiveyear BTAN is now widely regarded as the benchmark trading at the same or a slightly lower yield than its German counterpart the Bobl France has also led the way in launching the first eurodenominated index linked bond known as OATi and runs the most developed market for strippable government bonds which can be split into their component parts of coupons and principal Even so French bonds in parts of the yield curve still trade at a spread over the German governments Bunds meaning that France is borrowing at a more expensive interest rate than Germany The French curve offers more steady large issuances it is very transparent and from the French Tresors point of view that should certainly be producing narrower spreads says Padhraic Garvey senior bond strategist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam But the French curve is regarded as a spread product because the German market is seen as the anchor to the system for historic reasons Mr Garvey said that this year spreads between German bunds and other European government bonds have widened as a result of increasing worries in the market over the quality of European monetary union Those fears were exacerbated by the relentless slide of the euro on the foreign exchange markets Greeces decision to join the euro next year while Denmark has decided to stay out has further shaken investor confidence The launch of euro notes and coins in is likely to help allay fears that monetary union could break up and that is likely to produce tighter spreads between European government bonds The Hindustan Times November Swiss bank offers Gore and Bush derivatives A SWISS bank is offering

Services Reform Body Urged Lamfalussy group sees the way to a golden future for an integrated market Few issuers expected for first SET index options Acceptance hinges on Derivatives Act Bangkok Post SET options will be the first derivative index launched on the Stock Exchange of Thailand next year as a new riskmanagement tool for investors But a lack of firms willing to issue index options remains a challenge Regulators will allow the issue of both call and put options based on index changes A buyer of a call option for instance will receive payment for the difference in the change of the index if it rises above a set level Similarly a buyer of a put option is paid if the index falls Suvit Mapaisansin managing director of Merrill Lynch Phatra Securities said index options would become an important riskmanagement tool In overseas markets most regulators choose to develop a futures market first to support derivative instruments While Thailand plans to eventually develop a futures market final passage of a new Derivatives Act is needed first Mr Suvit said both futures and options were needed to enable investors to fully manage their risk The SET has sort of moved backward developing options before futures Under such circumstances the market will have only buyers with few sellers The sentiment for market trends will be similar both for puts and calls Brokers would likely serve as intermediaries in processing orders rather than taking positions themselves to limit their own risks Mr Suvit said I think there is interest among investors in the instruments but the problem is that there are no issuers yet Full development of options would likely await the launch of the futures market How successful derivative instruments become will hinge on overall investment sentiment SET officials acknowledge that the lack of issuers poses problems The draft Derivatives Act is being reviewed by the Council of State and then will be scrutinised by various agencies before final submission to Parliament Investment Instrument Standards Fight Grows Australian Financial Review By Roger Hogan The controversy over how Australian companies should account for financial instruments is likely to intensify during the next few weeks when a joint working group set up by the Australian Accounting Standards Board releases a draft document designed to settle the question According to the AASBs chairman Mr Keith Alfredson the document on which comments will be invited is likely to blow the minds of many in the financial markets major corporates and the accounting profession judging by the criticisms it has attracted even before its publication But he said time for argument was fast running out Whatever happened after the draft and invitation to comment were issued in the runup to Christmas Australia will have to make a choice Accounting bodies worldwide have been working on standards for financial instruments to prevent the derivatives related disasters that rocked many companies during the late s and early s including US company Procter Gamble which lost US million on interestrate derivatives in The matter has become urgent in Australia partly because the United States has introduced its own standard Financial Accounting Standard Board statement No which became effective for some companies on July and which will operate from January for those whose financial years coincide with the calendar FAS is regarded as a nightmare by corporate treasurers in the US and here because it requires derivatives and other financial instruments to be marked to market every quarter rather than accounted for on a fairvalue basis Its critics claim it will lead to volatility and confusion in company financial statements Mr Alfredson said that in the US there is now a special interpretation group like the Urgent Issues Group here interpreting In other words it is so complex readers cant just read the standard and interpret it The group has already issued more than interpretations Australia has no accounting standard that deals comprehensively with the recognition and measurement of financial instruments although it has made progress with disclosure requirements Acknowledging the concern over the marktomarket approach the AASB commissioned the development of a fairvalue model The joint working group consists of representatives from Australia Canada France Germany New Zealand the Nordic countries Britain the US and the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC has incorporated elements of FAS into its own muchcriticised financial instruments standard IAS It remains to be seen how much simpler the fairvalue approach will be In fairvalue accounting you get the market value for the instruments at the time and fair value them It sounds easy in principle but it is much more complicated in practice Mr Alfredson said Developing the appropriate standard is only half the battle however the trick is to gain widespread acceptance for it Even if Australia accepted the fairvalue model Mr Alfredson said it would not be able to implement it alone at least if I have any influence There would need to be a convergence by the major standardsetters after appropriate due processes including field testing of its relevance and reliability to preparers and users Either that or we may have to go to something else Perhaps FAS and all its committees Derivatives Standards Need Check Australian Financial Review By Roger Hogan The Bank for International Settlements will indirectly highlight the need for appropriate accounting standards for derivatives today when it releases statistics showing global overthecounter derivatives markets continue to grow strongly with total notional outstandings for the first half of the year at US trillion trillion This represents a per cent increase on the US billion at December and reflects an overall buoyancy of the market which contrasts sharply with the stagnation of volumes on derivatives exchanges The notional value of exchangetraded contracts during the first half was US trillion the same as December Another trend picked out by the BIS data is the rise of the euro as a key currency in the derivatives market It extended its already dominant position in the interest rate derivatives markets where it accounted for the equivalent of US trillion or per cent of the total compared with US trillion per cent in the previous period Growth during the first half was led by forwardtype contracts particularly interest rate swaps outright forwards and foreign exchange swaps said the BIS The biggest segment interest rate derivatives grew by per cent to US trillion Most of the growth was in swaps which expanded percent to US trillion Swaps have grown more quickly than other interest rate derivatives for the past few years a trend the BIS said might be explained by the development of various swap structures which might have enabled the market to respond to endusers needs in a more flexible way than exchangetraded interest derivatives Other reasons included the introduction of the euro and its stimulus to the growth of European capital markets issuance some exposure to which was likely to have been hedged in the interest rate swap market and reduced government bond issuance which would have made government bond futures less useful as hedging instruments Not surprisingly given the currency volatility during the first half the value of contracts outstanding in various currency instruments increased per cent to US trillion This included a very sharp per cent rise in contracts involving the euro the value of US and sterling contracts rose and per cent respectively Activity in the equitylinked sector fell by per cent to US trillion while that in commodity derivatives markets increased by per cent to US billion Looking behind these face values the actual credit exposures of financial institutions to derivatives fell by per cent from US trillion to US billion Osaka and Dow To Form Derivatives Alliance Financial Times October By Bayan Rahman Osaka Securities Exchange Japans secondlargest stock exchange and Dow Jones Co the US index provider will on Thursday sign an agreement to list the US companys derivatives products on the OSE early next year Osaka will develop futures and options contracts whose value will be linked to the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Goro Tatsumi OSE president and David Moran president of Dow Jones Indexes will sign a memorandum of understanding in Osaka on Thursday The OSE is seeking derivativesrelated tieups to expand its range of global products to attract international clients The move is also designed to help the exchange defend its market share against the threat from hour and internet trading The agreement between the Osaka exchange and Dow Jones follows another one between the OSE and Nasdaq of the US to list derivatives products based on the Nasdaq index The OSE is also in talks with the Chicago Board Options Exchange and is considering talks with Eurex the SwissGerman derivatives exchange Australia Credit Derivatives Turnover At AB Dow Jones International News By Adam Bradbery SYDNEY Dow Jones The Australian credit derivatives market saw total turnover for the financial year of A billion up substantially from the Australian Financial Markets Association said Monday This is the first year the AFMA has surveyed the credit derivatives market but it estimates turnover was A billion to A billion in Credit derivatives are instruments that allow market participants to manage the credit risk within their assets or to take exposure to such risk to boost returns This shows that the market has liquidity and depth said AFMA credit derivatives committee chairman Pierre Katerdjian The findings are the result of a survey conducted by AFMA and the Securities Industry Research Centre of AsiaPacific Its very encouraging particularly as there are still a number of offshore banks and investment houses which trade Australian name default swaps but which were not captured by the AFMA survey Katerdjian said AFMA Chief Executive Ken Farrow says that the growth in the market is good for Australias lenders and helpful in lowering systemic risk in Australian financial markets Katerdjian says most market participants expect turnover of credit derivatives to increase this financial year from last year with the global reduction in government debt on issue and the increased liquidity of corporate bond markets encouraging this trend There is a greater need to hedge credit risk and these instruments are the most efficient way to do that he said Powerful Financial Services Reform Body Urged Financial Times November By Peter Norman The European Union needs a powerful new EU securities committee to help speed regulatory reform In markets for financial services and capital a special EU group on securities regulation proposed yesterday The group rejected the idea of a single EU regulatory agency at his stage of the development of the EUs securities markets This idea which would require changes to EU treaties gained little support from market practitioners But Alexandre Lamfalussy the former Belgian central banker who chaired the so called wise mens group urged EU leaders at next Marchs summit in Stockholm to agree to proposals for a new faster method of regulatory reform and make commitments for it to be in place in the EU by We can no longer afford the luxury of regulatory inefficiency in the instantaneous internet age declared Mr Lamfalussy Financial markets are changing by the week and European regulation is simply not up to speed The report said an efficient regulatory process for financial services and capital markets was crucial for the EU and its citizens because it would boost growth competitiveness and jobs Mr Lamfalussy said the proposed system which would have the securities committee work out the detailed implementation of new regulations could cut the time needed to complete reforms substantially and possibly by a half The committee which would consist of representatives of the Commission and member states would be able to adapt existing legislation to changed circumstances very quickly he added Mr Lamfalussy made clear that the fast track system being proposed would have to be monitored carefully and reviewed promptly if found to be manifestly failing to secure progress The interim report was welcomed by representatives of the financial sector Some bankers said it was auspicious that the final recommendations would be delivered in February during EU presidency of Sweden which is known to favour speeding the development of the single financial market Adam Ridley direcxtor general of the London Investment Banking Association said the report proposed a sensible institutional structure He welcomed the decision to initiate a wide debate on the proposals before production of the groups final report Paul Ariman the secretary general of the Federation of European Stock Exchanges praised the reports very pragmatic approach noting that it would have taken at least three years to set up a single European regulator Mr Lamfalussy said regulatory changes were especially urgent if the EU was to create a real single market for financial services He endorsed the proposals of the EUs financial services action plan but urged that it be completed by The present target of could be missed unless the EU adopted the groups fast track approach on legislation he warned Lamfalussy group sees the way to a golden future for an integrated market Financial Times By Peter Norman The average US investment fund is six times larger than its European equivalent Venture capital per head of population in the European Union is onefifth of US levels The average annual real return on US pension funds was per cent between and against percent in the EU With these facts Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy and his group of wise men highlighted the deficiencies of the EUs financial market in yesterdays interim report on the regulation of European securities markets The prize of creating a properly integrated European financial services and capital market that would virtually complete the EUs single market for goods and services was couched in correspondingly glittering terms Financial market integration Mr Lamfalussy said would lead to increased productivity of both capital and labour enabling the Europes economy to grow faster and create more jobs It would bring benefits to consumers through higher returns to small and mediumsized enterprises through more venture capital and to large companies through lower capital costs The reforms needed to create such a market have long been identified and cover issues such as new rules for regulated and non regulated markets a single passport to ease the raising of capital across borders and updating investment rules for pension and investment funds They form the EUs financial services action plan due to be implemented by but which the Lamfalussy group wants completed by The problem so far has been putting in place the regulatory conditions to police such a market in a period of rapid technological and market change As Mr Lamfalussys report recalled it takes an average three years to agree an EU regulation or directive and delays can be much longer The EU takeover directive has been under discussion for years and still to be enacted The report called for a regulatory system that can adjust continuously flexibly and rapidly to future developments which are unpredictable today It must not inhibit legitimate market development and be neu tral as regards competition between different service providers The current system Mr Lamfalussy complained is too slow too rigid and contains too much ambiguity and inconsistent implementation The novelty of yesterdays report is in the way it draws on a little used element of the EUs legislative procedure to propose a faster way of introducing and implementing legislation governing financial markets At first sight its four level approach for securities legislation appears technical and undramatic But by using the process known as comitology it offers a chance of halving the time needed to introduce financial market rules Mr Lamfalussys group proposed that future EU securities legislation should concentrate on principles rather than details The legislation which would be agreed in the usual way by the council of ministers and the European parliament on a proposal of the Commission would ideally be framed as EU regulations which do not require transposing into national law A new EU securities committee would define how these principles would be implemented It would comprise Commission officials and representatives of member states who would decide technical details and update them when necessary EU member states would be responsible for implementing the legislation ensuring that it was consistent and equivalent throughout the KU This would entail much greater cooperation between regulators and the Commission The attraction of the plan is that it could be enacted without changing the EU treaties and in force by the beginning of It would be closely monitored and reviewed around However Mr Lamfalussy made clear the new procedure would need political endorsement at the highest level and suggested EU leaders at their Stockholm summit in March next year should pass a resolution agreeing a series of commitments to be delivered by His fast track method would also have to win the support of the European parliament which has adopted a generally hostile approach to comitology because it pares its powers Stressing that yesterdays report was an interim proposal Mr Lamfalussy said his group would now seek political and market reactions End of ISDA Press Report for Thursday November THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE

Commodities Laws In Legislative Limbo AG Subcommittee Candidate Raises Eyebrows SFE Cleared To Sell In US Markets Digest Levitts Options Penny Postulation Too Pricey Reform Of Investment Rules Urged Financial Times November The European Commission is pressing for a radical overhaul of its investment rules to keep up with the accelerating pace of change in securities markets and to encourage more crossborder trade Frits Bolkestein the EUs single market commissioner will launch a widespread consultation process on Thursday to discuss the changes needed to the EUs investment services rules The update of the EUs investment services legislation is one of the top priorities set by the Commission for its financial services work in the next six months EU heads of government want to complete the integration of the financial market by as part of the drive to improve competitiveness Financial services accounts for per cent of EU gross domestic product and this is expected to grow rapidly as the euro and new technology lead to a more integrated capital market Part of the drive to overhaul the investment legislation is the Commissions recognition that its single passport rules allowing a firm to sell investment services across the EU as long as it complies with supervisory rules in its home country do not work well in practice This is because too many countries impose their own additional specifically local restrictions in the name of investor protection The Commission now wants to ensure that home country rule is enforced for all professional investors such as pension funds and other institutions and any local restrictions removed National supervisors may still impose some restrictions on services provided to retail investors but these should be kept to a minimum This involves countries agreeing on a common definition for a professional investor generally an institution But sophisticated individual investors can also apply to be treated as professionals if they have enough experience and a large portfolio Mr Bolkestein also wants to stimulate discussion among countries about how to achieve more common regulation of markets and trading systems including new electronic trading arrangements It is vital for the Commission to address the discrepancies in regulation between different markets There is a danger that EU rules will not keep up with the growing number of mergers between securities exchanges and the development of electronic marketplaces that are used across borders The consultation exercise will take place until March next year after which the Commission will legislate US Election Has New Commodities Laws In Legislative Limbo Dow Jones News Service November By Dawn Kopecki Like everything else in Washington these days the push for new US commodities laws is stuck in legislative limbo with an unresolved presidential election and an undetermined end to the congressional session Lawmakers were expected to finish outstanding budget work and a handful of policy bills by the end of this week But they decided Monday to suspend all legislative action for the next three weeks returning to work in early December At some point or another we have to do our job But its very hard to do when the election isnt settled said Sen Phil Gramm RTexas The Senate Banking Chairman who objects to the commodities legislation being considered in the Senate didnt rule out anything regarding new derivatives laws or bankruptcy rules Tuesday He spoke with reporters after the Senate GOPs weekly policy lunch Theres still a lot here to be done Gramm said responding to a question about the commodities bill and possible bankruptcy laws There are a lot of things that could happen Senate Agriculture Chairman Richard Lugar RInd hasnt yet decided whether he will push legislation that merely extends current commodities laws or press Senate leaders to pass the House bill that overhauls the laws that oversee the trillion derivatives industry There are so many things up in the air said Senate Agriculture spokeswoman Tiffany Steele Lugar has said in the past that he could bring up the commodities bill that passed the House over Gramms objections and attach it to a federal spending bill before Congress adjourns for the year Thats one of the options being considered Steele said The House bill excludes OTC contracts from US commodities laws eases regulations for US futures exchanges and lifts the year ban on singlestock futures The most recent statistics available placed the total estimated worldwide notional value of outstanding overthecounter derivatives contracts at trillion at the end of June according to the Bank for International Settlements Ag Subcommittee Candidate Raises Eyebrows Wall Street Letter November By Dan Freed One of the more interesting possibilities in the forthcoming appointment of new committee leadership positions in the House of Representatives in the wake of last weeks elections which has thus far escaped the notice of many in Washington involves a subcommittee chairmanship and a crucial piece of legislation A number of committee leadership positions that are critical to the interests of Wall Street are still considered to be open Nick Smith RMichigan was one of only four members of the House of Representatives who voted against the Commodity Futures Modernization Act last month Nevertheless Smith is in the running to be appointed chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee for Risk Management Research and Specialty Crops which wrote the legislation If the bill which would overhaul commodity trading regulations doesnt pass Congress this year Smith could well find himself responsible for writing the next one A spokesman for Smith did not provide an explanation for the congressmans vote by press time and he had no comment on whether Smith would pursue the subcommittee chairmanship One lobbyist could not explain Smiths vote but suggested that the congressman didnt have a solid understanding of the issues surrounding the legislation Hes very strange He attends most of the hearings but he zeroes in on things that dont matter to many people delivery points with Chicago Board of Trade grain contracts People in the audience snicker when he asks questions The lobbyist conceded however that Smith is always open to listening to everyones concerns The Smith spokesman did not return a call requesting a response to these comments Another lobbyist was less critical pointing out that CBOT delivery points are an important issue for Smiths constituents as well as others in his region The first lobbyist doubted that Smith would get the chairmanship and seconded a House staff members guess that the post would go to Frank Lucas itOklahoma who represents both energy and agricultural interests giving him ties to the futures and overthecounter communities Other possibilities are John Boehner itOhio and Terry Everett RAlabama Full Committee chairmanships said to be still undetermined in the House include the two principal financial industry oversight committees Banking and Commerce Marge Roukema RNew Jersey has seniority in the Banking Committee but Richard Baker RLouisiana is considered a contender Michael Oxley ROhio has also been rumored as a possible Banking chairman though he announced his candidacy for the Commerce position last week WJ Billy Tauzin RLouisiana has also staked a claim to Commerce and his battle with Oxley which has flared up in public on occasion will be interesting to watch Chairmanship of the House Ways and Means committee which is responsible for tax issues is also in question Either Philip Crane RIllinois or William Thomas RCalifornia could get the nod SFE Cleared To Sell In US Markets Digest Financial Times November SFE cleared to sell in US The Sydney Futures Exchange said yesterday it was now permitted to directly offer its stock futures and options contracts to US customers The exchange said it had obtained authorisation from US regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and its Share Price Index products were now available to customers globally Introduced in May the SPI futures and options are based on the SPASX index the new benchmark equity index for Australian markets SFEs interest rate and commodity products are already available for trading to customers worldwide Meanwhile the Australian Derivatives Exchange ADX said yesterday it was confident it would be able to open for business within weeks and a firm launch date would be announced as soon as possible The ADX said it believed it was in the final stages of satisfying the information and documentation requirements of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission which was in the process of assessing the exchanges market application Originally scheduled to be launched on October the ADX had postponed its launch date to the middle of November saying more time was required to complete the regulatory process ADX is intended to be a fully electronic derivatives exchange with a global focus Levitts Options Penny Postulation Too Pricey Wall Street Letter November Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitts recent suggestion that the Commission may ban trading and quoting of options contracts in increments larger than a penny has drawn considerable skepticism from a market data expert who said that trading options in pennies would cause a tremendous strain on industry information systems Leo McBlain who chairs the Financial Information Forum an industry organization devoted to information systems matters said that were the Commission to mandate that options trade in pennies it could conceivably cause some firms to choose to abandon the product altogether if they determined that the cost of bringing systems up to speed outweighed the revenue it generated During a speech delivered just over a week ago at the Fordham Law School in New York City Levitt suggested that the Commission might mandate penny increments for options just as it has for stocks McBlain explained that one equity stock can generate as many as options contracts due to different information about prices and expiration dates He noted that options data already accounts for roughly of all market data generated in North America Increasing the number of options pricing possibilities by five or times could generate far more message traffic than current systems can handle Updating those systems could be tremendously costly he said though he wasnt aware that any cost estimates have been made thus far John Panchery who heads the Securities Industry Associations decimals conversion project said that industry attention is still focused on ensuring that it will be able to handle the additional message traffic that will be generated when Nasdaq converts to decimals in the spring He said it was too early to say whether trading options in pennies within a year was an unrealistic goal or whether such a mandate from the SEC might cause some firms to choose not to trade options An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment noting only that Levitt said in his speech that he did not underestimate the technological and regulatory challenges options markets face End of ISDA Press Report for Wednesday November THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED

Derivatives Trade Darts Up In November A Treasury Management ASP for FASB and Beyond The Slow Death Of The FX Salesman New Derivative Squeezes Power Out Of Bottlenecks Dow Jones International News November By Michael Young As the deregulated Nordic power market plugs into new regions an electrical shortcircuit has set off trading in a new derivative Price differences that arise from bottlenecks in the Nordic regions power grid capacity has led the local electricity bourse Nordpool to launch a new category of derivative Contracts for Difference with hedgers and speculators keen to give it a go I think they could easily make some headway into the market and we intend to trade them thats for certain said Allan Toft Hansen power trader at Elsam one of the largest Danish power producers A large proportion of electricity in the Nordic area is traded on the Nordpool exchange the worlds first international commodity exchange for electrical power The bourse matches power producers and power wholesalers setting Nordicwide prices for each hour of the following hour day Also power derivatives such as futures and options are traded and with the contracts for difference a new third type of financial instrument is to be bought and sold Demand for this new type of derivative contract came from price anomalies between the Nordic electricity regions price differences that are the result of bottlenecks in the power grids capacity Nordpool started the new contracts on Nov and in the first week a total of gigawatts hours were traded This was bigger turnover than we expected said Hartvig Munthe Kaas head of corporate communications at Nordpool He added that he was optimistic about turnover developing in coming months although he declined to put a figure on it It is a tool for alleviating a situation where you have different area prices for the same product Kaas added Capacity limits on the power lines may cause for example a predominantly coalpowered western Denmark region to be priced higher than a region in Norway where full reservoirs for hydroelectric plants allow supercheap electricity to stream out of the turbines As a result producers and distributors face uncertainty as to whether their region will be served with the lowest price The contracts for difference allow market players to hedge against or take on the risk of these regional price differences Paradoxically the need for a market in contracts for difference increased with the success of the Nordpool pricing system which was originally designed to ensure more homogeneous pricing for different regions As electricity markets integrate through advanced market systems the grid capacity is overloaded between coalpowered producers with one set of prices and hydropowered producers with another The contracts will become more and more usual the more that hydrogenerated power integrates with coalgenerated power says Flemming Loekke who heads power trading at Danish company Elektra Energihandel And with moves to integrate Nordic and German electricity planned more exchange trading in contracts for difference will plug the price gaps between coal and hydropower he says With the Scandinavian power trading exchanges being increasingly integrated with other exchanges in northern Europe demand for an instrument to avoid or take on the risk of price anomalies through the bourse may increase If spot prices differ on the same market then indeed there is room for more use of this instrument said Nordpools Kaas But some market dealers are doubtful about the prospects for a derivative that allows some producers with inside information on grid capacity to make gains while those less fortunate bear the risk I am skeptical Some producers have access to privileged information and this could give them market power said Jon Ove Heen a trader at the Norwegian power company Interkraft Derivatives Trade Darts Up In November Our Markets Bureau November Total volumes in the derivatives segment of the Bombay Stock Exchange BSE witnessed an increase of per cent till November to Rs crore from contracts compared with Rs crore from contracts in October The National Stock Exchange NSE also saw a jump in the trading volume in its derivatives segment at Rs crore from contracts till November against Rs crore from contracts in October Manoj Vaish deputy executive director BSE said We expect the derivatives segment to witness a daily trading volume of Rs crore by March Derivatives trading started in June with a modest volume of Rs crore from contracts on the BSE and Rs crore from contracts on the NSE In July on the BSE the volume moved up to Rs crore contracts On the NSE the volume increased to Rs crore contracts Since then the trading volume in the segment has been gradually improving despite the fact that most institutional players are not much active in the segment Analysts point out that another major hurdle in the derivatives sector is the lack of a pricing mechanism for contracts Normally pricing of derivatives is dependent on the interest rates in the country and there are arbitrage opportunities across the debt derivatives and equity markets In the absence of a debt market no proper pricing mechanism has been established yet in the country Arbitrage opportunities are essential for the healthy development of the capital market and today we only have speculators in this segment as hedging is virtually absent owing to the absence of index funds Also arbitrage cannot be done because there is no debt market in the country So only speculation can be done and no market can be developed with mere speculators Hence institutional presence in the derivatives market will take time analysts said Meanwhile the BSE has received new applications for limited trading membership in the derivatives segment This is in addition to the regular members A Treasury Management ASP for FASB and Beyond Derivatives Strategy October By Robert Hunter The implementation date for Financial Accounting Standard was pushed back so many times that corporate treasurers and accountants alike began hoping the elephant in the living room would just go away But now that its finally a reality theyre scrambling to apply the complex rules to flesh and blood accounting reports In spite of the long delays a surprisingly small number of vendors offer products that can even charitably be considered FAS compliant All of which is good news for Revalcom an application service provider trying to bridge the chasm in FAS compliant treasury management systems Reval bills itself as the only Internetbased treasury management system that addresses FAS in any kind of comprehensive way I think its a misnomer for any software company including Reval to say that its FAS compliant says Jiro Okochi CEO and cofounder of Reval The company not the vendor needs to be compliant and its our job to simplify and clarify this task Some vendors may be misleading the end user into thinking that purchasing their software automatically solves all of the companys FAS issues and that is wrong The companys ultimate goal is to help corporate treasurers at Fortune and middlemarket companies centralize their disparate patchwork of treasury management systems and avoid the manually intensive processing associated with these trades by warehousing financial data on the Internet At the moment highfunctionality treasury systems are quite pricey while cheaper systems cover only the generic vanilla structures Reval hopes to fill this gap by offering an affordable webbased solution that covers a broad range of asset classes including derivatives Of course product coverage isnt the only problem facing treasury systems trying to deal with Even if a package accommodated every financial product known to man the Big Five accounting firms each have their own interpretation of the standard and these views may contradict each other Moreover since the Financial Accounting Standards Board is still dealing with Derivatives Implementation Group issues FAS accounting remains a moving target By offering an Internetbased solution instead of a standalone system Reval can adapt to evolutionary changes as decisions are made Simple webbased systems with their common interfaces and unlimited scalability are dearly the wave of the future if not the present But true derivatives functionality is still rare in treasury ASPs and therein lies Revals opportunity For the bigger companies says Okochi were not going to be immediately accepted as a stand alone systems alternative Were going to have to prove ourselves to them Well do this by starting with a derivatives and FAS specialization As people gain awareness and comfort with Revals accomplishments in delivering these sophisticated tasks via an ASP model theyll subscribe to more of our treasury functions across the board Under the new standards all derivatives are markedtomarket on the balance sheet The main challenge for treasurers is to find an underlying hedged item that can also be markedtomarket into earnings to offset the derivatives change in market value Any changes in value that dont match are deemed ineffective and are reflected in a companys earnings As a rule of thumb no one wants variability in derivatives positions to affect earnings As an alternative however a company can try to prove that a derivative hedges a variable cash flow in which case it can be recorded as other comprehensive income OCI directly on the balance sheet with no earnings impact What does this mean for treasury systems In the good old days a company that issued debt could rely on a simple system that monitored the debt portfolio with an entirely separate derivatives accounting function handling the accompanying swap Some bigger companies of course boasted systems that could monitor price and riskmanage the derivative portfolio but such functionality was rare Now because hedges must be priced and tied to the underlying hedged items at an inception integrated derivatives accounting is more critical than ever To address this Reval plans to provide full marktomarket services including pricing models and independent thirdparty market data You can have the best and brightest stars write all the C algorithms you want says Okochi but unless you have good market data going into the models you wont generate a very good price Reval will also match hedges with underlying hedged items and track them throughout their lives as FAS requires The Slow Death Of The FX Salesman Derivatives Strategy October By Barclay T Leib When new technology first started eating up jobs at foreign exchange voice brokers like Garban Intercapital and Cantor Fitzgerald it didnt take long for foreign exchange salespeople at dealer firms to figure out that they were next on the menu The foreign exchange world a huge geographically disperse but ultimately simple twoway market that depends mostly on the speed of executionwas a natural to go electronic And today electronic systems most notably the Electronic Broking Services platform dominate the interbank foreign exchange markets EBS itself now captures more than percent of the daily inter bank trading volume Traditional voice brokers in cash are all but dead Add the Internet age and the pressure only gets worse A dizzying array of new foreign exchange trading platforms such as FXallcom Atriaxcom Currenex and CFOWebcom promise that theyll soon allow clients to do everything from research to execution on the web leaving little room for the humans to work Meanwhile bidoffer spreads are shrinking quicker than a waif model for Calvin Klein The official line from the banks even as they go electronic is that theres still an important role for salespeople to play Good salespeople are still essential to cement client dealing relationships they say What salespeople might lose in spread revenue moreover can be made up by revenue from greater volume and sales of structured products Banks even say that electronic trading is a good thing for the salesfolks The more sales and trades done electronically the more time salespeople have to analyze markets and cook up profitable sophisticated hedging strategies It also means they have more time to prospect for new clients which should be great news for the salespeople Who wants to be stuck in the office with five telephones on two ears when you could be out wining and dining But does anyone really believe that Do the banks have a truly cogent game plan to sort all this out At the very least what new qualities must salespeople now possess to hold down a job Given that foreign exchange is ahead of other capital markets in its use of electronic price delivery the answer to these questions could set the tone for the future of all Wall Street salespeople So listen carefully I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW First it is important to put things in perspective What exactly are the facts for foreign sales staffs Fact one The recent spate of bank megamergers means that fewer banks are trading foreign exchange Moreover big banks seem to be getting bigger and more powerful in this area while the small ones are slowly falling by the wayside Banks like KBC Deutscheland Daiwa and Nikko have all dosed their spot foreign exchange trading in London SGCowen New York has laid off part of its corporate sales force and DG Bank recently shut down foreign exchange trading in New York At the same time after aggressively re cruising new salespeople in Deutsche Bank has stolen market share even from the likes of UBS Warburg and JP Morgan The latter institutions reported lower foreign ex change volumes and profitability during the year and specifically cited foreign exchange as an overall drag on their corporate profitability JPMorgan will soon be folded into Chase and a nascent foreign exchange effort at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette will soon be absorbed into Credit Suisse First Boston According to headhunters resumes from both Morgan and DLJ have already hit the street In short the number of bank players is down and bank foreign exchange volumes have been static to slightly lower in the year Fact two Since the introduction of the euro last year there are fewer currencies to trade In the words of Adam Sorab a former Londonbased foreign exchange salesman at CSFB The Rubix cube of currency risk management has been reduced to a much simpler matchtheshape type puzzle With no more lira peseta or other fringeEuropean currencies to worry about risk management has generally become simpler Without fringe currencies to worry about and trade many previously spreadable opportunities for the banks have also flown out the window Fact three There are fewer customers Large macro hedge fund managers and commercial speculators have for a variety of reasons stopped trading the way they used to This may have more to do with losses in other macro bets gone awry in equity markets and elsewhere as opposed to problems within the foreign exchange market itself But for whatever reason it is making the business a tougher one for salespeople According to one Londonbased salesperson The foreign exchange market used to have three prongs to it the hedge funds the commercial speculative community and the commercial hedging community Now with the demise of Tiger Management and the downsizing of George Soros Quantum Fund some of the biggest clients have simply disappeared Speculative commercial accounts such as French corporates Batif Aerospatiale and Thompson have also largely stopped trading in the aggressive style of yesteryear This still leaves the commercial hedgers with simple tradeflow repatriation but foreign exchange in general is now a much lonelier and thinner market The only recent players with any stepup in activity are the banks doing oneoff hedging for large MA activities and global equity managers rebalancing their portfolios and currency exposures says this salesman If you dont see those flows youre dead Almost everyone else is gone Hes particularly incensed because the year has brought some goodsized moves in the market Weve gone from to in l the euro Deutsche markyen for us oldtimers has fallen off the charts to But nobody cares The hedge fund community is not around Its mindboggling Fact four Salary and bonus levels are stagnant Gone are the days of the megadeal with big guaranteed bonuses says Elaine de Flores president of the recruiting firm de Flores International in Stamford Conn Some guarantees are still given but its not like the old days You really have to produce put your money where your mouth is to get paid De Flores thoughts are echoed by foreign exchange recruiting specialist Kenny Blonder senior vice president of Integrated Management Resources in Tempe Ariz Salary levels have been flat he says The highest paid salesperson might make tops as a base salary these days COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS So whats the good news Well salespeople may be surviving better than some traders are Blonder says that in the last two years hes placed strategists economists quantitative people and a few salespeople but he hasnt been able to place a single currency trader during that time Ecommerce and the EBS may be even tougher on the traders than the salespeople says Blonder No one calls out to do spot business anymore Volume is just done on the machine With the new platforms one guy can watch more currencies at the same time You dont need hoards of trading staff Having said that there are still two factors keeping demand for salespeople firm for now First according to de Flores banks still want a few rainmakers who bring a book of clients with them when changing firms All recruiters are looking for the same person she says He or she must have a loyal customer base that is transferable and must be wellversed in derivatives and other markets as well as foreign exchange The interview process has also grown lengthier and fussier Banks want to see more people So while theres still a demand its not easy to dose a deal The second factor is ironically excessive and premature pessimism over the future of the business A New York foreign exchange salesperson notes that Because the death bells of this business were rung so loudly and so early no fresh new blood has come into foreign exchange for three or four years maybe longer Unfortunately he does not think this will help over the long term I dont think were all going to die but I think we will be in a reducedsalary advisory role he says I certainly cant promise to bring anyone a given amount of turnover and profitability anymore The business no longer works that way LOOKING FOR THE PATH OUT Given all of the above what is the average foreign exchange salesperson or trader supposed to do The threadbare spreads are prompting a lot of people to contemplate switching careers Up to two years ago I could make million in spread revenue for my institution in a good year says one salesman at a UKbased bank This year Ill be lucky to make million Thats still enough to keep my job but Im working harder now to take home far less money If something better came along Id take it De Flores confirms that this is the overall attitude I cant tell you how often I get a phone call from some foreign exchange person asking What do I do Where do I go How do I reinvent myself she says Women in particular are getting out of the business in droves taking the attitude that it is not worth it to come in day after day chasing the same small group of customers I dont mean to sound sexist at all but they are leaving the industry either to go home and take care of the kids or do something completely different sometimes in businesstobusiness commerce Theres really a dearth of women in the industry now Men unfortunately dont quite have that luxury of just packing it in More often they are forced to at least try sticking it out De Flores specifically says that many traders quarttypes and structurers inquire about the buy or equityside of the business Theyd be there in a heartbeat if I had more of these positions says de Flores But while business may be getting more difficult at the margin people are still holding onto their jobs for now mainly because no may be the worst time to jump ship to another firm As always its easier to fill a position going up the chain than down says Blonder People are always happy to step up to a Chase Citi or Goldman as opposed to moving down to a smaller bank But those making the step up know that if they dont perform once they get there they risk not having a seat anywhere at all WHERE TO GO To survive within the industry itself a foreign exchange salesperson today needs to know more than how to spread spot and forward foreign exchange trades Whats required is a strategic ability to transact orders in a variety of markets and to solve problems for clients using derivatives Threeway option deals are still going to require the human touch for quite awhile to come says one recruiter who is still bullish on the prospects for quality people within foreign currency sales Salespeople not capable of reinventing themselves also might find a niche selling the very technology that threatens them We may end up with two distinct groups of sales people muses Craig Puffenberger managing director in charge of foreign exchange trading at CSFB One handling complex trades and advisory functions while the other just services the portal In the meantime to those thinking of leaving the business altogether Ian Dow president of Dow Consultants in New York advises Youre going to have to reinvent yourself a bit retrain maybe take a pay cut According to Blonder There are jobs in ecommerce tech companies and foreign exchange trading software vendors and I have made a few placements there The only problem is that while many of these companies pay a competitive salary they usually dont come dose on a bonus basis Notwithstanding that caveat electronic trading platform Currenex has recently lured several first class veteran sales people to its offices hiring both Keith Hill from JP Morgans London office and Kendra Wisler formerly of UBS Warburg Perhaps stock options did the trick Others have found positions on the buyside Laura Munisteri a veteran foreign exchange trader options specialist and salesperson formerly of Deutsche Banks Frankfurt office joined the United Nations Common Fund in before moving in to join the global corporate treasury area at Philips AG Others have headed into consulting One individual with a strong foreign exchange and treasury background decided in that the time had come to hang up his sellside boots He started out as a senior consultant at a Big Five accounting firm and says hes never regretted the switch To make any real money as a consultant you have to become a partner he says And even though I did not have the credentials to come in at that level back then Im much closer to that objective now Ive taken my capitalmarkets expertise and been able to apply it to a whole slew of new businesses these days largely in the dotcoin world Others have gone into the regulatory agencies Ernest Eckersdorf who spent most of a sevenyear career at Citibank running corporate foreign exchange sales and then played a similar role at Societe Generale for eight years now acts as a supervising risk management specialist for the New York State Banking Department I get to see a wide crosssection of institutions from the top down he says It is actually quite enlightening and professionally its extremely satisfying There is simply no comparison between what I do now and the single lowmargin product that foreign exchange has become Meanwhile Sorab formerly of Credit Suisse foreign exchange sales leapt at an opportunity in when Credit Suisse and CS First Boston merged their foreign exchange efforts to shift his focus He moved into the hedge fund marketing and investor relations group of CSFBs leveraged funds group Four years later he is happy he did that Sorab is soon to become a director of European sales at Deutsche Asset Managements absolute returns group in London I still have a great many friends in foreign exchange and many of them are looking to get out if they can he says Lastly we find Christina Engelchor formerly a year ABN Amro foreign exchange salesperson now happily at home in Nagele The Netherlands with her fouryear old son Cees I enjoyed what I was doing for a long time says Engelchor But then the technology started getting better and the clients more astute Foreign exchange became too competitive Moneymaking opportunities were declining just as my personal priorities were changing Being a woman working in Europe within a maleoriented business also wasnt always particularly easy Sometimes I felt like I was the only female member of a European football team So there you have it The impending death of the foreign exchange salesman was predicted by some as early as and has been acknowledged by more and more since then Some banking models are less threatening see Wells Fargo Takes a Novel Approach Page and a good salesperson who can also act as a strategist and derivatives expert will likely survive But the very nature of ecommerce puts the pressure on the bottom line and as that pressure builds look for the sales community to change almost as much as the voice braking community has While banks are loathe to admit it shedding expensive foreign exchange sales staff and excess traders may be the only way they can survive and profit as etrading truly begins to burgeon Everyone has access to EBS now even if they are not supposed to says a European salesman The banks are themselves a major disservice by providing such transparency If this continues within two years all flow transaction will go from a companys corporate headquarters directly into an electronic system bypassing salesman The only exception will be very largesized trades and structured optionsoriented trading Its obvious were not necessary anymore agrees a Chicagobased salesperson as cheerily

Need For Change Now Rate Derivatives Is Top Performer Capital Concerns Enron To Expand Weather Derivatives Cover Uneven Progress Asia Risk November By Quentin Hills The derivatives markets across Asia continue to develop in terms of maturity and complexity However as has been the case over the past five years this development has been neither homogeneous or consistent Before considering the future landscape it is worth reviewing the various phases of the market during the last few years During the early to mid s the main activity comprised currency and interest rate transactions in the major currencies The market was dominated by a handful of foreign financial institutions while local currency business was limited and activity was for the most part evenly distributed throughout the region The regulatory environment was mixed and generally not well defined or comprehensive Increasingly during this period the transactions became more speculative in line with global trendsand the inevitable occurred in the first quarter of As interest rates quickly reversed de rose in February there were several wellpublicised losses both in the region and globally There were quick and adverse consequences on the derivatives markets Activity abruptly slowed speculative transactions ceased and financial institutions that had been active pulled back at least temporarily Globally the focus turned towards discipline and control and there was a flurry of new derivatives guidelines and regulations Asian regulators responded with new guidelines which largely followed international practice During this period the industry represented by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and regulators from all countries developed strong relationships These relationships continue to this day and result in increasing industry comments during the drafting of new regulations As derivatives markets began to recover players returned and new entrants emerged local currency markets developed strongly and endusers focused on risk management processes Nevertheless despite the lack of highly leveraged structures companies throughout the region continued to fund longterm local currency investments with shorter term foreign currency cheaper liabilities both in the cash markets and synthetic derivatives When the Asian Crisis struck the impact was severe and the toll heavy Apart from deals being unwound activity ceased and liquidity disappeared Since the crisis derivatives markets have recovered with a marked increase in activity although not to precrisis levels the return of market makers and the introduction of new products such as credit derivatives Going forward the market seems poised to resume strong growth as Asia emerges from this difficult period Breadth and depth of participants A consequence of the crisis was a sharp and significant fall in counterparty creditworthiness across the region and the withdrawal of many market makers This was particularly acute during the height of the crisis but is reversing as foreign banks once again become more active and local banks build their derivatives capabilities Corporate credit quality is slowly improving and a recent trend has been the increasing use of derivatives by financial institutions particularly local banks and fund managers This is expected to continue as more active portfolio management leads to a focus on yield enhancement and credit risk management Additionally there has been an ongoing mend among endusers of markedly improved understanding and use of derivatives in risk management Also noticeable is the broader application of new products For example local financial institutions are using credit derivatives to manage balance sheet risk strategically both for liabilities and assets This reflects the efficiencies available through the correct use of derivatives and increasing sophistication of endusers Domestic bond markets The emergence of domestic bond markets is having a positive impact on market development both directly and indirectly There is a direct impact where bond issues are swapped into a different currency in the case of foreign issuers accessing a market or interest rate where issuers wish to alter the interest rate basis Additionally the increased availability of instruments in the market and greater demand for product from investors is leading to new local currency products such as options on domestic interest rates and securities Regulatory convergence Finally derivatives regulation in the region has generally been somewhat mixed with some countries adopting a prescriptive approach and others a riskbased approach Prior to the Asian Crisis there was a trend towards convergence and harmonization with respect to regulation During the crisis however new regulatory initiatives were put on hold as countries managed larger and more pressing issues The response to the economic turmoil elicited different responses concerning currency convertibility Naturally where currency controls were imposed either in part or in full there was a direct adverse impact on the local derivatives market However in those countries where the response has been to keep markets open or even to restructure the local financial markets derivatives usage has rebounded quickly This in turn requires further regulatory consideration which has generally been in line with international standards Going forward it is reasonable to expect a mend towards regulatory harmonization and increasing adoption of international regulatory standards The derivatives markets in Asia have undergone dramatic changes over the last few years The markets themselves are far from homogeneous and significant progress has been made from a low base There has been continual progress as the number of users increases more products become available and regulations put in place to allow healthy market development Development has not been uniform across the region nor has it been consistent over time as evidenced by the setbacks brought about by the Asian Crisis Nevertheless the derivatives markets in Asia will continue to develop and mature as endusers grow in number and sophistication while the range of products continues to expand German Derivatives Legislation A Need For Change Now Derivatives Week November In a global economy it is essential that each country establish a transparent and efficient regulatory system for financial products To ensure market stability governments must also instill a high degree of confidence m the legal system In relation to overthecounter derivatives transactions these goals have not yet been fully achieved in Germany But with the forthcoming Fourth Financial Markets Enhancement Act Finanzmarktfrderungsgesetz there might be light at the end of the tunnel In this context it makes sense to look at a muchneeded change in the legal regulation of the so called Borsentermingeschaft ENFORCEABILITY Generally a party to a derivatives contract under German law could attempt to challenge the validity of the agreement by raising a statutory defense the gaming or betting defense sec of the Civil Code Burgerliches Gesetzbuch the margin defense sec of the Civil Code or the futures defense sec of the Exchange Act Borsengesetz However there are two ways to possibly avoid the threat of such defenses i the contract in question could qualify as a hedging transaction or ii as a so called exchange traded futures agreement Borsentermingeschaft HEDGING Under the hedging exception a derivatives transaction is valid enforceable and not subject to the gaming betting or margin defense either if it constitutes a hedge for both parties or if the transaction is a hedge for one party and if this party believes without negligence that the transaction constitutes a hedge for the other party as well The term hedge in this context covers microhedging strategies Whether this exception is also true with respect to macrohedging strategies is not entirely dear Modern legal authors tend not to use the term hedging exception anymore but more broadly refer to economically justified transactions BORSENTERMINGESCHAFTE According to the Exchange Act sec pare Borsentermingeschafte are binding on both parties if each party is a merchant and is either registered or not subject to registration because heit is a foreign resident or a public law entity or a professional defined as a person who at the time of the transaction or prior thereto traded in futures commercially or professionally or is permanently admitted to engage in exchangetrading If only one party qualifies under the relevant provision of the Exchange Act a futures transaction is enforceable only if one party is subject to statutory banking or exchange supervision be it in Germany or abroad and informs the other party in writing of the risks inherent in the derivatives transactions in question standardized information papers which pursuant to German Supreme Court Bundesterichtshof case law satisfy the requirements under the Exchange Act and were created by the industry federations of the German banks This technique of entering a valid agreement is commonly referred to as the information model and is subject to strict and ongoing form requirements In addition the transaction in question must qualify as a Borsentermingeschaft Unfortunately this term has never been statutorily defined but is intended to cover new types of transactions and has thus to be interpreted in a broad sense Moreover the Exchange Act was amended in to extend the privilege of its sec to transactions with a similar financial purpose as exchangetraded futures transactions Therefore today most types of financial commodity energy and credit derivatives whether stock exchange traded or OTC products are generally eligible for falling under sec of the Exchange Act Despite the vast amount of case law almost exclusively in the context of warrants on this matter there is still some uncertainty as to whether certain OTC derivatives qualify as Borsenterningeschdffe within the meaning of this provision RELIEF THE FOURTH FINANCIAL MARKETS ENHANCEMENT ACT It is however widely expectedor at least hoped that the forthcoming Fourth Financial Markets Enhancement Act will include the introduction of a statutory definition of Borsentermingeschafte A legislative initiative to define Borsentermingeschafte in concrete terms would be helpful not least because the German Supreme Court seems in its more recent judgments to have entirely given up the attempt to bring such transactions within its own traditional definition attempts and now lays emphasis only on the financial purpose necessary for qualification as a Borsentermingeschafte The term also requires clarification in light of recent amendments to the Securities Trading Act Wertpapierhandelsgesetz and the Banking Act Kreditwesengesetz implementing into German law the EC Investment Services Directive ISD and the EC Capital Adequacy Directive CAD which introduced the distinguishable supervisory law term derivative narrowly defined into the two acts The term Borsentermingeschaft is not used internationally it is specific to Germany Its conceptual scope is controvasial and the continuous development of new types of transactions requires a provision which is as comprehensive as possible For this reason it makes sense to find a legal definition which includes existing derivatives and can accommodate new developments Moreover the essential point of a derivative is the dependence of its price upon the development of its underlyings Securities moneymarket instruments currencies units of account interest rates or other yields as well as commodities power and precious metals may all be assets underlying derivatives transactions as defined in for example the Securities Trading Act and the Banking Act In addition the inclusion of other underlyings such as credit events weather developments traffic flows and environmental emissions would be desirable in order to ensure that here too validity defenses are essentially eliminated A broad definition of a Borsentermingeschafte would remedy the existing lack of public confidence in the law especially with regard to future developmentsand thus would enhance the status of Finanzplatz Deutschland The German banking associations and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association should be supported by all market participants in air attempts to convince the German legislator to make a broad definition of Borsentermingeschafte a reality as soon as possible Rate Derivatives Is Top Performer Australian Financial Review November By Bill McConnell An explosion in the use of interest rate derivatives particularly forward rate agreements and swaps has been the standout feature of Australian financial markets this year alongside strong growth in nongovernment debt securities However a slump in foreign exchange transactions resulted in an overall decline in total financial markets turnover The Australian Financial Markets Association in conjunction with the Securities Industry Research Centre of AsiaPacific released the results of its annual report on trading in Australian financial instruments yesterday The report detailed statistical results of Australian overthecounter and exchange traded market activity Traded contracts in Australian financial instruments totaled trillion with the bulk of trading taking place on overthecounter markets which contributed per cent of total market turnover The two markets to show substantial declines in trading activity were foreign exchange and options on futures with yearly volumes down per cent in FX markets and per cent in SFE traded options The fall in activity in currency trading the first since led to an overall decline in market turnover of per cent The total turnover on the Australian Stock Exchange options and direct equities was billion or a little over percent of total market volume But the meager contribution provided by equity markets masked an impressive per cent increase on volumes from levels last year and a per cent increase in exchange traded options Market capitalisation in the Australian sharemarket also increased by per cent to billion The report identified not only a growth in share trading but also a changing investor profile This growth in investor participation in the market does not mean larger volumes It also means there is a growing number of more experienced investors seeking a broader range of investment products In addition the growth in superannuation funds in Australia is placing greater demand on investment products The challenge for exchanges is to meet these growing demands But the top performer in Australian financial markets this year was interest rate derivatives Use of forward rate agreements more than doubled during the year to trillion making it the fastest growing market segment for the year Nongovernment debt securities repurchase agreements and swaps experienced growth in turnover between and percent Swap turnover has increased every year since data was first collected in Turnover in swap markets has increased each year for four years and that has been happening irrelevant of economic circumstances said Mr Gordon Axford chairman of the Swaps Committee This has been a function of greater use of capital markets and an increased borrowing requirement by the corporate sector requiring the use of swaps to hedge exposure Mr Ken Farrow chief executive officer of AFMA said it had been an astonishing turnaround by interest rate markets after FRA markets appeared to be in decline in The interest rate market was more volatile this year than last and that means there was greater underlying customer demand for interest rate hedging said Mr Farrow Trading in government debt securities fell for the fourth consecutive year and while the traded volumes fell by only per cent the trend suggests a creeping supply gap between government and corporate markets Corporate issuance has really come into its own said Mr Phil Coates AFMA debt capital markets committee chairman The market has advanced considerably People are very much in tune with what is on offer and we have seen the expansion of the corporate floating rate note market But Mr Brad Scott vicepresident head of fixed income credit research at Salomon Smith Barney said while the corporate bond market was of equal size to the semigovernment sector the liquidity of the government bond market still far outstripped the corporate market by a factor of more than three As funds inflow continues to outstrip demand deal sizes particularly in the triple B land will need to continue to increase to attract offshore demand and encourage broadbased turnover growth Similarly greater issue diversity and liquidity provided by global credit markets will continue to attract more interest from funds who have money to place and cant wait for the market to grow KEY POINTS Australian financial markets turnover was trillion for the year Turnover in forward rate agreements increased by percent the fastest growing market segment Foreign exchange trading fell per cent the first fall since Trading in government debt securities fell for the fourth consecutive year down per cent Capital Concerns Risk November By Oliver Bennett There are plenty of people who believed it would or should never happen But early next year regulators are expected to announce a tier one capital charge for operational risk Bankers who have worked closely with the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision say it is likely to recommend three different options for banking supervisors basic indicators that is a single proxy for the entire bank such as trading volumes a business line approach using Committeeimposed capital ratio or thirdly internal measurement using a banks own loss data within a supervisory specified framework The implication is that further and more detailed work on the internal measurement approach may result an the development of appropriate models and a fourth regulatory option based on internal modelling There has been intense criticism from banks about an operational risk capital charge through industry groups such as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA and the British Bankers Association BBA However the Committees consistent position on a capital charge for other risks is encouraging initiatives to develop methodologies and coiled data related to managing operational risk Standardisation is some way off although there is growing industry agreement on a core operational risk definition the collection and sharing of internal loss data and the importance of qualitative criteria The proposal took banks by surprise the absence of a standard methodology led to fears of an arbitrary operational risk charge supplementary to existing capital charges for credit and market risk based on size and volume Allen Wheat chief executive officer and chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston speaking at Risks annual European congress in Paris last April described the proposal for an operational risk capital charge as the dopiest thing Ive ever seen Other leading banks like JP Morgan also expressed concern that an operational risk capital charge was premature when the industry had not come to an agreement on how important the issue was or how to measure it A ruleofthumb measurement would not accurately reflect different levels of risk in various banks and could result in overcharging some banks for risk and undercharging others Similarly operational risk capital charges could penalise banks competing against nonbanking organisations not subject to the charge The principal message to regulators is that larger banks with good operational risk measurement and management should achieve lower capital charges However without a standardised methodology proposed operational risk capital charge criteria need to be progressive flexible and include a riskbased option Joseph Sabitini managing director in the corporate risk management group at JP Morgan in New York recognises that a new regulatory framework for operational risk must accommodate banks at all levels of sophistication in terms of risk measurement and management but that it also includes a riskbased option for those with the appropriate capability Sabitini who has been working closely with the Risk Management Group of the Committee goes on to say that to avoid the shortcomings of the previous Accord the capital rules must also be transparent uniform and consistency applied A recent report by Meridien Research the Massachusettsbased technology and advisory service concludes that in two to three years only onethird of financial institutions will have the technology to measure and manage their operational risks The report examines how financial institutions measure up in a fourstage progression of addressing and implementing an operational risk management strategy In the first stage firms concentrate on the identification of key risk Indicators and data collection Stage two involves developing metrics and tracking for the identified risks from stage one Stages three and four move on to using technology for the measurement and management of those risks within a firm The report gods on to say that most firms are working in stages one and two of the operational risk management process With the regulatory option to focus on specific business lines such as investment banking retail banking or asset management banks are concentrating on internal definitions and management strategies But how are they preparing for a capital charge For most banks this includes lossgathering initiatives key indicator information risk assessment and in some cases calculation However unlike market risk and credit risk a purely quantitative approach to measure operational risk is not the current focus Chris Rachlin head of group operational risk at Royal Bank of Scotland RBS details the main initiatives his group have been focusing on We have been identifying and implementing tools and techniques to help our businesses identify manage and monitor operational risks better As part of this we have been collecting data on loss events We have also looked at a number of quantification techniques but believe their effectiveness will depend on the quality and quantity of the data available The current challenge is to find a way around the lack of data on big loss experiences Due to the rarity of these large losses banks lack extensive data on operational catastrophes such as Nick Leesonstyle fraud or a complete systems breakdown According to Tony Peccia vicepresident in the operational risk management division at CIBC World Markets in Toronto most banks would want to be at the internal measurement stage of the proposed capital charge when implemented which is dependent on internal data This has led to the establishment of a number of operational loss databases in particular introduction consortia of internal loss databases The two principal consortia are the Multinational Operational Risk Exchange managed by NetRisk and the Global Operational Loss Database Gold managed by the BBA which both provide a mechanism to share loss data in a secure environment The consortium members supply operational loss data business and risk characteristics to the managing agents The data is sanitised secured and scaled then returned to the consortium members As well as assisting banks to manage their operational risks the data can be used to compare their performance against their competitors and highlight vulnerable areas The More consortium has agreed to begin sharing data from November and receive the first batch of scrubbed anonymous data by the end of the year There are a number of concerns regarding data standards According to Richard Metcalfe ISDA Assistant Director of European Policy There is concern that while the proposed Basle Committee rules incentivise data gathering that is not the only issued if banks record their losses in general categories when submitting internal data but do not associate losses with enough contextual information it we be difficult to understand the finer gradations of risk later on or indeed to reclassify the database to an agreed industry or regulatory standard Matt Kimber a director with Arthur Andersens financial practice welcomes initiatives to collect internal loss data to increase the breadth of information available However he goes on to say that users of the information will have to be mindful of the parameters as to how the information is gathered and prepared Similar criticisms are also levelled at publicly disclosed external loss databases where issues of caring and cleansing must be considered Last month ISDA issued a discussion paper Operational Risk Regulatory Approach Discussion on operational risk capital charges The paper highlights concerns that a purely quantitative approach could enable institutions with poor operational risk management processes and controls but with access to internal loss event data to achieve a lower capital charge that institutions with stronger risk management processes but no access to internal loss event data The paper also highlights fears over the method of calculation of operational risk capital for an institution that has recently experienced serious loss but where management has reacted and strengthened the control environment in that area and consequently reduced the likelihood of reoccurrence The paper produced with the active support of over ISDA member firms and facilitated by PriceWaterhouseCoopers sets out a series of structured and transparent qualitative assessment criteria with particular reference to quantitative criteria to complement the operational risk data requirements currency proposed by regulators The paper argues blat there is strong support in the industry for a regulatory capital assessment model that allows institutions managing operational risk to effectively access a more precise means of Calculating an operational risk capital charge institutions should benefit from more sophisticated controls and the regulatory regime should establish incentives to improve risk management and controls This is consistent with proposed quantative techniques once internal loss data is incorporated into the operational risk capital charge calculation as any institution with an effective control environment would normally expect to have a lower loss experience and thus a lower capital charge According to Arthur Andersens Kimber there is another option insurance Insurance and risk transfer will become an important and sophisticated component in an operational risk managers toolbox over the next few years There are definitely challenges for insurance providers in offering operational risk cover but there has been some recent headway in the last year or two In fact regulators have made it clear that in principle mechanisms such as insurance might be an acceptable way for banks to mitigate risk and reduce their capital charges Depending on the stance of regulators the Committee might insist that policies that mitigate the capital charge pay out immediately after any operational disaster or that these polices only cover certain classes of operational risk It may also stipulate a specified credit rating of the insurance company or the percentage of risk that the primary insurer can sell into the wider insurance market Possibly the most wellknown operational risk insurance product is Swiss Res Financial Institutions Operational Risk Insurance Fiord With Fidelity Investments as the first client for the reinsurance firms product it is designed for the top financial institutions in the world FIORI would have covered most of the devastating losses that have hit the headlines over the last few years of them according to the insurers own analysis Lars SchmidtOtt head of global banking practice at Swiss Re New Markets sees insurance as a good alternative to capital charges Holding Capital on the balance sheet is not good for shareholder value if you can keep it off the balance sheet at an efficient price you only pay the downside premium But according to RBSs Rachlin there are a number of problems with the insurance option principally the speed of payment and potential lack of capacity for meaningful levels of rover from financially secure insurers Although some products on the market will provide immediate liquidity to a bank following a disaster there may be certain arguments after the event Policies with catastrophe levels of cover would also need to be scheduled or layered and it is not always possible to secure acceptance for finely worded polices from differed underwriters Rachlin also highlights reputational issues While insurance may cover the shortterm financial impact for some events the longer term reputation impact can be of greater concern Although SchmidtOtt does not agree that there are any reputational issues using insurance products he recognises that it may be some time before gaining relief from operational risk charges becomes a real incentive to take out insurance Insurance will play a role as an instrument for managing operational risk but not in its current formwe are waiting for the regulators Insurance aside the Basle Committees capital charge announcement for operational risk is not eagerly awaited If the regulators make their announcements in the first quarter of they probably would not become effective until at least Depending on the flexibility of the proposals research into internal modelling approaches to operational risk is likely to intensify Victor Dowd an associate involved with operational risk capital charge discussion at the UKs Financial Services Authority agrees that further and more detailed work on the internal measurement approach may result in the development of appropriate models However for the present he says modelling is not an option for the regulators to consider Enron To Expand Weather Derivatives Cover Derivatives Week November Enron Europe is set to start quoting weather derivatives on an additional cities in Europe in the next two weeks Thor Lien vp and head of weather risk managementEurope

Equity Derivatives Growth Lures US Banks To Europe German Electricity Market Set For Growth EuroMPs Seek Reform Delay Exchange Mergers To Encourage Derivatives Markets Asia Risk November Malaysias derivatives markets are set for big changes after December This is now the mostly likely date for the merger between the Commodity and Monetary Exchange of Malaysia Commex The amalgamation will bring together all the countrys exchangelisted futures and options trading Completion of the merger also seems likely to lead to the launch of several new derivatives contracts which had been put on hold pending the union Kloffe which is owned by the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange currently lists just one contract futures on the KLSE composite share index Commex is itself the result of a merger in late between the year old Commodity Exchange offering palm oil contracts and the Malaysian Monetary Exchange which began operating in to provide three month klibor futures The need to rationalise Malaysias exchanges and cut costs are the main reasons for the merger according to Allan Au Yond head of business development at Commex This rationalisation is being strongly pushed by the government as part of its broader plans for consolidation in the financial sector Although volumes have fallen on both the Kloffe and Commex since controls were imposed in September Au Yond says this is not the key factor in amalgamation In any case activity on the Commex is rebounding he says A new name for the combined exchange has not been decided After the proposed December merger the trading of all futures and options will be located in the stock exchange building All trading will also be electronic At present Kloffe trades on screen but Commex still uses the openoutcry system According to Commex officials they will be seeking approval for a bond futures contract to compliment the shortterm klibor one Kolfe meanwhile is planning to launch options on the composite share index before the end of the year Exchange officials would also like to launch options on individual shares However this will have to wait until the authorities lift the ban on short selling and the lending of shares Such practices were banned in August during the Asian Crisis although short positions on composite index futures are allowed At that time excessive shortselling was blamed for the sharp drop in share prices While the ban exists options on individual shares would be unlikely to find much investor interest Another launch proposal under consideration is a futures contract on an Islamic index covering shares acceptable under Shari law Kloffe was hit quite badly by the imposition of foreign exchange controls in September Until trading volumes had been rising The early days of East Asias crisis inevitably created heaving trading with monthly contract volumes peaking at in June The average monthly volume in the first half of this year has not been much more than a third of that level This is hardly surprising Foreigners accounted for about of the Kloffe turnover in This year the proportion is down to as foreign equity investors deserted the country once the repatriation controls were relaxed New equity portfolio investment from overseas remains low Along with other Asian markets the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange has seen a sharp fall in share prices in In the year to early October the Malaysia dollar returns index compiled by Standard Poors IFC was showing a fall of almost But this was only half the drop seen across much of the region which posted an average slide of Share price performances this year partially reverse the strong advances made in when the Malaysian market climbed and gains in Asia averaged Equity Derivatives Growth Lures US Banks To Europe IFR November By Elisabeth Bertalanffy US investment banks including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch are stepping up their bid to win equity derivatives business in Continental Europe after a boom year One area in which they are aiming to win market share from European banks is the sale of derivatives Alastair Cooper managing director in the equity group at MSDW in London said that the bank has increased the headcount in its European equity derivatives operations by this year and is planning to add roughly the same number next year The vast majority of these hires have been and will be on the marketing side The client functionality side such as research has also been boosted The bank is also preparing to roll out an improved technology platform early next year which will provide sophisticated online facilities for its clients According to Cooper the bank has invested a lot in the platform which offers for example stateoftheart risk management and execution management systems and also in improving its infrastructure Over the last few years MSDW has been rapidly building up headcount and resources across virtually all product lines in Europe Equity derivatives however had been lagging behind in this expansion drive Cooper explained owing in part to prioritization and risk appetite considerations Last year the banks management made the decision significantly to expand MSDWs European equity derivatives business with a special commitment to carving out a market position in the mushrooming local retail markets The decision was driven by several factors according to Cooper First MSDW wanted to leverage its strength in related areas such as its equity cash highnetworth individuals and mergers and acquisitions businesses he said Also the bank is extremely optimistic on economic prospects in Europe which it believes point to further growth in equity derivatives volumes in the near future Additionally Cooper noted that the range and sophistication of equity products has been steadily increasing especially in the retail sector with strong growth in singlename and sectoral products One of the most important elements in MSDWs foray into the European equity derivatives and retail arena where so far the bank has not left much of a mark is its efforts on the technology side This is especially important for retail clients whom the bank can now reach directly MSDWs interest in the retail market has been sparked by the considerable increase in the volume of equity and equitylinked products in this area Cooper pointed to the advanced warrant and certificate markets across Europe as well as to the breadth of alternative assets like funds of hedge funds The retail market is becoming more and more sophisticated and the product offering wider and more complex he said Internet trading is furthering this trend because it makes it so easy to deal Merrill Lynch has been targeting the European retail market for some time now and is one of the largest US players on the Continent The bank is managing to leverage off its strong position in the US equity markets to compete with European banks and has also been willing to commit large numbers of staff and significant investment in technology to make a name for itself Merrill strongly emphasises the ecommerce side of the business currently offering a dozen product sites in eight languages around the world in Europe it provides sites for Italian German and UK clients and a fully integrated global product menu From this month its online site allows for the trading of warrants and certificates On the retail side in Europe the bank already offers a range of equitylinked products including certificates and LDRs tracker shares jointly developed with European stock exchanges and STOXX On its certificate platform the bank more than doubled issuance in Europe this year It has also rolled its successful US HOLDRS product out in Europe It is among the market leaders in warrants and listed options Aside from the welldeveloped Swiss and German markets Spain and Italy are also promising retail arenas for the future MSDWs acquisition of Spanish firm AB Asesores last year will provide a valuable launching pad for the banks foray into this market as it provides it with an extensive retail brokerage presence Cooper said At the same time it is expanding its credit card business in Europe and stepping up direct braking and marketing he added Cooper acknowledged that it would be difficult to compete against established retail market players like Deutsche Bank and UBS Warburg on their home turf MSDW will thus focus on niche sectors and will also take advantage of its strengths like its leading role in the technology sector The bank will also be able to add value in nonEuropean indices and sectors Banks that want to be successful in the European retail markets have to recognise that it is a staffintensive low margin highvolume business Merrill for example has equity derivatives salespeople worldwide and a staggering retail financial consultants Another crucial element is a strong technology platform which is costly and takes time to set up It remains to be seen if other US houses which have traditionally been strong in equity derivatives are willing to take the plunge into the retail market Goldman Sachs for example has so far focused primarily on the highmargin business of large institutional clients using fewer staff to cover large areas of the market However the European equity derivatives retail market has been going strong for some time now and shows no signs of slowing down It would come as no surprise if more US players were to push into the sector soon German Electricity Market Set For Growth IFR November The German electricity derivatives market is expected to grow tenfold over the next four years a development that will be helped by the startup of several electricity spot and futures exchanges Last month the European Energy Exchange EEX started simulating energy futures trades with market participants including banks and regional and international electricity providers according to an EEX spokesman in Frankfurt The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is also targeting the German as well as the Dutch electricity futures market in cooperation with the Hanover commodity exchange And the Leipzig Power Exchange LPX is planning to roll out futures trading in the first half of next year An official at a leading German energy company said that volume in the electricity forwards market in Germany is currently only about Em per year By however the company forecasts volumes of up to Em times as much The vast majority of these trades are done overthecounter His company currently trades forwards futures swaps and options as well as hybrid products linked to the prices of commodities whose production is very energy consuming such as aluminum Tenors are usually a year Liquidity is still lagging behind even in the spot markets EEX which launched electricity spot trading in August has average weekly trading volumes of roughly megawatt hours Rival LPX trades roughly half that amount In the derivatives arena the major players are investment banks like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and international power companies like Enron or Hess as well as local electricity company RWE But all the signs are there that the electricity derivatives market is poised to take off The official pointed to the fact that the market for qualified energy derivatives personnel such as traders as well as legal and compliance experts is completely exhausted It shows how everybody is looking to build up or strengthen their capabilities in this business he said adding that his company also is looking for International Swaps and Derivatives Association documentation experts A twopronged approach is necessary to foster the energy derivatives market the official stressed First it is important to conduct education and information campaigns to draw smaller players into the market and lobby for the standardisation of contracts to increase trading volumes and liquidity Another important application for energy derivatives is as an access provider to lesser deregulated markets in Europe according to the official He explained that Germany and the UK are the most deregulated energy markets in Europe while other markets like the Benelux countries and Italy still lag behind The easiest way to enter and open up these countries is via derivatives which are unregulated EuroMPs Seek Reform Delay Financial Times November By Doug Cameron The European parliament is seeking a moratorium on sweeping reform of the global banking industry because of concern that US banks will gain a competitive advantage The Bank of International Settlements BIS the industrys de facto regulator is due to publish a consultation paper in January on updating the Basle Accord which governs how banks manage risks on their balance sheets The BIS plans to allow banks to use their internal systems for managing and monitoring risks replacing the current framework where central banks set minimum capital requirements to cover potential losses However while US banks may be able to implement the changes by the start of European rivals will have to wait as long as three years as legislation passes through the European Commission Council of Ministers and parliament Sarah Villers the European parliament member for London who leads its working group on the Basle reforms said that while the US introduced the rules in a matter of months the EU took twoandahalf years European banks undoubtedly suffered last time said Ms Villers A report passed last week by the parliament said the EU should also press for a moratorium on the implementation of the revised accord for an agreed period of time to allow Basle Committee members to adopt implementing legislation and enable the accord to enter into force on the same day in all countries However the industry appears to be resigned to implementation at different times and many view it as the price worth paying for the greater management flexibility that the internal ratings system will provide We have to live with the fact that the EU cannot go any faster said Jan Kalff the former chairman of ABN Amro who now heads work on Basle for the Institute of International Finance a trade body for the global banking industry There will be a competitive disadvantage for the EUbased banks unless we can force the US to slow down he said adding that this was unlikely The large US banks which are expected to benefit most from the revised accord are keen to push for its early implementation Officials involved in the Basle talks suggested that the BIS was unwilling as well as powerless to become involved in any possible confrontation with the US over the timetable However officials conceded that a twintrack timetable would contradict its intention of creating a level playing field in the way banks manage risk and are monitored by local regulatory authorities Ms Villiers agreed that the US was unlikely to accede to any request for delay and was pressing for fasttrack European legislation which would at best allow directives implementing the new accord to be passed in a minimum of around months End of ISDA Press Report for Wednesday November THE ISDA

Looms The Wall Street Journal Europe OTC Derivatives Market Grows Financial Times DC Bar Panelists Call for Tax Law Review In Wake of FASB Rule Change on Derivatives BNA Inc Ops Execs See Raised Profile Operations Management UK Association Sets Up Think Tank Operations Management Firms Alter Derivatives Use As Rule Change Looms The Wall Street Journal Europe November By Joe Niedzielski Some big US corporations are altering their use of derivatives in the runup to a new accounting rule that goes on the books next year according to a survey of senior financial executives released by Solutioncom LLC The basic findings of the survey of more than senior executives at Fortune companies confirm what some observers of the derivatives markets have been saying for several months Corporations will stick with simple or plain vanilla derivatives instruments because of the complexity and requirements of the new rule known as Financial Accounting Standard In its broadest form FAS requires corporations to report on their balance sheets the fair market value of their holdings of derivatives and that they be marked to market Corporations have publicly voiced their concerns in recent years that the standard may result in significant earnings volatility and hurt their share prices That concern remains among the top issues for those corporate executives surveyed by Solutioncom an Internetbased resource of information and tools that lets companies tackle the valuation accounting and reporting requirements of the new rule Solutioncom is a joint venture of PricewaterhouseCoopers and Gifford Fong Associates Hopefully all companies that produce USbased GAAP Generally Accepted Accounting Principles financial statements are evaluating their use of derivatives and hedges especially understanding the impact on earnings volatility that could occur as a result of FAS said Stan Friedman Solutioncoms chairman and chief executive officer The new standard has also been viewed by many observers as a spotlight into the riskmanagement profiles of US corporations Thats because the standard also requires corporations to describe their riskmanagement strategies and reasons for undertaking a particular hedge at its inception The correlation or effectiveness of the derivative with the hedged item must also be tested Solutioncom said the results of the survey reflect an increasing concern that these requirements expose a company to an unprecedented degree of outside scrutiny Not surprisingly those corporations surveyed ranked testing for hedge effectiveness documenting riskmanagement strategies and valuing derivatives as their three chief concerns with the new accounting standard though earnings volatility closely followed Some of the large companies that were dealing with are much more concerned about doing the hedge effectiveness test than anything else Mr Friedman said The survey also suggested that corporations will become more risk adverse and alter their selection of derivatives No longer able to defer gains or losses companies are being forced to review their derivative strategies and internal assessment of risk in more detail the Solutioncom report said Accounting requirements are top of mind as executives evaluate their positions and many companies are anticipating changes or adjustments in their earnings That has led to an increased focus on avoiding any speculative activity The more exotic the instrument the more likely the internal scrutiny on its merits the report said Of the of the corporations surveyed that used derivative many said they would avoid more customized or targeted derivatives and stay with the plain vanilla type until they fully understood the possibility of any earnings ramifications OTC Derivatives Market Grows Financial Times November The global overthecounter derivatives market grew by almost per cent in value during the first half of this year according to Swaps Monitor Publications a US research group SMP said the notional size of the global derivatives market grew to Dollars bn at the end of June an increase of per cent from Dollars bn in outstanding derivatives transactions at the end of Interestrate swaps increased by per cent in the first half of the year to a total notional value of Dollars bn from Dollars bn at the end of The swaps which involve the swapping of a fixedinterest rate payment for a floating rate one on debts of same maturity and value are increasingly being used by investors as a means of hedging fixedincome investments Interestrate options remained unchanged at Dollars bn while interestrate forwards grew to Dollars bn from Dollars bn The figures are compiled from databases of about global OTC derivatives dealers DC Bar Panelists Call for Tax Law Review In Wake of FASB Rule Change on Derivatives BNA Inc November The Democratic chief tax counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee said Nov he thought Congress should review the taxation of derivatives in view of changes to the accounting rules for reporting of gains and losses from derivatives John Buckley spoke at a program on derivatives presented by the DC Bar Section on Taxation Committee on Financial Instruments and Products Other speakers included Mark Price and Steve Rosenthal of KPMG and Chuck Wheeler of Alston Bird Price said Financial Accounting Standard No adopted in by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and amended in June DTR G requires separate accounting for derivatives using a marktomarket approach like that used under Internal Revenue Code Section The new rule requires that any change in the value of the derivative be bookedincluded as a gain or loss in determining the companys income for financial accounting purposeseven if the company has not disposed of the derivative The result Price said is to create increased volatility in the companys determination of income and loss for accounting purposes Wheeler said that companies do not want this increased volatility to apply to their determinations of income for tax purposes Price said the accounting profession adopted new standards for derivatives because of numerous problems including incomplete reporting in that some companies reported no information or reported information only in a footnote inconsistent reporting in that companies used different rules for determining cost and value difficulty in applying the accounting rules and lack of transparency in that companies took different approaches in their treatment of derivatives meaning income was not determined under the same rules and information on financial statements could not be compared with reliability Issues for Congress to Study Buckley said the marktomarket approach is slowly being adopted in the tax system He said it was not something he favored across the board but in his view it made sense for the tax system to apply the marktomarket approach to derivatives He said the problems identified by Price in accounting for derivatives also applied to the tax systemthere is uncertainty and inconsistency Buckley also said it would simplify recordkeeping to conform the tax system to the accounting approach and he favored Congress looking at this question He said that Congresss adoption of the marktomarket approach for securities in the early s was the right approach and he thought that the Financial Accounting Standards Board had taken an interesting and important step in adopting FAS Buckley said he sees the problem of defining a derivative as a major issue for the tax law and questioned whether the accounting definition was workable Other panelists said it is but Price noted that the definition is very factspecific and Wheeler said the rules are so new it is too early to tell whether companies will attempt to structure transactions to use the accounting definition Buckley said an additional issue would be whether gains and losses from derivatives should be treated as capital or ordinary under a marktomarket approach Hedge Accounting Reduces Volatility Wheeler said that some companies show reserves on their financial statements to account for potential losses in value but that this is not generally used for tax reporting Rosenthal said a current Tax Court case involves the Internal Revenue Service disputing a companys use of a credit adjustment to reduce income Price said the rules allow companies to elect to use hedge accounting He said a company which recognized gain or loss from a derivative identified as a hedge could have an offsetting gain or loss from the item being hedged Thus hedge accounting reduces the volatility created by FAS for companies that hedge their risk However FAS contains a strict definition for a hedge and an item could lose its character as a hedge because the definition is reapplied every quarter to the same item The panelists noted that for tax purposes once an item is considered a hedge its character would not change subsequently Price said the new FASB rule applies to entities that report to the Securities Exchange Commission and are effective for fiscal years beginning after June and Jan for companies reporting on a calendar year Ops Execs See Raised Profile Operations Management November Operations and technology executives are taking on a larger role within firms and ate receiving more senior job titles as a result according to a Russell Reynolds Associates study to be released this week The head of operations is no longer just a senior vp but is now at the partner level said George Wilbanks partner with Russell Reynolds The shift has been prompted by a number of factors including the blurring of lines between banks insurers mutual fund firms and other financial services companies and the growing importance of multiple channels and the subsequent complexity of operations and information Firms need much more robust technology and operations platforms to handle the added complexity Wilbanks said The study Recruiting Trends in Investment Management also found an increase in the number of searches in operations because many firms do not have someone in place who can take on a more executive role UK Association Sets Up Think Tank Operations Management November The Computing Services and Software Association the UK trade association for the IT services and software sector is establishing a think tank to investigate applied technology in the financial and business sectors The idea originated with members who were noticing the proliferation of technology initiatives and wanted ways to navigate them said Andrew Muir director of global securities solutions for Mercator and chair of the banking and finance group for CSSA With so many software initiatives it is difficult for the industry to know how to direct research and development to apply the evolving technology explained Muir For example SWIFTs SWIFTNet the new Internet Protocol based network will impact on initiatives such as Continuous Linked Settlement and the Global Straight Through Processing Association Muir said The bimonthly meetings will begin Dec in London and then white papers will be issued to promote thought and provide direction to the industry Muir noted Muir will head up the soontobenamed think tank and will be joined by Anthony Kirby the axexecutive director of the GSTPA who is now heading up a team responsible for BB at Boleronet and John Wilson a director with Londonbased consultancy CityIQ There will also be senior representatives from the leading securities firms including Deutsche Bank and UBS Warburg and other vendors an industry official noted Calls to Wilson and Kirby were not returned End of

Times Singapore Derivatives Platform May Give CBA Edge Over Locals Australian Financial Review Kloffe Launches KLSE CI Options Contract Business Times Malaysia CFTC Rules Could Change Futures Industry How Is The Question Bridge News Web BondTrade Systems Draw Regulators Scrutiny The Wall Street Journal New MAS Guidelines On Credit Derivatives Business Times Singapore December By Ling Su Ann The Monetary Authority of Singapore yesterday issued new guidelines on the capital treatment of credit derivatives to deal with the problem of excessive capital charge for a debt asset Credit derivatives first used in the United States in are used by banks to reduce their risk exposure to certain credits or loans In a typical creditlinked note transaction the protection seller Bank A assumes the credit risk from the protection buyer Bank B in return for a stream of regular interest payments Bank B will then assume the default risk for a preselected asset and Bank A will acquire the credit exposure to both the reference asset in this case the notes and Bank B Under Section of MAS notice the seller is required to sum up the riskweighted exposures to both the notes and Bank B A capital charge of per cent is then applied to the aggregate credit exposure resulting in a uniform per cent capital charge for protection selling banks This would clearly be excessive says the MAS especially when the reference assets are of very high credit quality In June last year the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision proposed a more risksensitive standardised approach Pending the finalisation of this new framework protection selling banks should not be unduly penalised MAS said To address this concern protection sellers will now be allowed to apply the higher of the risk charges appropriate to the reference asset or protection buyer subject to the condition that both are rated as being investment grade or higher BBBand above Should the credit rating of either fall below investment grade a dual capital charge must be applied to both these credit exposures Where the reference asset or protection buyer is not rated the MAS may waive the dual charge rule on a casebycase basis However it must be shown that the risk faced by the seller is adequately addressed by a single capital charge The rule wont impact Singapore banks right now because they dont enter into a high amount of credit derivatives But it will make things more transparent by telling banks how to treat the notes on their balance sheets said Joe Toh credit analyst at UOB Asia Derivatives Platform May Give CBA Edge Over Locals Australian Financial Review December By George Lekakis Commonwealth Bank of Australia is hoping that a new inhouse derivatives risk management platform will lead to a reduction of regulatory capital it is required to hold on its balance sheet The new risk simulation system known as CSPARQ was launched in July and is being used to scope credit and market risk in CBAs institutional banking arm Mr Ellis Bugg a senior risk executive said the system would be extended to the foreign exchange operations in the next six months He said the platform would give CBA a competitive edge over other local investment banks in evaluating current and future trading exposures Mr Bugg said the Reserve Bank was aware of the advantages of the inhouse system but was not yet prepared to allow any variation in the banks Tier One capital requirements Up until now most risk analysis systems have simply analysed present positions and risk exposures he said This system is forward looking allowing us to project exposures in the future over the entire life of a fiveyear contract for instance The bank is also considering setting up a special unit that would take on risk management business from corporate clients and less efficient financial institutions The head of technology in the institutional bank Mr Bob Stribling said CBA was among a handful of banks that had the capability of running near realtime credit simulation on a global basis We think we have something quite special that could be used outside the group A string of derivatives driven disasters in global banks since the mids has prompted crossborder regulators led by the Bank of International Settlements to clamp down on the measurement and reporting of derivative risk in banking CBA embarked on a complete overhaul of its risk management system in its investment bank in November and launched the new platform in July At the height of the Asian economic crisis in shortcomings in the risk management systems of institutions such as ANZ and Caspian Securities were highlighted with the companies reporting big losses from derivatives related activities in emerging markets Since then local regulators have paid more attention to the risk management tools and disclosure of the big four Australian banks National CBA Westpac and ANZ on their derivatives based exposures Mr Bugg said no other bank in Australia had developed such risk management capabilities CBA was aware of only three North American banks that were using similar methodologies Kloffe Launches KLSE CI Options Contract Business Times Malaysia December By Debra Moreira The Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange Bhd Kloffe today launches its second product the KLSE CI Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index options contract The move is part of the plan to increase the number of products and enhance liquidity in the market Kloffe is hoping the product will attract local and foreign institutional support which will subsequently assist towards building and attracting liquidity Kloffe a whollyowned subsidiary of the KLSE is the first derivatives exchange in Malaysia Executive chairman Ramli Ibrahim has said that the new product is a step in he right direction to woo foreign investors back in the country citing as one of the reasons investors were staying out was due to a lack of choice in products Kloffe will also be introducing an additional two products by the first quarter of placing high importance on futures products based on Islamic index It the options contract is a good step forward in developing an interest and hopefully bring back the foreign investors It is a step in the right direction Ramli said Although a huge initial demand for the product is not expected Kloffe expects the product to grow gradually as people get used to it Kloffe recognises that it is critical for all market participants to be properly educated to ensure that they have sufficient understanding of the use of derivatives products and are fully equipped to manage their investment portfolios said Ramli As such Kloffe is currently undertaking a comprehensive marketing and educational programme for the KLSE CI Options launch and to promote the existing product An option provides the holderbuyer the right without the obligation to purchase call or sell put a quantity of a specific underlying instrument at a stipulated price within a specific period of time To acquire this right the holderbuyer pays a minimal price known as the option premium to the seller also called the writer of the option A futures contract however is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell the underlying instrument at a specific time in the future for a specific price determined today CFTC Rules Could Change Futures Industry How Is The Question Bridge News November By Mary Haffenberg After months of anticipation new regulatory rules were released last week that pave the way for changes in how exchanges list derivatives contracts The proposals also open the door for new electronic trading platforms and clearing organizations to jump into the derivatives listing and clearing business But how these rules will be interpreted without making them into law is leaving some industry players wary The Commodity Futures Trading Commission the regulator of US derivatives markets last week approved rules first proposed in February that create a new regulatory framework for futures markets The rules which go into effect days after they first appear in the Federal Register create three regulatory tiers under which various futures contracts and swaps products in established markets will fall The idea is that the three tiers will match the degree of regulation to the varying nature of the products and the customers trading in the markets Under the new rules the three regulatory tiers are recognized futures exchanges derivatives transactions facilities and exempt multilateral transaction execution facilities Products within the RFE category for example will allow for retail participation and those contracts will have the most customer protection and regulatory safeguards attached to them A bill that passed the House of Representatives in October but is stalled in the Senate would make into law most of these CFTC rule changes The bill also would legalize single stock futures provide legal certainty to overthecounter markets take the CFTC rule changes even farther in some areas and make other changes not within the power of the CFTC If the bill the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of does overcome significant obstacles in the Senate and pass when Congress returns next month to finish up its work the bill would supercede any CFTC rules Because the CFTC rules dont go into effect until at least the end of January or the beginning of February as of Wednesday they still had not been listed on the Federal Register lawyers and others reading the rules have been in no hurry to digest and interpret them In addition a lot could change if lawmakers pass the futures modernization act WIDESPREAD PRAISE FOR RULE CHANGES To be sure the rule changes that have been spurred on by CFTC Chairman William Rainer have received widespread praise Market participants and established exchanges like the idea that in the less regulated markets costs to do business are expected to decrease Also less regulation could lead to more flexibility in listing and trading contracts and more experimentation in the futures markets which in recent years have been sorely lagging when compared with the growth of cash and securities markets There also is a doubleedged sword of changes The rules make it significantly easier for a new electronic trading platform similar to electronic communications networks popular in the equities markets to come in and list futures contracts taking on the established futures exchanges that for decades have had a virtual contractlisting monopoly The rules also allow for the first time nonCFTC regulated organizations to clear exempt MTEF and bilateral contracts However these clearing groups still must be regulated under banking laws foreign regulators or the Securities and Exchange Commission Established clearing organizations and futures exchanges already are expressing concern that these new expected competitors will be able to become more nimble because they should be able to operate under less regulation The established exchanges and clearing organizations are expected to fall under the most regulated CFTC tier of regulations if they are to continue to serve retail customers If were a provider of a broad series of markets its unclear as to the net savings said Dennis Dutterer interim president and CEO of the Chicago Board of Trade By some estimates more than of futures market participants are institutional or commercial customers With that figure in mind ECNs could come in and list contracts under the DTF category That would prohibit retail customer participation unless the ECN got special CFTC approval that would allow retail trading through futures commission merchants that have at least million in adjusted net capital The exchanges which to date have had at least some retail participation in most of their contracts would have to continue under RFE rules Some industry watchers suggested that some exchanges to combat ECN competition yet retain retail customers could list two contracts For example the New York Board of Trade could have an RFE sugar pit and an allelectronic DTF sugar pit NYBOT President and CEO Mark Fichtel said his exchange was expected to request that its sugar and cocoa contracts fall under the DTF category Im not saying this will happen but based on what theyre talking about they have to be careful about compartmentalizing the markets said Joseph Murphy CEO of Refco Global Futures one of the countrys largest FCMs A probable solution would be to put it on the backs of FCMs We could become market makers to give access to our retail customers like the FX markets referring to the cash foreign exchange markets in which the interbank markets commonly take the other side of a customer trade instead of routing it to outside customers Others question whether that is the course of the futures markets as a result of the rule changes and whether it is good for the markets to have peripheral markets proliferating However its still too early to determine how the traditional exchanges will list their contracts under these new rules Although no one is suggesting that the exchanges will close their doors to easy access for retail customers allowing them in their markets may not be cheap I would hope that the CFTC would continue the concept of trying to ensure that our markets are competitive with competing markets when the exchanges are looking for flexibility to respond to competitive possibilities Dutterer said SWAP MARKETS CONTINUE WITH EXEMPTIONS For their part participants in swaps are basically happy with what the CFTC has done within their limited powers with the exempt MTEF rules For example new entities such as insurance companies can participate in the swaps markets These markets will continue to operate under an exemption of the commodities act and will continue on without legal certainty but a spokeswoman for the International Swaps and Derivatives Association said the rule changes were an improvement over current conditions However the ISDA is unhappy that only financial products can be included in the exempt MTEF category The CFTC said metals and energy contracts cannot qualify for exempt MTEF the least regulated tier because the markets are not sufficiently deep and liquid and there are concerns related to the exhaustibility of supply and market manipulation As a result multilateral electronic executing trading facilities will fall under the DTF category which has led to concerns that the regulations may stymie innovation in these markets Once the rules do come into play and assuming Congress does not codify them there is still another underlying concern Because the CFTC rules are not law some in the industry worry how they will be interpreted in the upcoming years and under different CFTC heads After all the regulator has had its share of leaders with vastly different philosophies from each other Web BondTrade Systems Draw Regulators Scrutiny The Wall Street Journal December By Randall Smith and Gregory Zuckerman Antitrust regulators launched an investigation of online bondtrading and foreignexchange systems owned by several of Wall Streets biggest securities firms to examine whether the trading platforms are used to limit competition Several top securities firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc Merrill Lynch Co Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup Inc have received requests for information as part of the investigation which is being conducted by the antitrust division of the US Department of Justice The firms either had no comment or said they are cooperating A Justice Department spokesman said the agency is looking at the competitive effects of certain joint ventures in the online bondtrading industry and in online foreign exchange The inquiry was reported Thursday by the Bond Buyer newspaper and the Web site of Industry Standard a magazine that covers Internet economic issues Ralph C Ferrara a lawyer specializing in securities regulation at the New York law firm of Debevoise Plimpton said the probe raises an interesting issue because a commonly owned utility that boosts price transparency for the entire market but simultaneously gives firms a look at each others market strategies is something that is a Jekyll and a Hyde The requests for information known as civil investigative demands involve the recent formation of several online bond and foreignexchange portals by Wall Streets biggest firms in various combinations people familiar with the matter say I think their interest is because the largest firms are involved together said John Ladensack bond chief for the Schwab Capital Markets unit of San Francisco discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp Schwab which is forming its own bondtrading portal has avoided participation in some online marketplaces because of the dominance of the big players Mr Ladensack said The probe isnt the only Justice Department investigation into the inner workings of Wall Street Another pending inquiry disclosed in early is focusing on the prevalence of a underwriting fee for initial public offerings of less than million in size Federal regulators have looked at the antitrust implications of a wide range of other Internet marketplaces from cars to real estate to airline tickets The American Society of Travel Agents for example asked the Justice Department to investigate an online service owned by several airlines saying it would drive travel agents out of business The Federal Trade Commission has approved a carparts Web site set up by the Big Three auto makers Electronic bond trading is growing but has yet to catch on Such activity represents just to of overall bond trading according to Tower Group a technologyresearch firm up from about last year Its worth investigating the area There are questions about how these markets will turn electronic and whether these dealers will control the market place says Larry Tabb group director at Tower Group The concern is that they see each others bids and can artificially manipulate prices and that they will create an electronic market thats not open to all participants but so far it looks like theyre letting others in Two of the bestknown upstart onlinebond systems sponsored by leading Wall Street firms that deal with corporate bonds are BondBook LLC and Market Axess LLC Another of the big online trading firms is TradeWeb LLC owned by a group including Goldman Sachs Lehman Brothers Group Holdings Inc and the Credit Suisse First Boston unit of Credit Suisse Group TradeWebs trading volume represents between and of all dealertocustomer transactions in the US Treasury market up from a year ago according to Tower Group although TradeWeb officials say the figure is higher With TradeWebs online system investors can contact as many as five dealers at a time and send them orders to buy or sell Treasurys or governmentagency securities Investors also can compare prices from the five firms The dealers cant see bond quotes from their rivals according to Tom Eady chief operating officer at TradeWeb Mr Eady says the firm hasnt been contacted by the Department of Justice securities executives said the Justice probe doesnt appear to encompass Treasury bonds End of ISDA Press Report for Friday December

debt swap over SEC rule fears Financial Times OTHER Newer options Business Standard Basle II Financial Times June The process of refining the Basle capital adequacy rules is drawing to a close A revised set of rules will be agreed by the end of this year to take effect in There remains broad agreement that it is about time to update the original formula for calculating how much capital a bank needs Yet there is enough disagreement on the philosophy and details of the new proposals to suggest that their implementation will be difficult and expensive Perhaps this will prove to be the spur the banking industry needed to start spending on information technology once again The old rules are straightforward enough Minimum capital requirements are set as a percentage of each banks assets with some broad categories of loan such as mortgages or government debt assigned reduced weightings The new rules are a considerable improvement in this area tying capital requirements much more closely to the actual risk posed by individual loans Oddly though exceptional treatment is preserved for German real estate loans But if the measurement of credit risk becomes more sophisticated the addition of other worse defined categories of risk notably operational risk restores much of the crudeness of the original agreement It would be worth taking more time to reach agreement on the right way of measuring operational risk But political realities notably the length of time needed to get an updated European capital adequacy directive to incorporate the new rules mean that this is unlikely to happen The result is that Basle II will prove to have a much shorter shelf life than Basle I Australias APRA says Basel home loan rules unfair Reuters June By Marion Rae SYDNEY June Reuters Australias bank regulator said on Monday it believed proposed reforms to global capital adequacy requirements by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision could introduce competitive inequalities in the Australian market In particular proposals for capital backing for the residential mortgage market a dominant and low risk area of business for Australian institutions needed to be modified the Australian Prudential Regulation Authoritys APRA general manager of risk analysis Wayne Byers told Reuters The Basel committee has proposed that exposures secured by residential property attract a percent risk weighting the same as the current weight but large institutions able to follow new internal ratingsbased guidelines would be able to reflect the very low housing loss experience in Australia with a cheaper risk weighting of five to percent Within the proposed accord there are three methods by which banks can calculate capital charges for credit risk a standard method which is a variant on the current method and a further two methods one simple and one advanced where banks use their own internal ratings systems as a means of allocating capital Overall the more advanced the method you use there are some quite significant capital savings Byers said The more sophisticated methods arent restricted to big banks but obviously they have the knowledge the resources and the data and that means that theyre more likely to pursue them As a percentage of total assets as at March APRA said housing loans amounted to an average of percent for Australias major banks including National Australia Bank Ltd Commonwealth Bank of Australia Westpac Banking Corp and the ANZ Banking Group Ltd and percent for regional banks BIG BANKS STAND TO GAIN Given that the minimum requirement is an eight percent capital ratio banks have to have A which is percent for every A of housing loans they make he said It would stay the same for those banks that stay on the simplest method but for those banks which move on to methods where they use their own internal measures of risk a much lower number is produced he said Theyre based on an international average but Australian data shows it up to be a much lower risk activity he said APRA has proposed lowering the standardised housing risk weighting to percent or allowing individual countries to allow a weighting lower than Basel requirements where historical loss rates and market characteristics made this appropriate I dont think the committee envisaged the big gaps that have turned out so I would expect they would certainly look to reduce those gaps between the different methods Im less sure that they will deal with productlevel issues Byers said Housing loans in Australia are a very low risk activity theyre not necessarily that in other markets where housing prices are volatile and where banks dont necessarily use conservative LVR loantovalue rates he said Capital adequacy rules in Australia required LVRs of less than percent unless backed by mortgage insurance It may be that we have to do something ourselves to tackle that issue The final proposals will be out at the end of the year and were waiting to see how they look before we commit ourselves to any action Byers said Asia May Not Be Ready For New Basel Pact Ctrl Bankers Dow Jones International News June SINGAPORE APAsian central bankers Saturday

submitting views on the accord dubbed Basel which is designed to set the benchmark for bank operations and risk management By replacing the original Basel Accords the new agreement aims to promote better allocation of the money banks must put aside for bad loans through the use of more scrupulous risk analysis On Friday reaction to the new pact was made public on the Web site of the Bank for International Settlements The Basel Switzerland organization which promotes cooperation among central banks authored the accord Big banks called the plan too conservative while smaller institutions said it will increase their cost of capital and warned it could deepen the divide between rich and poor nations Most felt the regulations were onerously complex and that the planned launch date was too ambitious The Institute of International Finance a private association of the worlds biggest banks based in Washington weighed in Friday with perhaps the most influential assessment The proposal includes at every step of the creditassessment process an element of conservatism said Jan Kalff chairman of the IIF steering committee on Basel and former chairman of ABN Amro Bank who was on a visit to Hong Kong While the riskanalysis procedures mandated by Basel might lower the amount of money some banks need to set aside for bad loans those savings would be offset by added costs the IIF said The hiring and training of new staff new software and a general slowing down of the lending process would generate those costs Some bankers have mentioned to me that the costs are going to be of the same magnitude as YK implementations But YK was only oneoff this will be a year after year costly thing said Mr Kalff The IIF report estimated a total cost to banks of trillion over five years Mr Kalff added that such costs wouldnt be incurred by nonbanking financial institutions giving them a competitive advantage against traditional banks Asian central bankers Saturday said their countries may not be ready for the BIS accord In particular infrastructure and internal capacities in some member countries could limit their ability to fully implement the accord by then the Governors of the Southeast Asian Central Banks said after a twoday meeting in Singapore Meanwhile smaller banks especially those in the developing world had other concerns over the Basel draft The proposed approach will result in fostering or even deepening the division into highly developed and underdeveloped countries both with respect to external funding and capital costs wrote Leszek Balcerowicz of the Polish Commission for Bank supervision The problem for emergingmarket banks is that their client base typically has lower credit ratings than those of major banks do As such under the new rules these banks will have set aside a greater portion of their capital to cover possible losses If they dont they will be punished by higher costs when they borrow money in international capital markets And borrowers especially smaller and less creditworthy ones will likely pay the price with higher capital costs Again lessdeveloped nations are likely to suffer most since higher capital costs could slow development of higherrisk small and midsize enterprises One complaint shared by big and small banks was Basel s insistence that banks be more widely reviewed by creditrating agencies to determine asset risk In addition to expressing concerns over the added costs of this policy some felt it would be counterproductive The increasing reliance on external rating agencies would undermine the initiatives of banks in enhancing their riskmanagement policies and practices and internal control said the Reserve Bank of India There was also a general call for more physical collateral such as property and accounts receivable to be factored into banks credit risks There is ample evidence to show that such collateral is effective in mitigating risk said Mr Kalff of the IIF In light of such wideranging concerns many felt that it would be difficult to meet Basel s scheduled launch date The IIF felt that parts of the accord would require at least to months of further negotiations even though the BIS has been hoping to finalize the accord by the end of this year Developing nations suggested that the accord be phased in over a longer period of time In the words of Adrian Byrne of the Central Bank of Ireland This time frame is still too short given the range of information not available Derivatives industry IFR June Derivatives industry officials are optimistic that some of their criticisms of the draft of the new Basle II Capital Accord will be taken on board by regulators They believe there is a good chance that their input on the calibration of the internal ratingsbased function will result in a change in the accord for example However there is no sign yet that their input on the W factor charge on credit derivatives will result in a revision The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision will next month release exposure drafts on operational risk and the internal ratings based approach for treatment of equities retail portfolios project finance and securitisation as areas for additional consultation and interim papers for its new global capital adequacy rule proposals dubbed Basle II These were all green areas when the consultation came out in January said a Bank for international Settlements official It still remains unclear whether the W factor will be eliminated he noted There are some strong proponents for it on the committee So it depends on the nature of the comment letters he said William McDonough the chairman of the Basle Committee is widely viewed as having backed away from the keeping the W charge in the new accord but Oliver Page the head of regulatory policy at the UK Financial Services Authority and a member of the committee is believed to remain a proponent Page said that he is keeping an open mind about the issue however This is a genuine consultation process we have got to weigh up the contributions he said last Friday the day after the deadline for comments on the new accord passed The W charge is a levy on credit derivatives when they are used for credit risk mitigation by banks which contrasts with the zero weighting given to guarantees The BISs strategy of weeding out measures that require more attention is aimed at enabling the regulator to push ahead with certain issues and finish formulating its positions on others while keeping to its deadline for implementing the new rules the BIS official said The last thing that they want to do is push ahead with everything and then reopen structural issues said Simon Gleeson a partner at Allen Overy in London On the flip side keeping everything on hold would make it impossible for it to work within its deadline he added As far as the European Union is concerned the problem that they face is the timing It took seven years to get the last Basle Accord through and into directive form The idea that the EUs implementation will get finished by is absurd a derivatives industry consultant in London said The challenge is exacerbated by the fact that when the EU writes directives they apply to all financial institutions not just internationally active banks This means that in addition to implementing the new rules it will have to draw lines between institutions and decide how to ensure that the system does not put small and mediumsized institutions at a disadvantage The Fed wants to start enforcing new rules as soon as possible If they do we will get a situation in which we have two completely different capital adequacy systems the consultant added The start of was set as a compromise due date between the US Federal Reserve and the UKs Financial Services Authority for enforcing the new rules Basle IIs initial industry comment period closed last Thursday The International Swaps and Derivatives Association focused its criticisms on three areas It argued that the introduction of rigid capital floors would increase costs that the proposed operational risk and W factor charges are arbitrary and that the proposed calibration of the internal ratings based function does not reflect market practice The accord takes significant steps toward defining an approach to setting banks capital requirements which is risksensitive granular and flexible yet there are several areas that are inconsistent with the overall goals of the accord and existing bank best practices said Emmanuelle Sebton head of risk management for ISDA ISDA officials are due to meet the FSAs Page and other members of the capital group within the Basle Committee in New York in mid July at which stage ISDA will press the case for abandonment of the W factor charge on use of credit derivatives Convertible default swap proposal near IFR June An informal working group within the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations credit derivatives market practice group is nearing the completion of a preliminary proposal aimed at creating standardised documentation for swaps based on convertible bonds and zero coupon convertible issues The surge in convertible and zero coupon convertible issuance this year and the trend towards stripping the equity and credit components out of large issues are heightening the need for the documentation Right now there isnt a standard Thats the problem Each firm uses different language Resolving this will enhance liquidity in an already wellfunctioning market said Derek Smith head of credit derivatives trading at Goldman Sachs in New York Credit derivatives market participants would benefit from standardisation as it would improve liquidity If you strip a convertible with one dealer and want to unwind with another dealer you might come across dealers that dont like the documentation So they are unlikely to bid and you are forced to go back to the first dealer said John Tierney head of credit derivatives research at Deutsche Bank in New York Even though only a portion of investment grade convertibles are stripped and stripping typically covers between a third and a quarter of a stripped convertible the activity still generates vast amounts of credit default swaps business On a USbn issue for instance in excess of USm can be stripped which is time consuming to offset given that credit default swaps usually trade in USm blocks Standard documentation is also needed because stripping often causes a jump in the price of the issuers single name credit default swap Its more technical than controversial Creating documentation that works is the challenge said Smith Before the groups proposal is available for general use it will need to be approved by ISDAs documentation committee and vetted by the industry Credit Derivatives Market To Hash Out Successor Issues Dow Jones June By Joe Niedzielski NEW YORK Dow Jones Credit derivatives professionals are working on a solution to the vexing question of how these contracts should be treated when companies spin off units or restructure into separate entities These demerger or successor issues are expected to take some months to resolve and the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations new subcommittee of the credit derivatives market practice group has given the question priority among a host of other longterm issues Adding some momentum to the discussions is the pending restructuring of ATT Corp T ATT is among the more activelytraded credits in the single name credit default swap market These overthecounter derivatives contracts let buyers transfer the default risk on loans or bonds by selling it to a third party for a premium thats derived from the notional amount of the contract ATTs plan first unveiled last fall would split the company into a business and consumer longdistance unit as well as broadband and wireless units ATT is expected to go ahead with the plan in the coming months People seem motivated about resolving this said one credit derivatives official in New York As ATT gets closer I would imagine that would galvanize people further on this side of the Atlantic When companies split up spin off units or demerge the successor entities are allocated different portions of the previous entities outstanding debt obligations and publiclyissued bonds ISDAs document governing credit derivatives essentially calls for the default swap to follow the entity that takes on the majority of the obligations in a merger consolidation or transfer This all or substantially all clause in the documentation though can be interpreted differently in other legal jurisdictions And that could pose a problem if a market participant has contracts on a particular credit with US and English counterparties Still Fallout From National Power A number of market participants are attempting to negotiate a resolution to default swaps written on the UKs National Power PLC which demerged late last year In the split Innogy Holdings PLC IOG received the former companys UKbased power and generating assets National Power changed its name to International Power PLC IPR and took the international power assets Innogy Holdings was also allocated with about of the former companys debt obligations and about of its public bonds International Power kept about of the former companys debt obligations and about of its public bonds The credit derivatives official in New York said there are theoretical ways of hashing out the successor issue One possible approach would be to have multiname default swaps after a demerger for participants that held contracts on the single name corporate prior to the demerger Essentially the trade would be split into a series of trades on the demerged entities though it would likely be difficult to calculate the relevant notional amounts that should be allocated among those new default swaps this person said Two banks pull out of Argentina debt swap over SEC rule fears Financial Times Jun By Thomas Catan Two investment banks unexpectedly pulled out of managing Argentinas record debt exchange yesterday because of worries they may have violated US securities regulations placing at risk millions of dollars in fees On the advice of their lawyers Deutsche Bank and ABNAmro yesterday withdrew from a group of banks chosen by the Argentine government to manage the multibillion dollar transaction It is understood that Banco de Galicia an Argentine bank will also exclude itself from offering the bonds in the US People close to the banks said company lawyers had become concerned that some pieces of research in the runup to the transaction may have breached US securities regulations A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington would neither confirm nor deny it had warned investment banks In an effort to buy time to restart its struggling economy Argentina hopes to exchange bonds coming due before for longerdated paper The government stopped taking offers from bondholders yesterday and is due to announce the results of the massive operation on Monday Market analysts expect the government will succeed in swapping around Dollars bn by far the largest transaction of its type If that is the case the group of investment banks would earn Dollars m which is considered to be a juicy fee for relatively light work However concerns that the Chinese wall between analysts and sales people had been breached may have cost several banks their share of the fees Some bankers suggested it was not the SEC that had raised the initial objection but rather investment banks threatening each other to maximise their proportion of the fees According to an Argentine official the problem first came to light on Thursday after questions were raised about a research report by Deutsche Banks emerging markets analysts California Clash Over PowerGrid Control The Wall Street Journal May By Rebecca Smith As California politicians wade deeper into the energy crisis the states electricgrid operator appears headed toward a showdown with federal energy regulators over whether its board is independent enough The California Independent System Operator Friday bowed to pressure from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and submitted its qualifications to continue as a federally sanctioned grid operator But the tardy filing is almost certain to be challenged by federal regulators and market participants because the ISOs governance structure has strayed from a bedrock requirement that it be independent of control by any market participant The market participant casting the long shadow is the state of California Since January when the state of California began buying huge sums of electricity on behalf of its nearly broke utilities the ISO has been under pressure to give state officials preferential treatment and unique access to marketsensitive information Its chief operations officer paid a year according to the most recent IRS filing is on indefinite loan to the governors office where he is working as an energy adviser This politicization of the ISO is significant because the organizations purpose is to run a market for power needed to keep the electric system in balance and to give buyers and sellers impartial access to the power lines on which they depend to move electricity Unlike other commodities electricity cant be stored Transactions therefore depend completely on instantaneous access to the electric superhighway of highvoltage lines The FERC worries that a loss of political independence by the ISO will further degrade the states already dysfunctional energy market The FERC hasnt formally accused the ISO of acting improperly but it is clear that a wall between the state and the ISO that once was solid has become permeable Last month the ISO notified the FERC that the state of California had asserted it must have access to the ISO control room floor and nonpublic information as a necessary condition of continuing to buy power even though such preferential access violates ISO rules But without the state to back power purchases it has spent nearly billion on electricity since January the ISOs market would collapse and blackouts and chaos likely would ensue The governance issue which may appear esoteric actually cuts to the heart of the power crisis in California State officials feel they have ceded too much control to the FERC which they accuse of shirking its duty to protect consumers As a consequence the state has forced its way into the inner workings of the formerly arcane ISO a publicbenefit corporation formed three years ago amid Californias push to deregulate its electricity market In January the state legislature authorized the governor to eject a FERCapproved board of directors and hand pick his own fivemember ISO board The state attorney general ordered old board members to resign or face personal fines of Currently one ISO board member is a former member of the governors staff while another on the governors behalf negotiated the proposed purchase of utility transmission assets by the state all the while serving as chairman of the supposedly independent board The ISOs chairman says changes in the board structure have made the ISO more answerable to the citizenry and efficient Michael Kahn who is a San Francisco attorney added that the governance structure had to change to reflect the fact that were in a state of emergency In its filing Friday the ISO took the position that the tighter relationship between the ISOs board and the state doesnt violate the FERCs requirement that ISO boards be free of control by market participants Even though the state has been required to provide financial support the ISO asserts this participation does not make the State a market participant Many market watchers scoff at that contention Inevitably this will lead to a showdown said N Beth Emery former general counsel of the ISO and now an energy attorney for Ballard Spahr Andrews Ingersoll in Washington DC Clearly the ISO is in violation of the independence requirement But the FERC doesnt have many tools for enforcing its vision of autonomy That may explain why it has failed to intervene It can order the ISO to make board changes for instance But if it refuses there may not be much the FERC can do except threaten to rescind the ISOs operating tariffs That of course is the opposite of what the FERC wants to do which is encourage creation of multistate grid organizations free of any political favoritism But Californias angry isolationism appears to be growing Gov Gray Davis said the ISOs filing ensured the state will maintain control of our own energy destiny and not be subject to the whims of federal regulators or the interests of other states To date the FERC has been steadfast in its resolve to make regional grid operators independent organizations free of control of utilities and power marketers It has rejected other gridoperator proposals because it felt utilities that owned the power lines were attempting to retain too much control But Order the landmark decision issued in December that promoted the creation of independent grid runners throughout the nation never contemplated a state government assuming such a huge role in a market as has occurred in California If anything that role is likely to increase Not only is the state of California the biggest power buyer in the nation now but it has formed a power authority that intends to build and operate generating plants In addition Mr Davis is promoting a plan to buy the transmission systems of the states investorowned utilities As such a new vertically integrated utility is forming that could be larger than any the nation has seen since the power trusts of the s were broken apart by Congress It is rife with conflicts of interest The ISOs drift has created a fissure in the solid support it enjoyed from the states big utilities that transferred control of their transmission systems to the ISO in PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co unit which is in bankruptcy proceedings declined to join the ISO filing which was supported by Edison Internationals Southern California Edison unit and Sempra Energys San Diego Gas Electric Co unit PGE said in a separate gridplan filing that it would prefer the ISO join a multistate grid organization It expressed reservations about the independence of the current board Opposition to the states influence is becoming more vocal The Electric Power Supply Association a trade group representing power producers warned FERC last month that the ISO has become a partisan advocate for the State of California and sought FERC intervention to defend the rights of all market interests Newer options Business Standard June By Gaurav Dua In addition to the numerous advantages of derivatives in terms of risk management price discovery and instruments for providing the required leverage to the investor options are also very effectively used as a tool to develop and structure innovative products Investment bankers use various form of options including call put exotic binary and so on to structure products for retail investors Such products have gained immense popularity in developed markets like the US and Europe In fact structured products offered by investment banks like Salomon Smith Barney SSB Goldman Sachs and others are also actively traded at the Chicago Board Options Exchange CBOE These relatively new investment vehicles are similar to call or put options as they have an expiration date and are cash settled like index options The capital markets division at CBOE assesses the concept behind the instrument and provides regulatory guidance before the product is offered in the market One of the very successful and popular examples of structured products is capital protected notes where the return on investment is linked to the performance of certain indices basket of stocks or a single stock in a given time frame Here the investment bank or intermediaries will calculate the present value of riskfree interest that can be earned on the capital and use it to buy call options The best part of the instrument is that there is no risk of capital loss And the risk of the investor is only limited to the interest that could have been earned on the capital This apart exotic options like knockin or knockout options where the expiry of the option is based on certain conditions are utilised to provide flexibility and additional features to the investors For instance structured products such as Target Trust Warrants offered by SSB guarantees an assured return of six per cent with no risk to the capital and investor can opt for redemption before the expiry date But there is a cap on the maximum amount of return that can be earned on the deposit A typical example of index based structured product is Equity based notes by SSB where the returns to the investor is based on the appreciation in Dow Jones Industrial Average in a given time frame This product is actively traded on CBOE In the Indian context structured products could very well fill in the gap between the high risk high return equity investments and low risk low return fixed deposits by banks The drop of basis in the interest rate on popular investment avenues such as public provident fund national saving certificate and others has already compelled the small investors to look at others investment alternatives for higher returns In such a scenario structured products are expected to do well in India Structured products could turn out to be a boon for numerous software professionals who were unable to cashin on their employee stock option ESOP in the bullrun due to the lockin period Investments bankers could target such professionals with customised structured products using put options says Sanjiv Mehta chief executive officer derivative segment

US Equity Derivatives FOW ISDA tackles default swap successor definition IFR May The International Swaps and Derivatives Associations credit derivatives market practice committee last week moved to tackle the question of reference entity for credit default swaps in the event of a demerger With the dismantling of ATT looming the need to resolve the successor issue is heightened say industry officials who note that resolution would enhance legal certainty for the product ATTs restructuring plan calls for splitting the company into four different units and assigning the bulk of the firms massive debt burden to two of the entities Under the ISDA credit derivatives definitions the entity that assumes all or substantially all of a firms debt responsibility after a breakup should be used as the reference entity for outstanding credit default swap contracts The ATT example highlights the need for clarification because no one entity stands to assume the majority of the companys debt obligations Also ATT is one of the most heavily traded names in the credit default swap market One potential answer may be to allocate a demerging companys default protection among the newly formed companies according to the percentage of debt that each entity is allocated said credit derivatives officials in New York No historical guidance exists currently The issue first rose to prominence last year with the question of the reference entity for credit default swaps on the UKs National Power following the companys demerger International Power was eventually agreed to be the reference entity because it had to take on new debt at the time of the demerger Many end users of default swaps were unhappy with the way major dealers spun out the debate over this case however Firms representing the key participants in the credit derivatives market on June will report back to the credit derivatives market practice committee The firms consulting the marketplace include a credit derivatives dealing firm a bank portfolio manager and an end user of credit derivatives Each group has European and US representation It is unclear whether the clarification on the successor issue which will probably be released as a supplement later this summer will apply retroactively one market official said Basel comment period ends work for banks begins Reuters May By Alice Ratcliffe ZURICH May Reuters An industry comment period on new global capital rules dubbed Basel ends on Thursday but the work will just be starting for banks calculating how the sweeping changes will affect their businesses The new rules are due to be enforced in various legal jurisdictions starting in They will apply to most of the worlds banks now subject to the outmoded Basel Accord dating from Basel once adopted will also set standards for securities and brokerage firms in the European Union Despite outcry from some industry participants that the new rules were formulated too quickly supervisors appear set to complete Basel by yearend in time to implement it by according to industry sources One reason for the haste is that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision drafting the new rules worries an industry stalemate could delay adoption of the badlyneeded new rules in some key jurisdictions The implementation date is already seen as a sop to the lengthy EU legislative process Time Basel uses up eats into time for the EU directive said a source familiar with the issues adding the Basel Committee is between the devil and the deep blue sea SWEATING OVER CALIBRATION Of course that doesnt make the process any smoother Officially banks are to have all comments submitted by May Unofficial dialogues will likely continue for a long while One area of concern is Basel s approach to capital needed to cover lending exposure It allows for banks which meet certain qualifications to measure the risk of a borrower defaulting using an internal system in a way similar to an earlier advance adopted in the s is used to measure market risk In the approach to market risk banks deemed eligible by supervisors can use their own internal ValueatRisk VAR models to assess market risk to assess capital requirements Basel foresees letting eligible banks use an internal ratings based IRB approach to measure credit risk But unlike market risk banks are not allowed to use their own models to calculate the capital needed to cover credit risk at least not yet as such models are not deemed advanced enough for this Instead banks will compute their regulatory capital using their own internal ratings But they must then plug internal numbers into formulae spelled out by Basel computed on an indexed or calibrated basis This is where problems arise The first thing we said was that the calibration of the whole proposal has to be reworked said one banker Banks complain Basel s calibration formulae as spelled out in a draft published in January penalise the IRB approach saying setasides for risky corporates for example could be higher than what is called for by a standardised approach applied for less sophisticated banks One fear is that this could lead small and midsized banks using the standardised approach to wind up with a disproportionately larger exposure to riskier borrowers Supervisors are expected to work out the kinks however and are expected to take into account data collected by the Basel Committee under a Quantitative Impact Study wwwbisorg I have the strong impression there are going to be substantial changes to the document said one banker whose own institution had run simulations which took into account its profile including a large amount of emerging market loans He said the simulations showed his bank would have been seriously penalised by the earlier proposal But now it looks as though it will be changed The Basel Committee seems to be open to our point of view he said Banks are to submit findings on such technical issues to country regulators by June The Basel Committee could finish analysing these by October and is likely to incorporate them into the finished version of Basel OPERATIONAL RISK PALPITATIONS Operational risk is a new category foreseen by Basel alongside credit and market risk No one doubts that such risk exists But requiring banks to quantify it and set aside enough capital to satisfy regulators is proving another headache Some private bankers worry that asking banks to set aside capital for such risk could adversely affect the burgeoning business of wealth management which in theory requires a low capital base compared to lending or trading activities A lot of banks have gone into private banking and asset management and have paid a fortune to do so The message is they want these glamorous purchases because they need low capital and offer good returns said one European banker adding the original proposed changes move the goalposts The Basel Committee raised a storm when it suggested a capital set aside of percent a provisional figure for operational risk The final figure has not yet been set Basel defines operational risk as the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events and refers to an average of percent of economic capital Alongside smaller banks big ones are irked that the calculation ignores what one banker said was big banks more diversified income and hence reduced risk of failure Some banks would also like included in the calculation the hit absorption of a bank meaning that a bank making losses would first use income not capital as a cushion Hedge funds drive risk tool boom IFR May By Kathleen Fitzpatrick Dubbed virtual portfolios risk measurement services that include a whatif scenario along with the more traditional kind of risk analysis are gaining in importance The hypothetical feature allows for a more customised and flexible approach to the management of risk and answers situational hedging questions about a portfolio What would happen if I added a hedge into the portfolio What if I buy or sell futures are questions that Deutsche Banks dbRiskOffice scenario analysis can now address said Michelle McCarthy managing director risk analytics at Deutsche Bank Deutsches Whatif Positions Change enhancement released to clients in midMay includes features to determine changes in value at risk VAR tracking error and surplusatrisk resulting from a variety of hypothetical situations Deutsches client risk reporting system available via an internet browser specifically targets risk managers who outsource their risk measurement instead of building up an entire department to monitor their VAR Deutsches customers are keen on obtaining crossasset class VAR coverage according to McCarthy Managers who incorporate the use of the client risk reporting enhancement would have a better handle on whether a particular position will better correlate a fund to an index for example The current VAR analysis tools have already been mastered by the fund community which is now looking for better predictors of risk VAR is tied to a particular probability at present and fails to capture an exceptional move in an index for example said Guillaume Blacher senior managing director pricing advisory and risk management at Reech Capital in London Risk managers have been consistently going for greater flexibility added Deutsches McCarthy More managers want to work with the numbers rather than have a single number that comes out once a day she said referring to the benefits of scenario analysis over traditional risk measurement practices The hypothetical scenario tools along with the traditional VAR risk measurement systems are needed by fund managers in a complementary way stated Reech Capitals Blacher However the hypothetical tools give more flexibility to analyse potentially substantial losses VAR has shown its limitations it tends to capture bad days not the extremes according to Blacher Hypothetical analysis tools will assist the risk manager in deciphering what positions are needed to get back within a fund managers limit he added Option competition The need for faster and more reliable scenario hedging for managers investing in equity options has been a key driver of demand for whatif scenario analysis lately The stock option market has become tighter more competitive noted Ravi lain chief executive officer of Egar Technology a New York and Moscowbased firm that launched its own realtime equity options trading and risk management platform Equity Trading System last week We have already seen an incredible amount of interest from marketmakers moving upstairs and the hedge fund community lain said He also credits the more educated investor who may be prompting the fund manager to install better risk management and reporting systems particularly for option based funds as fuelling the current demand for hypothetical risk analysis Aside from the trading and risk management systems there is a lot of need for decision support tools he added Michael Gannon sales and marketing associate at Imagine Software the software maker that powers the Derivativescom trading site agreed that more sophisticated investors are a force behind fund manager demand for this kind of system Banks such as Deutsche Bank and Citigroup use Derivativescom risk measurement tools in their sellside operations according to Gannon And it is precisely the use by these banks that smaller Imagine Software clients like However the current risk measurement systems can be expensive for all but the largest trading organisations and especially for startup funds Hedge funds are not going to spend USm on buying a big system said Egars lain Instead he said they will investigate the more customisable decision analysis tools Imagine Software implemented its hypothetical whatif position analysis last year Its Derivativescom website features a hedge as you rehedge component that allows funds to rehedge during the simulation to give the portfolio a twodimensional realtime projection of a trade MicroHedge a webbased platform that caters to option traders also offers whatif scenario analysis in its MicroHedge Portfolio Risk product That platform however targets the needs of active marketmakers rather than hedge fund derivatives users The fact that these virtual portfolio hypothetical analysis tools are now available is beginning to make it easier for hedge funds to start up according to Imagines Cannon With the right risk analysis tools a hedge fund could be up and running in a week instead of hiring an entire IT staff he said Certainly the growth of hedge fund startups continues at rapid pace Hedge funds are expected to expand with a compound annual growth of according to a study by Freeman Co New UK Financial Regulator Draws Fire From Institutions The Wall Street Journal May By Silvia Ascarelli LONDON Will too much bureaucracy cause a logjam in the City A think tank warned of growing discontent among major financial institutions with the Financial Services Authority which this year will take over the duties of all of the financial regulatory agencies in the United Kingdom and said the FSAs style eventually could undermine the international competitiveness of the City as Londons financial district is known The FSA is seen as bureaucratic intrusive and insensitive and its regulatory style risks becoming a rulesbased system for the benefit of lawyers and compliance officials according to the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation in London The conclusions which are based on interviews with officials at about financial institutions including foreign banks with large operations in the UK come as the FSA nears a stillunnamed date when it will officially replace regulators and different rule books During the past four years the FSA has been a virtual regulator that contracted some of its duties to the agencies that it will replace The FSA said the think tank which admits it began with negative preconceptions ended up with some positive conclusions For instance the study found little evidence despite many complaints that the FSAs approach has cost the Londons financial center any business Rather it found that the FSA is seen as more sophisticated than other European regulators and that new banks and companies are setting up shop in the UK at an unprecedented pace The think tank itself acknowledged that some of the institutions may be grumbling because they prefer the old regime and because the FSA isnt completely formed The think tank also warned of inexorable forces driving the City toward rulebound regulation rather than a more flexible individual approach Some respondents said they feared that the FSA may be less hospitable to innovation and startup companies The CSFI also claimed that regulatory costs are rising in most parts of the City because of higher compliance costs An FSA spokesman said the report didnt back that claim up with hard analysis and that indirect costs are included in the costbenefit analysis that the agency performs on policy proposals US Equity Derivatives FOW May By Anuszka Ranslev The economic slowdown of global markets has had a dramatic effect on the US equity derivatives market Although the underlying market is proving to be quite uncertain traders report a remarkable time for equity derivatives One trader describes this as probably the single best I environment for equity derivatives that weve seen in the last decade Compressed levels of volatility at the beginning of the year combined with uncertainty in the market has lead to an increased usage of equity y derivatives While volatility levels dropped in the first few months of the year due to supply and demand factors the past month has seen volatilities begin to move up again However one USbased broker warns that volatilities have not moved up as much as the market would expect We would predict with the current supply and demand imbalance that vols would rise more significantly than they have he says The fact that vols have not risen in this way creates good value for those looking to use equity derivatives Meanwhile there are reports of a diversity of business being traded across the board with no significant markets being favoured While February saw no signs of a herd mentality since March there has been much copycat trading going on This has lead to reports of the US leading the market with Europe and Asia following However at the beginning of April traders report some diversions from this copycat trading particularly with the Nikkei rising by several per cent Convertibles remain the core of activity in the market A dealer comments If you can get the premium high enough although people arent crazy about selling their stock at this level convertible financing is pretty viable The demand in the convertible market has lead

dealer warns There is a lot of new money that has moved into this arena but there are just not that many new funds and now as funds come on there arent that many convertibles available The convertible market continues to offer zeros with many large over night deals being witnessed One trader comments that The big buyers of convertibles believe that the arbitrage funds are very material to the market although they would prefer them on a hedge basis with more attractive volatility However he warns In this market of convertibles you need to be aware of where you can get stock off where the credit should be trading and where you can distribute that credit Traders report a record year so far in equity derivatives and speculate that the market is the one area in investment banking other than fixed income that is really having a good year A head of desk concludes This is a period of divergence where there is so much uncertainty in the market that it is hard to trade and hard to take

lust being felt in the credit derivatives market While not viewed as the final word on the tricky issue of R the modifications have been broadly welcomed When Ernest Goodrich md of Deutsche Bank announced at ISDAs recent AGM that a consensus had been reached on the credit derivative markets restructuring problem the audience held its breath Despite the heavy hints that ISDA was going to make such a timely announcement things had not looked promising However at the eleventh hour ISDA announced its Restructuring Supplement to the ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions Clarity The definitions of restructuring were a huge improvement on the previous ISDA confirmations says Thomas Riggs vp and associate general counsel of Goldman Sachs However they were a compromise and exposed credit protection sellers to risks that cannot easily be priced or managed Clearly something had to be done A clearer definition of R will be beneficial says Paolo Josca head of credit derivatives in New York for Banca Commerciale Italiana Restructuring is often the first sign of a company in distress Josca admits however that even if the ISDA modification becomes adopted as a market standard variations will still exist Brian Barrett director at Merrill Lynch agrees The main complaint following Conseco was that the restructuring clause exposed credit protection sellers to the protection buyers cheapesttodeliver option To address these complaints dealers have proposed to substantially limit the permitted maturities of deliverables if the buyer triggers the settlement of a default swap based on R as a credit event Despite dealers attempts to find this common ground I am not sure that the modified R will be acceptable to all Many traders are sceptical that a single uniform contract for credit derivatives is possible However there is broad agreement that a clear standard framework is needed ISDA expects that trades will still continue without R but hopes that the new supplement will ease levels of confusion and reduce the RINR spread In fact Dennis Oakley ISDA treasurer and md of JP Morgan cites a recent fiveyear default swap that traded with the new R supplement only two basis points more expensive than NR The old restructuring clause has been as much as Olbp more expensive The main elements of the new restructuring definition Limit the number of alternatives to one revised approach which is preferable to having more options Impose a maturity limitation on deliverables State that deliverables must be fully transferable Take into account the BIS proposals on the restructuring compromise Of course the new Basel capital adequacy proposal requires restructuring in credit derivatives in order for them to qualify for capital relief What impact will ISDAs new modification have on this document ISDA states that the BIS proposal is still at an early stage and argues that it made more sense for the Association to develop its restructuring modification first introduce it to the market and then take it to the regulators This new option is structured on the same lines as other ISDA supplements explains Richard Kennaugh md of JP Morgan You can specify the extent to which you want to incorporate the supplement into your transaction it is easily done within a sentence or two We hope everyone utilises the modified version Positive While this may not be the final word on restructuring and while it may come under attack for being too US big bank biased or not going far enough ISDAs new restructuring supplement is generally considered to be a positive development for the credit derivatives market There has been a high degree of noise about restructuring in recent months says Blythe Masters global head of credit derivatives at JP Morgan This is only natural and is indicative of the fact that the credit derivatives business has grown sufficiently to be on the financial radar screen Credit Derivatives FOW May By Jane Sandiford Underpinning recent wellpublicised developments in the industry the credit derivatives market is seeing a steady flow of business with volumes up on the same time last year We have been doing some quite interesting portfolio trades says one trader We have also structured some tax arbitrage trades synthetic collateralized debt obligations and completed a lot of relative value trades Interestingly we have been pricing up some spread options again we have not done that since This is probably the result of recent market volatility and credit spread widening While we have not seen anything ground breaking we have been doing some interesting I deals recently Another trader points to the increasing accessibility of more structured credit derivatives deals At one stage in the not too distant past we would not have attempted to get involved in the more exotic transactions such as synthetics he explains However now we are quite involved in this market the mystery has gone and we can now see what we can do with these instruments In addition Deutsche Bank has recently structured an interesting deal The deals floatingrate notes have been provisionally rated by SP At closing Deutsche Bank will issue eurodenominated notes As there is no collateral for the notes Deutsche Bank will pay the principal and interest on the notes Deutsche Banks obligation is however linked to the performance of a static EURbn reference portfolio of investmentgrade reference entities There exists therefore a credit risk not only on Deutsche Banks ability to repay the notes but also on the performance of the reference pool explains Katrien Van Acoleyen associate at SPs structured finance ratings group in London Both of these issues are adequately addressed by the BB rating If a credit event occurs in the reference portfolio all the conditions to payment have been met and the total losses with respect to the portfolio exceed the threshold amount then the repayment of the notes will be reduced with the cash settlement amount defaulted amount less recovery as calculated by Deutsche Bank as calculation agent At the same time as the notes are issued Deutsche Bank will also enter into two unfunded credit default swaps which are senior to the notes Final maturity of the notes is April but the notes can redeem early if the notional amount has been reduced to zero and ii when an event of default or adverse tax change occurs on the notes Meanwhile credit derivative brokers are looking to market the product to new potential users We have been looking to target energy and utility houses says one The credit risk aspect of energy has really hit home over the past year especially following the bankruptcy filing from the US Pacific Gas and Electricity Company Those companies that are exposed to such energy risk are now seeking the protection that can be offered via credit derivatives Energy companies are not the only institutions feeling the pain of energy risk One market source warns that some synthetic securitisation structures issued by major credit derivatives players may be under pressure and may be downgraded as a result of the impact of the Californian power crisis Some of these deals have exposure to US power utilities says the source This is something we are watching very closely indeed As FOW went to press the full impact of ISDAs new restructuring modification had yet to be felt We are waiting for our lawyers to go through the supplement and come back with their recommendations says one structurer However it seems a sensible solution and is along the lines of what we have seen developing in the market I would agree with comments that the new supplement will narrow credit spreads While this may not be the end of the matter it is good news for credit derivatives

Victor Kremer The International Swaps and Derivatives Association over the next several weeks will canvass credit derivative dealers hedgers and investors with a view to revising socalled soft credit event definitions in credit derivative documentation Bob Pickel executive director and CEO of ISDA in New York told DW there will be changes to the credit event definitions declining to put a timeframe on the move The issue has been a focus of discussion as the synthetic CDO and credit default swap markets have grown but raised eyebrows recently when Moodys Investors Service and Deutsche Bank engaged in a skirmishvia conflicting research reportson the potential magnitude and probability of soft credit events according to market professionals The debate centers on credit events that are short of outright bankruptcy or default being included in credit derivative contracts ISDA documentation recognizes credit events that do not necessarily entail a default such as the in furtherance of clause of the bankruptcy definition which could cover an obligor considering filing for bankruptcy explained Jeffrey Tolk vp and senior credit officer at Moodys in New York If publicly reported Tolk continued these considerations could trigger a loss payment under a credit default swap even if the obligor does not enter bankruptcy In a report published at the beginning of the month Deutsche Bank concedes that synthetic credit instruments may carry an element of documentation basis risk that is not present in a conventional cash security However John Tierney the reports author continues We think Moodys goes too far in implying that the presence of certain credit events in synthetic securities exposes investors ie protection sellers to a materially greater degree of default risk and loss Its an unquantifiable risk and that makes us and investors uncomfortable said Moodys Tolk Rather than overstating the issue the rating agency asserts that the definition of these soft credit events is so broad that their inclusion in documentation exposes investors to an unknown level of risk ISDA seems to be considering our point of view he continued ISDAs Pickel confirmed that the association is moving towards Moodys definitions The associations G subcommittee of the Credit Derivatives Market Practice Group met last Tuesday to set an agenda for tackling the credit definitions Several investors said they share Moodys concerns with the inclusion of soft credit event definitions in ISDA documentation Thats where it gets a little dicey one investor noted adding that the soft credit definitions should be dropped A credit derivatives trader in London noted ISDA is in the early stages of looking at the definitions but agreed that some credit event definitions might be taken out of the ISDA documentation You dont have to wait for ISDA he said adding that counterparties can agree to strike the language from their documentation when they enter transactions Its the end of the w as we know it FOW May By Jane Sandiford Is the end nigh for w Judging from comments at ISDAs AGM last month the future looks bleak for Basels now infamous proposed capital charge for credit derivatives Derided by the very regulators you would expect to defend it traders now question how w can survive Market views on the whole have been negative explains Roger Tufts senior economic advisor capital policy division at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency I expect that w will eventually go away The credit derivatives market has condemned the charge in no uncertain terms and the comments from the ISDA ACM have been broadly welcomed It is good to hear the regulators admit that w makes no sense to them either says one trader I would now expect w to be clarified and at the very least the capital charge reduced The need for clarity on this and other features of the Basel proposal was noted at the ISDA AGM by William McDonough chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York I know that it is of particular concern that we may be confusing legal risks with other risks I think this is right Emmanuelle Sebton head of risk management at ISDA is particularly heartened to hear McDonoughs comments She hopes by bringing more clarity on the nature and purpose of the w charge the debate that ISDA has had with the regulators will eventually lead to the conclusion that the charge is unjustified and should be removed from the proposed Capital Accord I agree with McDonoughs comments on the w factor says Thomas Boemio senior supervisory financial analyst policy development section on the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System We call w the whatever factor We are not sure what it is for it is mainly a legal risk As such the market believes w should be consigned to the operational risk area The US regulators seem to be in agreement what is not so clear is the position the European regulators will take However with criticism coming from all sides of the debate traders believe that xv will soon be consigned to the dustbin of history a lucky near miss for credit derivatives ISDA fights for right to counterparty FOW May By Corinne Smith The International Swaps Derivatives Association ISDA announced at its recent AGM its proposals for the treatment of counterparty credit risk as part of its response to the easel Committees proposed new Capital Accord ISDA responded to Basels first consultative paper in February last year saying that the current treatment of counterparty risk could be improved and needed further work before setting a new framework for a regulatory capital charge In October last year we created the Counterparty Risk Working Group to formulate ISDAs response which was chaired by Tom Wilde director at Credit Suisse First Boston and which represented institutions nine of which participated in a quantitative calibration exercise says Katia DHulster policy director at ISDA in London We have now finalised our proposals and they will be included as an annex to our official Basel response which is due by the end of May Although ISDA completed the major part of its work on counterparty credit risk before the publication of Basels second consultative paper in January the Association was pleased to note a paragraph about the Committees willingness to accept potential future exposure PFE modelling in the document a sign of progress towards addressing counterparty risk on a more risk sensitive basis Internal models The current rules for counterparty risk require institutions to calculate a credit equivalent exposure for derivatives as the sum of the current value if positive and an add on obtained by multiplying the derivative notional by fixed regulatory factors depending on the underlying market This is a very crude way of calculating a regulatory capital charge for counterparty risk explains DHulster What we propose is that the Basel Committee allow banks to calculate these credit equivalent exposures using their internal models Just as in the current rules however these exposures would then be risk weighted in the same way as other credit assets This twostep approach is one aspect of the current rules that we are not proposing to change In the first step banks calculate credit equivalent exposures and in the second step these exposures are treated as normal credit assets The alternative is to use internal models to calculate capital directly from derivatives positions ISDA regards this as the ultimate goal but recognises that it must follow in the footsteps of internal modelling for fixed exposures which the regulators are not yet ready to accept For firms that do not have internal models of counterparty risk the existing method could remain in place with some modification However many banks already have appropriate internal models for these calculations although they would need to be reviewed and approved by regulators We recommend that for the calculation of credit equivalent exposures banks use the concept of expected positive exposure says Wilde By the end of this year the Basel Committee will have prepared its final proposals so we would like it to consider our work on counterparty risk We would also like to see the European Union consider our work in its Capital Adequacy Directive Bankers Call Credit Their No Risk Fear American Banker May By Nicole Darn WASHINGTON Bankers say credit economic capital and systems risk in that order are their top three risk management concerns Capital Market Risk Advisors a New York financial advisory firm specializing in risk management surveyed bankers worldwide on their risk management concerns and thoughts about economic capital The firm found emergingmarket and investment banks were more gravely concerned about integrating market and credit risk than did nonemergingmarket foreign banks US banks and other financial institutions Of the banks surveyed said they use internal models for marketrisk regulatory capital and use the Basel standardized measurement method Of those using the Basel method said they plan to move to internal models None of the emergingmarket banks said they use internal models now but said they plan to Most of the major banks and investment banks said they are currently using internal models Sixtythree percent of all bank respondents said that if the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision would let banks use their own credit risk models now they would not yet be ready to make the switch BoEs Clementi Cautions Knowledge Of Systemic Risk Low Dow Jones Newswires May By David Cottle LONDON The Bank of Englands role in combating systemic risk arouses far more internal debate than its monetary policy the Banks Deputy Governor David Clementi said Wednesday In a speech on Banks and Systemic Risk at the Bank of Englands annual conference Clementi said that while the target for inflation is clear and transparent the global understanding of systemic risk is in a very preliminary stage He added that the very definition of such risk along with the problems of measuring it and the policy weapons used to combat it remain fundamental questions which the international banking community so far has provided only partial answers He pointed to a lack of evidence of systemic shocks Whilst banking crises are not exactly rare they are episodic rather than regular and they tend to exhibit a number of idiosyncratic characteristics he said What is not in doubt Clementi added is that financial crises specifically banking crises produce real economic costs He highlighted the immediate costs to the public sector if ailing banks have to be bailed out in addition to longer term costs to growth He pointed out that banking crises have become more common with four out of the G most developed countries suffering one in the last decade Clementi said that the increasing trend in global banking towards consolidation may lead to safer banks in the long run it could also make bank failure more damaging in its impact Additionally the changing nature of bank activity also affects risk profiles he said New markets new customers new products new technology increase the risk of something going wrong if the industrys risk assessment procedures do not keep pace he said He highlighted the need to risk proof the global banking system through measures such as the Basel Accord on capital adequacy Market discipline and disclosure are two cornerstones of this process Clement said He added however that there is no point in enhancing disclosures if the market has no incentive to apply the information because it believes that banks will not be allowed to fail The goal of improving and harnessing market discipline has to go hand in hand with the continued rolling back of state guarantees to banks whether formal or implicit he said On the implications of the Basel accord for the level of capital in the banking system Clementi stressed the need to achieve a balance Erring on the low side of a minimum capital standard could result in an unacceptable risk whereas to err on the high side is likely to result in wasteful and costly regulatory arbitrage he said EU collateral Directive FOW May By Jane Sandiford ISDA is now asking jurisdictions around the world to update their legal opinion on the document We anticipate that the process depending on the jurisdiction should take six months says ISDAs assistant general counsel Kimberley Summe Those requests for counsel will go out this month and I would anticipate that by late fall we should have them in and well then make them available on our Website While the new provisions have been broadly welcomed significant hurdles remain There are considerable technical constraints to be overcome to enact the documentation says James Crabb head of collateral management at Barclays Capital Crabb warns that the documentation is biased in favour of larger banks that have access to a wider range of collateral Meanwhile the EU has proposed a new Directive to create a uniform EU legal framework to limit credit risk in financial transactions through the provision of securities and cash as collateral The Directive is largely in keeping with ISDAs new Provisions This Directive promises to support the growing use of collateral in the EU removing many unnecessary obstacles says Robert Pickel ISDAs Executive Director and CEO The EUs internal market commissioner Frits Bolkestein says that the proposal is the first step towards integration of the financial market for collateral in the EU He adds that the proposal tackles a major disincentive to crossborder transactions Market operators currently face different legal regimes for the provision of collateral complicated potential conflicts between jurisdictions and uncertainties surrounding the law applicable to crossborder transfers of securities This proposal would determine which law governs crossborder collateral arrangements and would make it possible for market participants to conclude such arrangements in the same manner throughout the EU says Bolkestein China to Ease Rate Rules The New York Times May SHANGHAI May China plans to relax its control of foreign currency lending rates by the second half of the year China Securities News has reported Banks will be permitted to adjust their foreign currency lending rates to bring them more into line with market demand than they are permitted to now Foreign currency lending rates are now set by the central bank The change is part of a plan to permit banks to set all lending rates within years and all deposit rates within to years the paper said Relaxing state control is a critical step toward achieving the governments goal of making the countrys currency fully convertible Devaluation Talk Just That And No More A Dow Jones Newswires Column May By James Areddy HONG KONG Markets make it a rule to ignore government promises not to devalue a currency But it also makes sense to disregard statements from Beijing that sound as if its commitment to a stable currency has waned In Malaysia economists have glazed right over promises from Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad that the ringgits peg is secure since sentiment is widespread that the exchange rate is unsustainable It was the same thing in February when Turkeys government expressed its support for the lira before it crashed and the way markets also cast a suspicious eye toward indebted Argentinas peso Some even regard devaluation plans as one of the few times a government has a good reason to lie since officials have a mandate to maintain market confidence in the national currency as long as possible So its strange to hear Chinese officials not market players hint they have lost the faith Instead of highlighting Chinas strong balance of payments position or that it has the worlds second largest trove of foreign exchange reserves as other governments might officials have made headlines in recent weeks by pointing out the yuan exchange rates stress points Their statements bring many traders back to and the then downward spiral of the Japanese yen When the US currency started climbing toward Y in the middle of that year China led the rest of Asia with acrimonious statements that Japans failure to address its economic problems undermined market confidence in the yen Threatened by China with a competitive devaluation of the yuan at a time of extreme global financial turmoil authorities in the US and Japan put an end to the yens slide with welltimed intervention in world currency markets Chinese devaluation fears receded as the yen rebounded on worries about more intervention Now some think they hear echoes of the past in Chinas rhetoric A clouding of the US economic picture sour relations with Washington and most of all the new vulnerability of Japans yen help make the latest Chinese arguments sound shrill A consistent depreciation of the yen against the dollar would create pressure on the stability of the yuan exchange rate the Peoples Bank of China warned this month China needs to take measures to improve the competitiveness of its exports the countrys Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation chimed in a few days later No Face Value Yet the way things stand now virtually no one takes Chinas worries at face value Gray market rates of the yuan in Hong Kong are stable and point to strengthening while purveyors of derivatives who offer plays on the nonconvertible yuan are having a dull spell One analyst says China is merely reminding the market that its commitment doesnt equate stability in the yuan forever and no matter what Another said Asia collectively wants to keep pressure on Japan noting South Korea also hackled when the yen headed south And its not a critical situation Chinas current account balance is expected to remain in surplus of of gross domestic product this year albeit down from of GDP last year according to Goldman Sachs Co The firms early warning signals pick up no financial risk regarding China Yes analysts say Beijing is concerned that another big fall in the Japanese currency would weaken its ability to compete with Japanese companies in thirdparty export markets like the US It would also reduce Chinas ability to carve out space in the liberalizing Japanese market and to draw investment from Japanese companies But Chinas actions speak louder than its words on the currency The yuan has remained rock solid for over seven years in the face of both downward and upward pressures some of them severe as in And its worth noting the words themselves have been anything but alarmist so far In fact analysts say Beijing has reassured that it will allow market forces to set the yuan only gradually PBOC Gov Dai Xianglongs bottom line is that the yuan will remain stable although not fixedso please rest assured Chinas myriad political and economic considerations growing oil import dependency budding statesmanship and hopes to get top dollar in its privatizations make it difficult to argue that devaluation would provide a net benefit Nor is it easy to say China has less responsibility to the rest of Asia than it did three years ago when the regions economies were being pummeled Chinese devaluation then most certainly would have forced a new round of currency instability throughout a highly indebted and crisishit Asia But while a weaker Chinese currency now probably wouldnt collapse Asian economies it would be hard to pull off without making Beijing look greedy Chinas buoyant albeit weaker export figures support the view that it continues to take market share away from the rest of the region increasingly in the critical electronics sector The region is already unsettled by the singular focus foreign investors have on China China has accounted for virtually all of the regions equity fund raising so far this year up from of the total last year according to Deutsche Bank AG The argument that China would use a devaluation to punish the US for downgrading relations also fails to hold water The punch it would give other Asian countries would undermine the Chinese leaderships recent whirlwind of diplomacy through Asia And with US relations in the dumps China now needs friends in the region more than at any time during the past decade according to Yiping Huang a Citigroup Inc economist in Hong Kong A devaluation would also upset the countrys existing foreign investors People who last year pumped US billion into Chinese stocks and US billion into factories and such on the mainland would look like suckers who paid too much A sudden drop in the currency would also probably crash the Hong Kong stock market denting the interests of a lot of those China is counting on to provide recurrent FDI and demand in future stock offerings analysts point out The Ministry of Finance sent no devaluation signals this month to the investors around the globe who demonstrated an overwhelmingly positive response to its first sovereign bond offering in about three years according to Dennis Zhu who helped organize the US billion dollareuro deal Zhu JP Morgan Chase Cos China head of investment banking said that may be because investors think China has the ability to control its currency and he downplayed the risks altogether It would be different for a country like Thailand or Malaysia where balance of payment weaknesses make a controlled devaluation less of a certainty Zhu said Or consider the US export market China is trying to climb the technology ladder but where it competes most is in the consumer realm where weaker demand would surely affect its sales of clothes and toys Increasingly for these type of goods says Coudert Bros trade attorney Owen Nee the choice is do you buy from China or do you buy from Mexico And the peso is trading near threeyear highs against the US dollar Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia Ltd like many other houses was wrong in to bet on a Chinese currency fall and it still sees Beijing as frantic at the prospects of seeing exports or foreign exchange reserves slip The obvious solution would be to allow the currency to depreciate according to Chief Economist Jim Walker But now he puts the currency question in a broader context When top posts are shifted in the Chinese government next year reformers like Prime Minister Zhu Rongji will want incoming policy makers to back their decisions such as to join the World Trade Organization Devaluation according to Walker would make China appear weak in the face of the global competition the reformers have so embraced Still according to CLSA expect the rhetoric and the risk to increase sharply if the yen trades through Y New CEO Helps Build Future For Singapore Exchange Asia Wall Street Journal May By Shu Shin Luh Singapore A year ago last month Tom Kloet became the most senior foreigner ever appointed to Singapores stock and futures exchanges since the islands colonial times The Americans appointment as the chief executive of the Singapore Exchange Ltd after a yearlong search fits with the Singapore governments push to attract foreign talent who will advance the island nations position as a cuttingedge regional financial hub The Singapore Exchange became Asias first integrated securities and derivatives exchange after a merger of the Singapore Stock Exchange and the Singapore International Monetary Exchange in December The exchange saw an exodus of longtime executives during its early days Mr Kloet who had been a senior managing director at ABN Amro in Chicago and a board member at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange arrived in April and spent his first months rebuilding a senior management team Since then the exchange has gone public and established various alliances such as with the American Stock Exchange and the Australian Stock Exchange among other highlights Three weeks ago the exchange joined a growing number of Singapore companies that are reporting financial earnings quarterly as part of the citystates effort to improve corporate transparency Mr Kloet speaks about his first year at the exchange in an interview The following is an edited excerpt Q What do you think are the highlights of your first year as CEO A Weve embarked on a number of exciting initiatives including everything from a solid new management team to new alliances Seven out of of the people on my team werent with the institution months ago plus me But weve hired a group that is great We have a cohesiveness being built thats very important Together with that we have successfully completed the transfer of our company from an entity that operated like a memberowned organization to a customerdriven organization It takes time but were making progress on that including privatizing and taking the company public with the stock If I may borrow Winston Churchills words thats not the end not even the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning to create the future of the exchange As an institution with a smaller domestic market we believe we have to reach out to enter a network of relationships Q Was it difficult to build a new management team A When I came there were definitely a few holes we had to fill There were a few who chose to leave We didnt tell them to do it Theres a lot of talent here in Singapore But we also brought in people from outside Singapore where we thought we needed expertise that we couldnt find in Singapore Q Many multinationals aim to recruit locally for their offices in Asia Do you also try to do the same for the exchange A Some jobs will require us to go outside because the business line simply doesnt exist here Clearly our first choice would be to look domestically for people we see every day and who know this market But we will look where we can get for the best people and thats the only thing that drives us Q Recently Singapore has encouraged local companies to recruit global talent You are certainly one of them What are your thoughts on global talent A Whether Im Singaporean American French or from wherever is not the issue The most important thing is will I help the exchange fulfill its ambition in the global marketplace I would interpret the governments move to be bring the talent as needed I wouldnt say its easy to attract people to move But Singapore is an easy place to get acclimated to The commute is short the lifestyle here is pretty good I personally like the climate People find it easy to raise families here In relative terms Singapore is a pretty easy sale Q How difficult was it for the exchange to transition from a governmentrun organization to a commercial one A I think its still evolving Thats not a cultural change the CEO dictates Its a cultural change the institution moves toward I think were moving as fast as we could Certainly members and participants are important to listen to We want to make sure our team doesnt lose the focus to listen The change to a commercial entity requires one to consider the profitandloss ramifications of the services you provide We also provide a regulatory function I think weve found the balancing act Doing it is not as easy Q How has the exchange benefited from going public A First off it gives the institution a certain freedom to act as a commercial entity Also it puts a financial discipline on the organization that a member organization generically might not have Like any new public company we make sure were as transparent as we can be We gave third quarter results three weeks ago We think its the right thing to do We want to make sure the exchange is setting a standard for global best practices We are making an effort to be as transparent and still be effective in the marketplace Were learning Q Being transparent goes hand in hand with good corporate governance a topic frequently discussed here How do Singapore companies measure up to that A Over the last three years I think Singapore has made terrific strides to improving the corporate governance We announced we would adopt the corporate governance code and require our listed companies to disclose noncompliance to that code Rather than prescribing a set of corporate governance requirements that says heres what the standards should be we think we should tell shareholders when somethings wrong Thats the best for the market at this time I admire Singapore as somebody whos come on scene late for not withstanding the improvement that have been made to yet take the next step They are not sitting and resting on the laurels but taking the next step Q How have you applied your experiences serving as a board member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to your management of the exchange here A Its the ability to think outside the box a bit Our whole management team is learning to do it here You have to make sure your people know that its not bad to be wrong One cant be afraid to be wrong but dont be wrong because you havent done the research An idea should be able to come up from anywhere in the organization There should also be a trust level between colleagues As the CEO I try to encourage having an institution where anybody in the institution can email me I tell everyone to call me Tom I would say thats quite unusual in the Singapore context ISDA Opposes the FASBs Proposed Changes on Hybrid Instruments HedgeWorld May By Christopher Faille NEW YORK HedgeWorldcomThe International Swap Dealers Association wishes the Financial Accounting and Standards Board would adhere to the old adage if it aint broke dont fix it That is the gist of the ISDA comment filed on April in response to an FASB exposure draft on accounting for compound financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity such as convertible bonds The amount of change to the accounting model that has taken place in the last four years has been enormous Such change has put a strain on the resources of both the financial statement preparer community as well as those of the financial statement users who are still tying to digest the significance of the new guidance so far and adjust their analytics accordingly their comment argued The ISDA is particularly unhappy about what it calls bifurcationthat is the idea implicit in the exposure draft that an instrument should be broken down unto liability and equity components which can then be assigned to their place on the balance sheet and accounted for separately The ISDA acknowledges one important point in favor of the proposed change it would bring American standards in line with the approach employed by the International Accounting Standards Commission and thus contribute to convergence But the ISDA adds that it does not consider their acceptance of bifurcation to be an obligation for adoption by US standard setters One industry authority consulted by HedgeWorld suggested that the volume and sophistication of the market for convertibles in the United States makes this country a special case and justifies nonconvergence The source also indicated that bifurcation is not a simple matter because it may create the misleading appearance that the liability and equity components of an instrument are entirely unrelated whereas in economic fact and as marketed they are intertwined Some industry skepticism notwithstanding this exposure draft seems not to have stirred up the same sort of hornets nest as have other recent FASB initiatives such as the recent elimination of asset pooling for mergers All mergers initiated after June must use the purchase method In a closely related move the FASB has also lately determined that effective next year pure goodwill recorded on corporate balance sheets will no longer be amortized but will be subjected to an impairment approach In a page report issued in mid May a financial services firm Friedman Billings Ramsey Co concluded that the net effects of these changes will be bullish for stocks We anticipate the psychological perception of applying current PE ratios to higher future GAAP earnings will result in higher stock prices wrote the FBRs senior analyst Laurie Hunsicker Ms Hunsicker acknowledges that the new accounting methods do not change the underlying economic realities but expects that psychology will trump such matters Banks account Financial Times May Who could argue against the disclosure of fair values in company accounts Bankers who are seething over plans to change the way they account for financial instruments such as derivatives and loans to customers The plans have been drawn up by the Joint Working Group a body made up mainly of accounting standardsetters from the worlds biggest economies Bankers say the results would lead to dramatic swings in the value of balance sheet assets that would often be meaningless and potentially damaging It is certainly the case that the existing accounting rules often fail to reflect the impact of changes in interest rates or credit risks on bank earnings Fair value accounting would force banks to adjust their accounts in the light of rises and falls in the values of all financial instruments The result would be greater volatility in profits but proponents of the change say it would give investors a truer picture of corporate health Not so say the banks While fair value accounting is appropriate for trading activities it would not reflect the real business of making longterm loans to customers which are largely held to maturity and therefore rarely traded Banks manage loan portfolios to make a stable interest margin over the terms of the loans not on the profits determined each year in relation to the interest rate at the time This is more than an academic argument Supporters of fair value accounting say the existing state of affairs masks the real financial position of banks one reason why banks are often given lower stock market ratings than securities houses which mark their loans to market Opponents say the volatility of fair value accounting would not only confuse consumers and investors it could lead banks to withdraw from lending that caused volatility even though it was safe At worst the result would be to amplify the economic cycle with sudden withdrawals of credit accentuating the downturn when markets slow The issue is further complicated by the continuing international negotiations over the amount of capital banks have to hold The new Basle accord would base capital requirements on risk assessments rather than market pricing leading some bankers to fear a divergence between the Basle formula and accounting standards It is impossible to argue against greater transparency in bank accounting but it should be recognised that there is more than one way to capture financial reality Much more work is needed before fair value accounting can be proclaimed as the right answer for banks IASB Taking Tentative Steps on Agenda With Help From National Rulemaking Groups BNA May By Steve Burkholder LONDONThe International Accounting Standards Board took more steps May to set its rulemaking agenda placing fasttrack efforts to improve existing standards and to ease companies switching to international rules at the front of a long docket The steps are tentative however Under its constitution IASB must consult with its advisory councilwhich is yet to be namedbefore it can formally fix an agenda A meeting with the advisory panel is expected to take place in July The improvements project is an omnibus effort intended to mend a variety of rules IASB inherited from its predecessor board the International Accounting Standards Committee and to rid those standards of inconsistencies and inappropriate choices in accounting methods The transition or firsttime application project is being watched closely by the Big accounting firms and their European clientcompanies That audience is mindful of the planned European Union directive that would require some companies in the region to carry out their financial reporting using international standards by New Rules by End of For that to occur and to remedy the concerns of securities regulators IASB effectively has to significantly improve a variety of accounting rules and issue new ones by the end of In addition IASB expects to tackle a project on business combinations quickly and hopes to have it done in comparatively short order The focus of the planned work on merger and acquisition accounting would be to consider barring the poolingofinterests method of accounting and adopt the purchase method instead IASB also plans to target the treatment of goodwill a key element in purchase accounting and weigh a possible adoption of impairment against the survival of the writedown of goodwill acquired in a combination As with all standardsetting projects and less substantial efforts the board has its eye on convergence It is working toward issuing a single set of high quality accounting rules that could be used by companies around the world in raising capital Heavy Involvement of National Boards The path to that goal will include heavy involvement of major national standardsetting bodies in the rulemaking of IASB The mechanisms for that workwhich are to include joint projects and other partnership working arrangementswere detailed in a meeting May with the heads of standardsetting panels from Australia Canada France Germany Japan New Zealand the United Kingdom and the United States IASB has formal liaison relationships with those boards A sharing of human resources by the sparely staffed IASB and groups such as the US Financial Accounting Standards Board would be complemented by a trading of knowledge the rulemakers suggested I expect that the FASB will gain as much as it gets out of the work of IASB FASB Chairman Edmund Jenkins told the international board and his counterparts from around the world IASB Not a Dictator At the May meeting IASB Chairman David Tweedie and his colleagues sought to provide assurances that the newly restructured international panel will not usurp the authority of the national standardsetters In forging sharedwork arrangements on topics such as stockbased compensation or sharebased payments revenue recognition and consolidations policy there will be no directives to national boards to arrive a particular conclusion Tweedie suggested IASB is not a dictator Its simply a facilitator he said Earlier in the meeting Hans Havermann chairman of the German accounting standards board discussed the IASBnational boards model for working toward converging rules and stated that the autonomy and independence of the local standardsetters must remain intact In response James Leisenring a former longtime FASB member now serving on IASB suggested the model of joint projects and shared labor and research is not intended to be a threat to the autonomy of any national board The notion behind convergence he added is to put some pressure on all of us to get to the same answer and work with a spirit of cooperation That does not mean however that IASB and a national board with which it works on a particular project will be assured of arriving at the same answer Leisenring said They always have the right to reach different conclusions he said of the national boards In summarizing the May discussion on rulemakingbypartnership Tweedie said that there would be a method of resolving conflicts which he called an important issue The IASB chairman noted that rulemaking agendas of the international board and the major national standardsetters will have to be aligned Such an alignment means also that due process schedulesfor example comment periods on draft ruleswill have to be coordinated as at least one participant in the meeting suggested Tentative Listing of HighPriority Projects Besides the improvements transition and combinations project IASBs list of highpriority technical efforts includes sharebased payments or stockbased compensation a controversial project that would have an expected goal of expensing stock options DTR G reporting financial performance which IASB and FASB members have suggested could hold the key to acceptability of controversial moves toward fair value in accounting especially for financial instruments financial instruments which possibly could mean a nearterm repair of the flawed International Accounting Standard while moving more deliberately toward full fair valuebased measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities distinguishing between liabilities and equity a project similar to the pending FASB project focusing on classifying such items as mandatorily redeemable preferred securities consolidations policy or determining on what basis a company should consolidate subsidiaries it effectively controls despite lack of equity ownership a project that has bedeviled FASB for some years measurement objectives which would focus on such questions as fair value versus deprival valuethe latter an accounting concept in Great Britainas an avenue to better use of presentvaluebased methods of measurement and associated notions of discounting and estimating future cash flows DTR G revenue recognition with the related tasks of devising rules on liability recognition and possibly having to revise or devise bedrock definitions a likely prospect in the liabilitiesequity effort also insurance contracts impairment and derecognition Parts of that full plate of high priority items are expected to be taken up at IASBs next meeting in late June As described by Tweedie May the last day of the boards fourday meeting the tentative agenda for that meeting includes transition issues obviously a big issue business combinations performance reporting more agendasetting with a refining of assignment of priorities and the measurement objectives topic Asian Airlines Tender For Jet Fuel Through JetAcom Dow Jones May By Jeremy Bowden SINGAPORE All Nippon Airways Co Ltd JANA and Japan Airlines Co Ltd JAPNY are among several major airlines to have tendered for part of their jet fuel needs through a new Internet platform JetAcom according to oil traders The Internet site is backed by major airlines including the two Japanese carriers and other Asianbased airlines including Singapore Airlines Ltd PSAL Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd HCPA and Air New Zealand Ltd AAIZ The site is also backed by six major oil companies including BP PLC BP Exxon Mobil Corp XOM Chevron Corp CHV and the Royal DutchShell Group RD In total JetA estimates its backers represent of the global jet fuel market According to oil traders jet fuel is one of the most generic of oil products and as such is easier to trade through an electronic system than oil products with a greater variety of specifications such as gasoline or fuel oil Unlike most other online oil trading systems JetAcom is designed for physical trade in the form of buy and sell tenders with a facility for direct onetoone negotiation rather than derivative trade The web site however provides links to derivative trading sites as well as other physical trading sites As well as tenders airlines will also be able to make spot purchases from a variety of suppliers around the clock JetA has agreed to team up with Platts PlattsDirect system along with businesstobusiness management software company TradeCapturecom to provide its online electronic cash exchange Platts is a division of McGrawHill Cos MHP JetA estimates that of worldwide jet fuel transactions are already based on Platts price assessments and qualified trades from the JetAcom PlattsDirect system will be used in Platts own market assessments according to a JetA press release The Chicagobased site was formed Jan It also provides a data collection point for ticketing information and will maintain fuel contract and price databases Further services are expected to be launched in JetA says its site should save the airline industry up to million annually in fuel procurement costs Weak euro may be what the doctor ordered ECB WATCH Financial Times May By TONY BARBER Slower economic growth rising inflation and a tumbling euro make an unpleasant combination for the European Central Bank Each factor seems to reinforce the others As Ernst Welteke Bundesbank president observed last Friday the euros weakness has contributed to the eurozones problem with inflation over the past year Higher than acceptable inflation reduces the ECBs scope for cutting interest rates This in turn restricts economic growth especially in Germany Pessimism about the growth outlook then causes currency markets to sell the euro and the vicious circle is complete Is there any way out In the short term probably not One nasty blow for the euro was the revision this month of the widely followed Morgan Stanley Capital International equity market indices The resulting adjustments by portfolio managers could cause even more money to flow out of the euro and into other currencies than was first thought Paul Meggyesi of Deutsche Bank estimates the net outflow will be about Dollars bn higher than his initial calculation of Dollars bnDollars bn However the main beneficiary is likely to be not the dollar but sterling which Mr Meggyesi thinks will receive an inflow of Dollars bn Any further strengthening of the pound against the euro will provide food for thought for those in the eurozone as much as in the UK who are contemplating British adoption of the single currency Be that as it may it is uncertain that the ECB would accept the vicious circle diagnosis set out above The ECB is only in a bind if its objective is to cut interest rates rather than to do what it can for the economy without prejudicing its inflation objective says Nigel Anderson of the Royal Bank of Scotland This point becomes clear when one recalls that since the euros birth the ECB has always argued that real interest rates in the eurozone have been low by historical standards The ECBs main interest rate stood at per cent between April and November Coupled with oil priceinduced inflation and the falling euro the overall effect was to create a monetary policy setting that was very lax for many eurozone member states This explains the seven rate increases between November and October that took the ECBs main rate up to per cent The mild cut that the ECB finally delivered on May bringing the main rate to per cent ended up being less mild than the ECB intended Because financial markets did not like the ECBs reasoning behind the cut it triggered a fall in the euro that may ease overall monetary conditions by more than the cut itself The euros weakness does make it harder for the ECB to bring down inflation below its target ceiling of per cent a year But it also represents a monetary easing that as Mr Anderson suggests might be just what the doctor ordered for the eurozone Market suspicions that the ECB may be thinking of intervention in support of the euro may therefore be overdone For sure disorderly market conditions sometimes prompt central bank intervention But the euros latest decline has taken place in an orderly fashion It is a better tonic for the eurozone economy than a sharp rise in the currency If the ECB thinks otherwise it is up to the banks senior members to say so Central bank chief resists calls for advance distribution of euro notes Financial Times May By Peter Norman Wim Duisenberg president of the European Central Bank yesterday insisted that the changeover to euro notes and coins on January next year would be a success rejecting pleas for small denomination euro notes to be distributed to the public in advance He told the European Parliaments Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that the banks general council does not intend to change its decisions on socalled frontloading to the public at this late stage in the changeover timetable Disputing claims that all retailers wanted such a measure he pointed out that the advance distribution of euro notes to the public would upset the existing logistical plans for the changeover It would also be expensive for individuals because they would have to pay for the euro notes in national currencies yet not be able to use them before January Some retail groups especially in the Netherlands have warned of chaos on Euros day as consumers struggle to get used to the new currency and have insufficient paper money But Mr Duisenberg said the difficulties would be eased by the planned conversion of automatic teller machines to euros in the early hours of January and their loading with Euros and Euros notes He also said banks planned to open on that day in some eurozone countries while consumers should also have benefited from information campaigns that would provide details of the new notes to every household in advance The challenges with regard to the cash changeover should not be underestimated the ECB president said At the same time I am not aware of any indications that could place the effectiveness of the careful and comprehensive preparations for a smooth and successful cash changeover in doubt In a wide ranging question and answer session Mr Duisenberg also defended the ECBs recent rate reduction of per cent as consistent with the eurozones harmonised inflation rate falling below per cent next year from a rate of per cent in April declared it was not the banks policy to surprise financial markets as the last rate cut did But if the choice was between surprise or delay of a monetary policy decision he would accept surprise reaffirmed that intervention was a weapon available for use on foreign exchange markets However Mr Duisenberg stressed that the ECB would worry about the euro exchange rate only if it were to have a sizeable impact on inflationary expectations urged governments not to delay fiscal consolidation and to bring their budgets in line with the medium term goal of the EUs stability and growth pact of being close to balance or surplus Fed Chairman Warns Economic Slowdown Is Not Yet Over Further Cuts May Be Needed BNA May Further interest rate cuts may be needed in order to spur adequate economic growth but the underlying potential for the economy remains strong Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in a May speech to the Economic Club of New York The period of subpar economic growth is not yet over and we are not free of the risk that economic weakness will be greater than currently anticipated requiring further policy response Greenspan said Greenspan added however that the Federal Open Market Committees decision to cut the Federal funds rate by percentage points over the last five months are frontloaded policy actions that should be providing substantial support for a strengthening of economic activity later this year The Fed chairman warned that new investment in capital equipment is continuing to slow despite evidence that the expected rates of return on such equipment remain high Greenspan said however that he still believes we are experiencing only a pause in investment for innovations that have spurred the strongest productivity growth in more than years Greenspan also dismissed concerns that the risks of rising inflation were beginning to overshadow the slowing economy The lack of pricing power reported overwhelmingly by business people underscores an absence of inflationary zest Undoubtedly businesses are felling the effects of diminished pressures in product markets With energy inflation probably peaking and the easing of tightness in labor markets expected to damp wage increases prices seem likely to be contained Greenspan said He added that although some private sector economists have noted concerns that the rising yields for longterm Treasury notes may be signaling that the markets are worried about inflation the increase probably reflects some expectation that the decline in the supplies of outstanding marketable Treasury debt may not be as dramatic as earlier thought Responding to a question following his speech Greenspan said the Fed is not in a position to assess the likely impact of the trillion tax cut bill on FOMC policy We would observe how it affects the economy and then respond to the economy Greenspan said The tax cut bill that passed the Senate on May would provide for billion in immediate tax relief over the next two years but discussions are continuing in a HouseSenate conference committee to decide whether the money should be distributed through rebate checks changes in employer withholding or not at all Three Areas of Contention Threaten To Derail EU Effort at Economic Reform BNA May By Joe Kirwin BRUSSELSDespite several summits and numerous declarations dedicated to European Union economic reform the process launched more than a year ago in Lisbon by EU leaders to make the member states more competitive visavis the United States has hit a rocky patch in the month of May that threatens to derail a number of key initiatives Foremost among the Lisbon reform initiatives experiencing trouble is an electricity liberalization initiative Confounding that effort is a major feud between the French and Italian governments which developed because Frances stateowned national utility EdF bought a controlling stake in Italian stateowned utility Montedison Not only has the issue threatened new economic reform plans such as electricity market deregulation but it has even imperiled a fundamental EU single market tenet concerning the free movement of capital The latter is threatened due to emergency legislation passed May by Italy blocking foreign companies from purchasing Italian stateowned companies Another initiative pinpointed in Lisbon as well as in Stockholm in March at a followup economic reform summit but now facing gridlock and possible defeat is a new fasttrack approach to pass financial service legislation The other legislative initiative in trouble is a corporate takeover directive that collapsed because of disputes between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament Electricity Deregulation Issue The source of the conflict in the EU electricity deregulation issue revolves around the French governments refusal to deregulate its own electricity market while EdF is out buying up utility companies in other member states that have deregulated Even though EU leaders focused on this problem in Stockholm and called on the Commission to address the unfair situation EdF has continued on a buying spree Montedison was its most recent purchase Initially the French utility announced May its purchase of Montedison was only as a minority shareholder The Commission subsequently announced that the matter was therefore not of its concern However EdF was forced to announce May that it had in fact upped its stake and bought a controlling share in Montedison The Italian government outraged by the blatant double standard pursued by the French government and stateowned utility passed a law blocking the purchase by a foreign company of an Italian stateowned firm Commission Spokesman Andrea Dahmen stated May that the EU executive body would scrutinize the Italian legislation We will go through it carefully and see if it is in contradiction or not with existing EU law Dahmen said Existing EU law in this case is the free movement of capital Power Struggle Over Financial Services In the case of proposals for fasttrack financial service legislation based on a plan known as the Lamfalussy process the Commission and the European Parliament are in the throes of a power struggle The thrust of the Lamfulussy process is a plan that would by pass the normal EU legislative process that includes passage of legislation through the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament which usually takes at least two years That time span is considered much too long to keep up with fastmoving financial markets Instead the Lamfulussy process calls for a framework law to be passed through the normal legislative procedure but would also allow for regulations to be passed in a short period of time by two special committees However the European Parliament wants to have a recall or veto on the regulations approved by the special committees The Commission and Council of Ministers concerned that this would set a precedent for the future have rejected the EPs demand As a result the EPs Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee Chairwoman Christa RandzioPlath said May the framework law that would put the Lamfulussy process in place will be blocked If there is no agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission the Lamfalussy approach will not work said RandzioPlath There will be just the Parliament and the codecision procedure We support the goal of speeding up securities market regulation and will continue to work for a deal fully safeguarding the Parliaments rights under the codecision procedure Despite RandzioPlaths threats Internal Market Commission Frits Bolkestein said the EU executive body would move ahead and propose the framework legislation and supporting directives in June I am confident that a solution can be found Bolkestein said May But it will be impossible to give the Parliament the callback right it is seeking Corporate Takeover Directive The dispute over the corporate takeover directive is just as difficult At stake is a directive that has been in negotiation for more than years The central point of dispute concerns conditions that would allow for a hostile takeover of a company to proceed if shareholders give the goahead The EU member states finally approved the directive earlier this year that would allow for a hostile takeover But the EP is insisting that a companys board of directors be allowed a socalled poison pill that would allow them to defy shareholders and ward off a hostile takeover Led by German MEP Klaus HeinerLehne the EP is concerned that without the poison pill European companies will be easy prey for US corporate raiders The EPs cause received a major boost in the past month when German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder announced his government was backing away from its support for the Council of Ministerapproved bill Sweden which holds the EU rotating presidency rejected Germanys attempt to reopen the Council of Minister version of the corporate takeover directive However the German announcement has strengthened the EPs hand in Conciliation Committee negotiations which have been underway for more than two months If there is no agreement by June the Conciliation Committee process expires and so does the directive Therefore the Commission would have to start from scratch with a new proposal I think the chances of failure are now or percent said Lehne I have heard the Council of Minister decision They do not want to discuss defensive measures This is dictatorship of the Council Nothing more nothing less Commission Spokesman Jonathan Todd said if no agreement were reached on the corporate takeover directive it would be the EPs fault If they dont agree to the compromises the proposal will go in the bin said Todd We will have to reflect on whether to start over again In the meantime EU industry will pay the price with the harm done to the Lisbon process of restructuring and

May By Colin Cameron and Deborah Hargreaves Leading European and US banks want more information on how new rules on capital adequacy will operate raising the possibility that final proposals from the Basle committee could be delayed In a letter to William McDonough chairman of the Basle committee of international financial regulators banks yesterday asked for more detailed information on seven key areas The letter was signed by heads of the US European and Japanese banking associations We are keen to implement the new accord in but we see no absolute reason why the endoftheyear timetable has to be kept said Maurizio Sella president of the European Banking Federation Its much better to get out a proposal thats right even if it is a few months late The committee published its latest draft of the proposed Basle accord in January and set a deadline for consultation with the industry to be completed by the end of May But many financial operators believe this is now unrealistic The banking associations are asking for detailed papers to be sent to them by August so that they could respond by October The Basle committee has bitten off more than it can chew said Ian Linnell banking analyst at credit rating agency Fitch The accord in its draft form is incredibly aggressive and a contains a number of black holes that require further work Banks want detailed papers on the treatment of retail equity and project finance portfolios They are also asking for more information on the way operational risk unexpected losses will be treated and for details on aspects of securitisation counterparty risk and disclosure The letter points out that in a number of important areas the Basle committees second consultation document has either come up with new proposals or indicated that final proposals are to come Taken together these greener areas will have a critical impact on the outcome of the proposals for individual firms and the industry as a whole the letter says The banks are particularly concerned about the levels of capital that would have to be carried by some institutions to cover operational risk The misapplication of the operational risk charge could cause serious distortions in competition between institutions Mr Sella said They are also worried about the calculation of the level of capital banks must hold which in an economic downturn could lead to a credit crunch We have been assured the level of capital in the system will not increase We are very concerned that if the calibration is not done properly that will go up and it could have a serious effect on the economy the European banking federation said The Basle committee last night welcomed the banks feedback but expressed confidence that the yearend timetable would be maintained KfW seeks Basle II changes IFR May Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau KfW Germanys largest promotional bank intends to bring four items into the discussion surrounding the revised Basle Capital Accord Basle II Hans Reich the agencys managing board chairman said that modifications were necessary to ensure the supply of credit to small and mediumsized enterprises in the future In particular KfW wants the customary collateral categories to be recognised equally and fully in all risk rating approaches It also wants Basle II to allow small loans such as those to small businesses to be combined into socalled retail portfolios in all ratings approaches Referring to the advanced IRB approach and the Basle II papers requirement of higher equity being held for loans with long maturity KfW considers this to be a discrimination against the customary longterm lending relations that are long established in the German banking system KfW also considers the Basle II proposals on the subject of securitisation to be unclear It argues that care needs to be taken to ensure that the new requirements do not run counter to those of SME loans securitisation which reduce the risk for banks Reich expressed satisfaction at his firms intensive and constructive talks with the German finance ministry on these points We are pleased that our politicians are dealing so intensively with the topic of SME finance and the necessary changes required by Basle II he said Creditors Must Better Measure Hedge Fund Exposures BIS Dow Jones May By Tyler Lifton NEW YORK Dow Jones While good progress is being made towards strengthening the counterparty credit risk management and regulatory oversight of highly leveraged institutions HLI credit providers need to make further improvements in the measurement of credit exposures a global banking watchdog said Friday Disclosure of information by HLIs to banks and other credit providers has improved in terms of both quality and quantity nonetheless progress remains inconsistent with confidentiality concerns and competitive pressures sometimes limiting information flows according to a press release from the Bank For International Settlements HLI is a description generally reserved for hedge funds and other investment vehicles that use leverage or borrowing as a fundamental strategic tool The press release outlined a report by the Financial Stability Forum which works to promote international financial stability and is affiliated with the Basel Switzerlandbased BIS on progress made toward implementing recommendations it has endorsed Supervisors remain concerned about the ability of regulated firms to resist market pressures in particular on initial margin according to the release Although a separate study that looks to set out a basis for improvements in public disclosure of financial risks has been completed actual progress toward introducing mandatory public disclosure requirements for HLIs and hedge funds has been limited the FSF report said At the same time improvements have been made by senior management in terms of reporting on HLI exposures general standards of credit analysis due diligence and documentation the FSF reported And foreign exchange market participants have agreed to a set of socalled Good Practice Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Trading This would help address concerns that large and concentrated HLI positions could have the potential to materially influence market dynamics in small and mediumsized open economies according to the FSF report While progress is being made in addressing weaknesses in legal documentation practices it has proven difficult to achieve improvements in the consistency where appropriate between different industry standards the report added Legal

counterparty credit risk management and regulatory oversight of socalled highly leveraged institutions HLIs credit providers need to make further improvements in the measurement of credit exposures

hedge funds and other investment vehicles that use leverage or borrowing as a fundamental strategic tool BIS outlined a report by the Financial Stability Forum which works to promote international financial stability on progress made in the area Supervisors remain concerned about the ability of regulated firms to resist market pressures in particular on initial margin BIS said Banks say bill too tough on disclosure South China Morning Post May By Enoch Yiu Nine investment banks have voiced opposition to the proposed Securities and Futures Bill saying the proposals for derivative trading disclosure are tougher than elsewhere in the world They have asked the Government to amend the bill to exclude disclosure on some derivatives and ensure the disclosure regime reflected more closely the existing laws in Hong Kong and other markets The banks said they feared the legislation would discourage international investors from trading in Hong Kong shares undermining the SARs position as an international market The investment banks involved are Credit Suisse First Boston Deutsche Bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein Goldman Sachs Asia J P Morgan Merrill Lynch Asia Pacific Morgan Stanley Asia Salomon Smith Barney Hong Kong and UBS Warburg They are concerned about disclosure on socalled cashsettled derivatives Under existing law the banks need make no disclosure However they will need to do so under the new law as it expands the disclosure requirement from shares to include derivatives In a paper submitted by their law firm Linklaters to legislators yesterday the group of banks warned the bill would impose a stricter disclosure regulation on the local financial market than on those of overseas competitors But the Government rejected this saying the smaller local market would require tougher restrictions to avoid market manipulation The Governments refusal to make changes could endanger the implementation of the bill It has already been delayed from July to the yearend because legislators feared a rush to pass the bill would repeat the mess of the copyright law The Securities and Futures Bill when it becomes law replaces all existing securities ordinance and adds new regulations on Internet trading It will also tighten securities business in banks and make insider dealing a criminal offence The banks said the main reason the bill was tougher than those of its overseas competitors was that it required anyone to disclose interests in shares which had not yet been issued referring to newly issued shares held if options were exercised Also it required disclosure of their interests in listed companies arising under cashsettled derivatives In addition it required banks to report on short positions However the government refused to make any alterations Locally listed companies are smaller than their overseas counterparts making it easier for them to be manipulated by speculators said Au Kingchi Deputy Secretary for Financial Services The stricter disclosure requirement in the bill compared with international practices would be needed for Hong Kong to reduce manipulation activities she said Ms Au said the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce supported the bill to require disclosure in the derivative markets The government will not just hear the opinions of the large investment banks but we also need to listen to the ideas of the listed companies and the local investors who have demanded more transparency The Pan Asian Securities Lending Association a group of companies which conduct stock lending and borrowing activities also complained that the bill was too tough Its concern is that the bill is drafted too widely resulting in lender agents being required to make the disclosure None of the other global financial markets that have a formal securities lending market treat securities lending as a disclosable event the association said in a paper given to legislators yesterday US bankruptcy bill aids derivatives Risk May By Alexandra Ness A US bankruptcy bill now in the last stages of congressional approval contains crossproduct netting provisions that should enhance the legal status of credit equity and weather derivatives The hill updates the USs yearold netting laws which have been outstripped by the rapid development of new types of overthecounter derivatives markets Updating the netting provisions to include a wider range of OTC products has been a priority for the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and the Bond Market Association BMA since the mids In two highprofile reports in by the Presidents Working Group one on LongTerm Capital Management and one on OTC derivatives regulation US regulators acknowledged that updating the netting law would reduce systemic risk Even so Congress and the Bush administration do not see quick passage of the bill as particularly urgent and observers estimate it may take until the third quarter for it to become law Crossnetting or mutual offset of obligations and liabilities is standard for many transactions including swaps under current US law The definition of swaps has been stretched to cover forward rate agreements forward foreign exchange contracts and other instruments But the current law does not include equity and credit derivative contracts in its definition of swaps They fall under the nebulous term other similar agreements in the code The current crossnetting provisions for derivatives were passed under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act FDICJA in and are reflected in ISDAs master agreements Since the passage of the FDICIA legislation the derivatives market has grown significantly Friction developed between the swaps and securities contracts with regard to netting across them says Dan Cunningham a partner at Allen Overy in New York and ISDAs legal counsel ISDA and the BMA have worked on this issue since Nearly all the provisions requested by them have been included in the legislation The House of Representatives and Senate versions of the bill are currently being reconciled and there is little doubt that the netting provisions will be included in the bill eventually sent to President Bush for his signature Among these provisions is the expanded definition of a swap agreement At present swap agreements do not encompass any security agreements credit enhancements guarantees or reimbursement obligations related to swap agreements By eliminating the nonspecific phrase other similar agreements and expanding the definition of swap agreements to include equity credit and weather derivatives the new provisions allow for nearly all swap related securities contracts to have the right of transfer and setoff Currently security arrangements not specifically defined as swap agreements are rejected as unqualified transfers and not netted This bill will provide substantial legal certainties regarding securities lending and will promote liquidity says Seth Grosshandler partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen Hamilton an adviser to the BMA in bankruptcy legislation Contracts will have expanded collateral and an array of products to provide for safe harbour Netting and settlement will be much faster and more efficient under the new bill he adds One area the new hill does not address his crossaffiliate netting All provisions in the bill pertain to bilateral netting Provisions for crossaffiliate netting were deemed too complex to be included The I BMA is expected to propose an addition to the bankruptcy provisions to deal with crossaffiliate netting in the third or fourth I quarter of this year U Securities Trade Groups Argue Against Firms Liability To Sophisticated Investors for Certain Trades BNA May The Bond Market Association Futures Industry Association and Foreign Exchange Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York told the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit May that sophisticated investors should not be permitted to sue financial institutions for carrying out their nondiscretionary transactions in the credit markets BMA said that day de Kwiatkowski v Bear Stearns Co d Cir No In an amicus curiae brief the groups urged that allowing such suits would only lead to a heads I win tails I sue liability framework that would undermine the integrity and efficiency of the financial markets BMA said in a news release This is a critically important case for the fixedincome industry BMA General Counsel Paul Saltzman said in the release If the appeals court upholds the legal reasoning underlying the district courts decision counterparties will want juries to second guess every good faith action of financial institutions and seek reimbursement for every losing trade he predicted The organizations sought the overturn of a decision rendered late last year in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York Henryk deKwiatkowski a wealthy Canadian investor had engaged in a series of currency futures contracts and currency forward contracts that were purchased on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the overthecounter markets The contracts were carried out by Bear Stearns Co as a futures commission merchant FCM and as principal BMA recounted Responsibility With Customer The district court decided that special circumstances supported a jury verdict for Kwiatkowski and against Bear Stearns However the brief argued that the responsibility for trading decisions in nondiscretionary accounts rests with the customer and precluded liability in this instance for Bear Stearns Customers who suffer market losses should not be able to effect an end run around the carefully defined limitations on the duties of a broker by alleging violations of some general duty of care the groups wrote The three groups contended that because a wide range of factors can affect the market price of a futures contract the imposition of any continuing duty to furnish all price information and information of all facts likely to affect the market price would be so burdensome as to be unreasonable In this case they said deKwiatkowskis financial losses were brought about by market factors De Kwiatkowski speculated that the dollar would appreciateand he would have profited handsomely if it hadbut the Mexican debt crisis intervened the dollar fell and he incurred losses the brief said Those are the only special circumstances of this caseyet they are precisely the sort of circumstances that participants face in these markets day in and day out it said Reliance on Contracts Because of the need for legal certainty the credit markets must rely heavily on contracts to permit market intermediaries and their customers and counterparties to identify the precise nature of the products services or functions being purchased the brief observed Market participants need to be able to expect that other participants will be held to their contractual allocations of risk for the markets to perform effectively and efficiently especially in the futures and OTC derivatives markets where risk of loss inheres in every trade the three organizations urged The absence of certainty introduces risk which can hurt market efficiency liquidity and costs By disregarding precedents and New York law the district courts opinion runs counter to the legal certainty the markets require the brief said The district court in effect created a broad new malpractice cause of action against brokers regarding the handling of accountswhich is plainly at odds with New York law the brief maintained The narrow scope of a brokers duty to a nondiscretionary account under New York law applies fully to a futures broker the groups wrote Under longstanding legal precedent the duty owed by a futures broker to a nondiscretionary account is an exceedingly narrow one relating to properly carrying out transactions ordered by the customer the brief noted Dealers have similarly narrow responsibilities it argued Market intermediaries may agree to perform additional services such as discretionary trading and investment advisory services but in the absence of an explicit agreement the risk of the venture is upon the customer who profits if it succeeds and loses if it fails the brief summed up The limits of ingenuity Financial Times May Is the pace of financial innovation slowing To pose the question when global financial markets appear trapped in a perpetual maelstrom may seem quixotic Yet the markets in swaps options futures and other derivative instruments that emerged from the economic upheavals of the s are now relatively mature Innovative dynamism is less evident That fact in no way belies the radical nature of the changes of the past quartercentury The balance of the global financial system has tilted away from conventional tasks raising capital and matching the needs of savers and borrowers towards the management of risk According to Alfred Steinherr chief economist of the European Investment Bank the impact bears comparison with the creation of stock exchanges in previous centuries Some even argue that this financial revolution will become selfsustaining generating constant improvements in economic efficiency But what will drive that innovation in future The late Merton Miller Nobel Prize winner and supporter of derivatives markets emphasised the facilitating role of new technology and the desire to mitigate the costs of regulation and taxation That was certainly the pattern in the immediate postwar period Development in the s of the eurodollar deposit market arose from the regulatory ceiling on interest rates imposed on US commercial banks The eurobond market was a response to a new withholding tax on interest payments to overseas investors in dollar bonds Yet the explosive growth of derivatives markets from the s was driven by something more akin to deregulation The collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system shifted the task of managing currency volatility from the public to the private sector The resulting huge demand for insurance against fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates was met by swaps forwards futures options and so forth Computing and telecommunications power developments in financial theory such as the BlackScholes option pricing formula and the profitmaximising instincts of bankers and traders did the rest Instruments originally used for hedging in commodity markets became a largescale financial phenomenon That said regulation did encourage important innovations in the s and s that shifted financial business from one part of the system to another Increased capital requirements encouraged banks to push business offbalancesheet via derivatives trading and securitisation of loans Hence the phenomenal growth of the mortgagebacked securities market alongside the derivatives markets A measure of the transformation can be seen in the market value of outstanding overthecounter derivatives which are growing at the expense of exchangetraded derivatives At the start of outstanding OTC derivatives amounted to bn according to the Bank for International Settlements or just over half the value of all outstanding international debt securities That is up from bn in June but down from bn at the end of when aftershocks from the Asian crisis the Russian default and the nearcollapse of the LongTerm Capital Management LTCM hedge fund increased the need for hedges against volatility The picture is one of unspectacular growth And as Professor Richard Brealey of London Business School points out the academic worlds contribution in this area though still prolific has become less productive in terms of innovation So it seems we are close to a hiatus in developing new markets while new products no longer proliferate at the same pace Could there be a limit to the efficiency gains that can be wrung from the global financial system through innovation Robert Merton the Nobel laureate has argued that growing familiarity with the use of derivatives and their capacity to reduce transaction costs will continue to underpin a rapid pace of innovation Certainly there is scope for diffusion of derivatives around the worlds less efficient markets Existing trends such as the transfer of business from banks to the markets will says LBSs Prof Brealey continue Newer instruments such as credit derivatives are growing fast although central bankers worry about their robustness in a downturn Yet transaction costs remain stubbornly high in some markets where there is an obvious job to be done witness the thinness of the market in longterm swaps Moreover there is a paradox in the way risk management acts on the efficiency of the system Before the growth in derivatives the cushion against unforeseen losses was equity capital It was a useful if often expensive protection against all kinds of risk Hedging with derivatives removes the need for an allpurpose cushion because it targets specific risks The implication ought to be that this is an efficient and cheap substitute for equity Yet partly because bank supervisors remain sceptical about banks ability to control risks with derivatives bank capital has in fact increased over the past decade at the regulators behest So capital is probably being used less efficiently in the financial system in spite of innovation A more fundamental critique of hedging comes from Daniel BenAmi who argues in a new book that the systemic tilt towards risk management is both a consequence of and an encouragement to excessive risk aversion The argument is provocative coming so soon after the technology stock bubble But it coincides with the hedge funds retreating from big betting investment banks withdrawing capital from marketmaking and a dearth of stabilising speculation in currency markets A more plausible case can nonetheless be made that increased riskaversion is happening mainly in central banks The speed and complexity of derivatives trading have completely outstripped their supervisory capability This has fuelled a tendency among central bankers to see every financial tremor as a systemic threat that calls for lastresort lending or in the case of LTCM for broking a bank rescue Meanwhile the enthusiasm with which financial institutions have shoveled assets and liabilities off the balance sheet suggests a robust appetite for risk in the face of unwelcome regulatory constraints That appetite may have been enhanced by moral hazard whereby the existence of a safety net the central bank lender of last resort encourages less prudent behaviour Either way there will always be scope for increasing efficiency in the financial system More difficult is to forecast new customer demands of the kind that arose after the end of Bretton Woods One might be the shift of social security and pension arrangements from the public to the private sector But this is a slow burn affair not an explosion While portfolio regulations for private pensions will encourage regulatory arbitrage via derivatives the scope for innovation is less obvious than in responding to floating exchange rates and financial liberalisation In retail financial markets innovation has to cope with less sophisticated users It also operates more slowly Maybe private individuals will hedge more in future against reduced earnings unemployment or fluctuations in mortgage outgoings But politics militates against a big bang removal of the state safety net Perhaps the most interesting potential lies in a reversion from pure financial hedging to tradeable insurance against realworld uncertainty The fledgling weather derivatives market for example holds promise But only a visceral optimist could assume that financial innovation will continue at the pace of the past quartercentury The coincidence of market liberalisation advances in computing and new financial theory in the s has had a truly explosive impact But it is by the same token the kind of rare historical event that does not repeat itself in a hurry Airlines and food and beverage firms targeted IFR May As a true commodity weather derivatives still have a long way to go But power and weather derivative officials at FOWs third annual Derivatives Expo last week were encouraged by the new breed of endusers they expect to see using weather derivatives particularly airlines food and beverage firms agriculturalfertiliser firms and construction firms Airlines especially those concentrated in a particular hub could use weather derivatives more actively since inclement weather can prompt many more delays than they are used to notes Claudio Ribeiro head of new products development weather risk management group Enron Food and beverage firms are also viewed as prime targets that could use weather derivatives to manage their cashflows better These companies are in need of hedges since weather can increase or decrease a firms sales dramatically Food and beverage firms typically benefit from warm weather but on occasion a food chain for example can enjoy increased sales in cold spells if the weather is extreme enough to keep customers indoors More firms are beginning to ask questions such as If theres going to be a really hot summer how does that affect my bottomline What is my systematic weather risk going to cost this summer adds Cameron Rookley financial economist at Caminus Use of weather derivatives by agricultural sector companies is also a logical step according to people in the industry especially to hedge a guaranteed sale Though no underlying market exists power and weather derivatives providers have pinned their hopes on the growth of this market in the supply and demand for derivatives No one can buy a sunny day What you can buy is just the cost of the risk associated with that sunny day says Ribeiro The way to do that is by entering into swaps and options with limits The transactions are capped to reduce aggregate exposure up to USm The structures are mostly seasonal and feature multiyear terms Weather hasnt presented itself todate to be sufficiently fungible for us to build a broad market on yet its a pretty big market nonetheless adds Robert Levin senior vicepresident planning and control development at the New York Mercantile Exchange Since September when the first weather derivatives trade occurred the market has experienced an estimated weather transactions worth more than USbn Much weather derivatives use is occurring in the natural gas propane and electricity markets Markets are currently made in heating degree days HDD cooling degree days CDD and variations such as collars forwards and swaps Through the OTC market we can create any kind of structure Ribeiro says One brake on faster growth of weather derivatives is the lack of historical data To compensate a realistic hourly weather simulation engine is needed that could replicate thousands of multiregional weather scenarios said Rookley Such a model could capture seasonal and hourly patterns for normal temperatures the extent to which temperatures deviate from their normal level and the speed at which temperatures tend to return to the norm It would also handle a correlation across weather station pairings UK building societies use of credit derivatives limited IFR May By Jean Haggerty The UK Treasurys legislation allowing building societies to use credit derivatives to protect assets against borrower default may fail to bring the societies into the credit derivatives market Initial hopes were that the Treasurys move a fortnight ago would prompt the societies to embrace synthetic securitisations and thus help fuel credit derivative market growth On closer examination those hopes seem to be fading It is unlikely to be a very big market There are few building societies remaining Also the assets suitable for synthetic securitisation are relatively small said Chris Carman a vicepresident within JP Morgans structured products group in London Building societies mortgage assets are predominantly owneroccupied residential mortgages and as such they have a capital weighting for Bank for International Settlement purposes This weighting means that they have to hold at least capital against the asset So as a synthetic securitisation would only take the capital weighting to A deal would produce limited capital savings Carman said It also means that unlike banks with a large proportion of weighted assets building societies have limited incentive to seek regulatory capital relief via the transaction said Simon Gleeson partner at solicitors Allen Overy in London As mutual societies they are also not under pressure to improve their return on equity he noted While some smaller building societies may be candidates for synthetic securitisations because they are cheaper and require less documentation than traditional securitisations others may not have concentrations large enough to warrant the use of synthetic securitisations The smaller building societies that may be viable candidates for synthetic securitisations may not be able to build the infrastructure required to otherwise actively trade credit derivatives noted Janet Tavakoli executive director and head of structuring and engineering for credit derivatives at WestLB in London Building societies would need to be securitising an asset pool of more than Em to warrant entering into the transaction because the cost of putting together these transactions is quite sizeable other industry officials said Regulatory barriers The Building Societies Commission BSC the industrys regulator last week sent letters to all UK building societies saying that only building societies deemed to have sophisticated treasury departments will be able to use credit derivatives products without asking for regulatory permission ahead of execution Only about of the societies fall into that category A building societys ability to use credit derivatives hinges on where it fits on a BSCcreated spectrum that assigns eligibility based on criteria such as sufficient experience in using derivatives and adequate systems to capture and handle credit derivatives business An institution ranked in the middle of the fivetier spectrum will have to apply and to make a strong case for why it should be able to use credit derivatives Building societies ranked in the last two categories will not be allowed to participate in the credit derivatives market Even those building societies that have large mortgage books may reject the idea of using synthetic securitisations said Nick Rice associate director at Royal Bank of Scotland in London The toptier building societies are better rated Therefore issuing vanilla debt is easier than doing synthetic securitisations he said The rapid growth of the credit derivatives market has been spurred by an increase in synthetic securitisations The British Bankers Association BBA last summer projected that the credit derivatives market would reach UStrn notional outstanding by In before synthetic securitisations were used as a method for mitigating risks the BBA estimated the credit derivatives market at roughly USbn Building societies are most likely to use synthetic securitisations in new product areas as a way to transfer out the risk related to a new product or for transferring the risk of higherweighted assets industry officials said Buytolet mortgages might prove to be an area that is ripe for synthetic securitisation as they are weighted in the UK said JP Morgans Carman Building societies could also look to synthetically securitise some of their commercial lending he added For this too they would need to hold regulatory capital he said The changes enabling building societies to use credit derivatives occurred because the BSCs regulatory jurisdiction over building societies is being transferred to the FSA in November When the new Basle Accord comes in building societies will be subject to the FSAs bank rules They will be forced to look at their credit risk management said Simon Firth partner and head of the derivatives practice at Linklaters in London Under the new Basle proposal building societies will have the option of using a capital weighting against residential mortgage assets or using an internal riskbased approach Mortgage guarantees According to some industry officials building societies current practice of using insurance to reduce borrower risk may turn out to be what prompts them to enter the credit derivatives market Theoretically credit derivatives could take the place of mortgage guarantees You could say Instead of getting an insurance policy each time someone takes out a loan why not do a portfolio trade said Firth Unlike credit derivatives mortgage guarantees carry an insurance premium tax It is unclear how the cost of using mortgage guarantees compares with credit derivatives however The ban on UK building societies use of credit derivatives dates back to the Building Societies Act and subsequent amendments to it that preceded the development of the credit derivatives market The societies have been able to use only interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives The order allowing them to use credit derivatives comes into force on July West coast blues Risk May It has been a good quarter for the big US energy trading firms Enron and Dynegy two of the largest posted exceptional firstquarter results last month buoyed by their wholesale energy trading businesses Enrons revenues increased by over the corresponding period of while Dynegys more than doubled But the news out of California the countrys largest electricity market and an area where Enron Dynegy and a host of other energy marketers are active is unremittingly bad California utilities and state agencies owe the energy trading firms billions of dollars and their credit is deteriorating fast Pacific Gas Electric PGE Californias largest utility filed for bankruptcy protection early last month and there are mounting concerns about the creditworthiness of Southern California Edison and even the state government the energy buyer of last resort California officials have yet to devise a way to extricate the regions utilities from the quagmire caused by its mids electricity market deregulation plan which disastrously combined retail price caps a prohibition on hedging and unlimited wholesale price exposure The energy marketers say the California crisis will have little effect on their results Jeff Skilling president and chief executive officer at Enron in Houston said in an April conference call held to discuss its firstquarter earnings that the California crisis had no material impact on earnings to date and would have no adverse impact for the rest of the year Dynegy officials in a conference call the same day echoed the sentiment saying they had sufficient reserves and expect to get paid every cent they are owed from Californias energy buyers Some observers are less sanguine The energy marketers say earnings are good but these big PLs profit and loss statements are not cash so much cash is being absorbed by collateral says JeanPaul St Germain principal consultant at Risk Capital Management RCM in New York And these firms are owed boatloads of money Most energy trading firms claim to have hedged their books against market risk But St Germain argues that their re cent performance indicates otherwise The high earnings the trading firms are reporting show that they take a strong view on the market These firms made a lot more money than expected that means theyre not hedging correctly St Germain says They werent gamma hedged he says Gamma will kill them if the market goes the other way The energy trading firms will not discuss the methods and extent of their market risk hedging But Skilling said that for each trade when it closes we have the position hedged Part of this is a function of Enrons own capacity We continue to develop new generating capacity which provides an inventory of future capacity sales and lowcost highvalue optionality in a highly volatile marketplace Skilling said The real danger for energy traders is not market risk but as PGEs bankruptcy illustrates counterparty credit risk This has focused the minds of traders on proper documentation collateral management termination provisions and related issues For credit and trading organisations it has always been a huge issue says Blake Herndon director of risk management at the Williams Companies in Tulsa Oklahoma The volatility has highlighted it throughout the industry he says Audit David Yeres a partner specialising in derivatives law at Clifford Chance Rogers Wells in New York says A number of our clients have asked us to do a contract audit in response to the scrutiny management is giving to these exposures and the adequacy of the documentation Mark Haedicke managing director and general counsel at Enron Capital and Trade Resources in Houston says It is the creditrelated provisions that are most important the termination provisions netting collateral thresholds He adds We work very hard at upgrading our contracts Were analysing our contracts in light of market changes and our experience in California Haedicke says there is currently a wide spectrum of contracts in use in California from very basic shortterm sale tariffs to very sophisticated master agreements The standard contract for California power trading is sponsored by the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC an industry group that monitors power generation and distribution in the western US This contract while widely used does not have stateoftheart termination and setoff netting provisions A new master agreement published last year by the Edison Electric Institute EEl a Washingtonbased electric industry group contains many cuttingedge provisions It has a structure similar to the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations master agreements Although it is not yet widely used in California it is gaining adherents We love the EEl master its an excellent form Haedicke says Prior to starting to use the EEl about nine months ago we had our own form which basically took all the financial trading provisions out of the ISDA master and put it into a power trading context Clifford Chances Yeres expects that I the California crisis will accelerate acceptance of moresophisticated master agreements Counterparties are eager to do business on a single counterparty to single counterparty basis governed by a master that allows netting he says The EEl master is designed so counterparties can adjust its provisions to suit their credit risk management policies There is a lot of optionality built into the master says Andy Katz director of industry legal affairs at the EEl For instance you can set up any kind of structure using collateral threshold amounts or guarantees or any type of credit support mechanism I know a lot of the suppliers have added quite a bit of additional language for transactions with the California Department of Water Resources CDIR the state agency that now purchases power on behalf of the utilities he says Concerns over the states own credit quality are affecting the CDWRs level of credit risk Some traders believe the WSCCs document is adequate as long as counterparties keep counterparty risk standards tight The WSCC has done well for us over the last five years says Kevin Fox senior vicepresident and general manager of the commodity service division at Aquila in Kansas City Fox says Aquilas main response to the California crisis has been to keep a close eye on its counterparty risk If we had a lot of positions with one counterparty we would put on countervailing positions to flatten it out he says Despite the conflicts between counterparties in the California energy market the EEl master has not itself been tested in court However the concepts contained in the EEl master that are similar to those in the ISDA master agreement which has stood the test of time and been proven in court ISDA itself has an initiative under way that when complete could benefit energy marketers operating in California It is looking at ways to expand its master agreement to cover both physical and financial transactions Haedicke who is an ISDA board member and chair of the energy and developing products committee looking into this says It would be a much more efficient world if we could find a way to use the ISDA master for both physically and financially settled transactions and find a way to net across physical and financial Collateral Collateral is another area being scrutinised in the wake of the California crisis The energy trading firms will not only look harder at creditworthiness but also more importantly they will reconsider their policies on collateral Clifford Chances Yeres says Traditionally energy firms have not been as collateral conscious he says but they are now becoming much more so An important part of this especially when price volatility is high is the need to tightenup marktomarket requirements for collateral Yeres says Counterparties are eager for more frequent and accurate marktomarket provisions and for terms that give the party with the net exposure the right to receive collateral promptly For contracts that are not written with adequate or even any collateral provisions there is still a way for counterparties to manage their credit risk if they have written their contracts under New York law Yeres says Under the concept of adequate assurances in New York law a party to a forward contract with reasonable grounds to be insecure about the ability of its counterparty to fulfill its responsibilities may demand performance assurance such as collateral If the demand is denied it may be able to terminate the contract Market participants say this is not standard practice although many contracts are written under New York law because the courts have a strong understanding of and long track record with derivatives litigation Termination and settlement provisions are also vital Depending on documentation some energy traders have been able to terminate and closeout transactions at an earlier stage than others using the socalled early termination events Yeres says These include crossdefault provisions not only with the counterpartys other credit agreements but also increasingly with the credit agreements of its affiliates Settlement provisions are also important If a party terminates a contract early for failure to deliver or some other reason the contract must specify how the compensation will be calculated From the early days of this market it has been apparent that the old terms like force majeure dont work unless there is a price attached RCMs St Germain says There is a debate over whether compensation should be based on a market quote or on liquidated damages This is a controversy typical of new markets participants in the bandwidth trading market are trying to reach a durable accord on the same topic Risk November page Generally the markets preference depends on liquidity Yeres says Where the market is not fully liquid and quotes are not reliable participants use liquidated damages A final area where contracts are being scrutinized in dispute resolution There is currently no consensus on this topic Different market participants reflect their institutional preferences For example financial institutions highly value the predictability of litigation while trading companies have been satisfied with arbitration which is faster Yeres says He predicts that as transaction sizes grow the trading companies will begin to value litigations predictability over arbitrations speed Strategies To survive the California crisis intact trading and power supply firms must have sound credit risk hedging strategies For example before PGEs bankruptcy Dynegy Reliant Energy Duke Energy and Mirant all set aside reserves against their exposure to the utility Calpine a San Jose California independent power producer did not and its stock has suffered since PGEs bankruptcy filing The utility owed Calpine million as of March Some energy marketers are rumoured to have sold short PGE and Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison in the second half of Others have sought protection in the credit derivatives market but default swap spreads on PGE and Edison widened rapidly last summer after the ex tent of the energy crisis became apparent and protection quickly became unavailable In either case there is substantial basis risk but the hedges should have provided some protection nonetheless Traders say that above all aggressive counterparty credit risk management is crucial In his earnings conference call Enrons Skilling said his firm calculates the credit quality of each of the more than counterparties in its portfolio At the end of the day we run our credit exposures against that and it kicks out what we need to reserve We have done this for a decade Our credit reserves are significant and totally a function of whats happening in the marketplace every day Aquilas Fox agrees Basically we have been setting our credit exposure limit to each counterparty based on the high prices we began to see last June Despite this many trading companies still have to endure long and uncertain workout processes Enron and other trading firms have been appointed to PGEs creditors committee The PGE bankruptcy process promises to be long and contentious not least because the company will find it hard to form a business plan until Californian politicians and regulators agree on a solution to its energy crisis The costs and opportunity costs of working through this debacle should ensure that the lessons of the California crisis are long remembered European settlement systems under fire Financial Times May By Vincent Boland Central securities depositories and futures exchanges need to cooperate on the recurring problem of unsuccessful transactions in the European securities markets according to the International Securities Markets Association ISMA said yesterday representatives of its European repo committee had held a frank and open discussion with CSDs to address the issue of settlement failures transactions where one or other party to a deal fails to settle its end of the bargain on time or at all While allowances would be made for the nature of the market a major factor contributing to the relatively high level of settlement failures in the European securities markets is the fragmentation of settlement systems the large number of clearing and settlement depositories and the different timeframes within which each custodian operates ISMA said these bodies needed to work together in a constructive way to provide a more harmonised security settlement environment in Europe to substantially reduce the number of failed transactions The organisations intervention will increase pressure on Europes different clearing and settlement systems to speed up cooperation so costs can also be reduced US banks and investors claim processing transactions in Europe costs up to seven times as much

proposed a rule that would allow such registrants to avoid the requirement that all FCMs be members of a registered futures association Though it is operating under a voluntary moratorium on new rules requested by the White House the CFTC has received permission from the Office of Management and Budget to propose rules that arose out of Congresss sweeping reform package known as the Commodity

a system migrates from the familiarity of badla to the complexities of derivatives trading But at the end of the day you have to see whether it is a pain worth taking To my mind this is certainly the case The Indian equities market has to move up to better products even if it means some shortterm adjustment pains Q Do you think volumes will dry up A Certainly not It will be fairly liquid and vibrant There may be a drop in volumes at the initial stage but in six to eight months I expect the markets to revive to their normal levels of activity Q The Sebi had introduced index futures in June last year What has been the experience so far A Ever since index futures were introduced in June last year there has been a slow but steady growth The trading volumes are growing every month Last July was better than June and so it continued In February the average daily trading was worth around Rs crore So it is very clear that the product index futures fills in some perceived need in the market for such a product Otherwise such products die a very quick death The increasing volumes also tell us that it is attracting new adherents by the day which means those who started early have stayed on and their experiences are helping new players to come into the market In that sense I am satisfied But mind you this is growth on a low base We still have a long way to go It has been the global experience that the derivatives markets take off slowly Typically you have to give it oneandahalf to two years to reach critical mass If the Indian markets do not show signs of growth in the next six to seven months after taking into account the one year in which index futures has been around then we have a problem In our case the experience is not terribly bad but certainly not as good as one would have expected Q What is the level of preparedness of the market participants A The stock exchanges are by and large prepared They have already been trading in index futures and hopefully their software and systems are in place Coming to brokers I think they have to make an effort to set their back offices and trading strategies in order But I am very optimistic that the brokers will respond to the new regime enthusiastically once they smell money in terms of trading opportunities Well it is a challenge since the margining system is much more complex and the methodology of computing margins is not a straight calculation In fact the challenge is in getting the margins right Q Do you think the ordinary investor will embrace the new system or will he be marginalised A I pin my highest hopes on the Indian investor who has shown a great capacity to learn Everyone is on the learning curve but once the average investor realises the benefits of the new system he is sure to take the plunge Q The big question remains earlier you were a badla supporter why have you changed your stance A Laughs Well yes I was a strong badla supporter when badla was banned in In fact I was among the few who protested the badla ban then My point was simple how can you take away whatever rudimentary instruments investors have to hedge themselves against risk And if you have a theoretical problem with badla you must have a better system to replace it with In we didnt have an alternative I had written a paper in where I argued that badla was meeting a whole lot of requirements in the system For instance if you remember that was the time when all shares were in paper form So if a guy had sent shares for transfer which often took two months or more then he couldnt sell in the interim period Badla gave him the opportunity to exit by selling first and postponing delivery till such time as he got the shares to deliver Badla was a hedging mechanism that doubled up as a tool for speculation It was the only way to have short sales in the system which is the ultimate bulwark against the bullish price manipulation of shares And it was the only means of getting finance into the equity markets So there were three or four very obvious functions that badla was doing If you look at the scenario now demat has removed the issue of delays in getting shares transferredso on the stock lending scheme has replaced badla as the preferred option to get shares to make deliveries in case of short sales Badla has lost its relevance now Q But do derivatives fill in all the market requirements A Please understand that there are lots of specific products that have been introduced in the system over the last decade that fulfill each of these requirements individually So instead of a complex system which served all purposes in a suboptimal manner now we have an array of specialised products that deliver specific services and do it better In derivatives we have a world class hedging tool now available to Indian investors Q You said that globally the derivatives markets take two years to develop fully How much time do you give yourself for the Indian derivatives market to reach critical mass A I would give it six to nine months By early I expect average daily volumes of Rs crore Q What will be the role of banks in the new system A Of course banks will continue to be the fulcrum of the new system too We will need to have clearing banks that settle the cash part of the transactions Plus there will be a whole new vista of opportunities for banks in the derivatives markets For instance banks can do calendar spreads as yet another method of parking their surplus funds and earning returns Calendar spreads are nothing but simple contracts where banks buy an option for a near period say June and sell it for a longer period say September It is like a forwardtoforward contract in the foreign exchange markets and banks can get positive returns In the long run this can be a huge market like the overnight call money market where banks can park their shortterm funds Q Do you think financing will be an issue in the markets when badla financiers are thrown out of the new system A It is not true that badla financiers will be removed from the system It is just their methods of operations will change They can arbitrage between the cash market and derivatives markets and even within the derivatives market By deploying their funds between different parts of the market they will not only impart depth to the markets but will also make a decent return on their funds Q The way you put it is the system going to be a level playing field for foreign institutional investor mutual funds and large players In the badla system these players for instance were prohibited from short selling A I think it is a level playing field for everyone though I have received some queries whether FIIs will also be allowed to short sell We are negotiating with RBI Q What is the issue with FIIs A There is no issue It is just that the RBI had mandated that FIIs can only buy derivative contracts to hedge against an underlying position So if an FII had a purchase position in the spot market it could short sell in futures but not a naked short sale Maybe there is a policy issue somewhere but we are in dialogue with the central bank and hope to resolve the issue Tax dues mar brokers foray into derivatives Business Standard May By Aniek Paul The Securities and Exchange Board of India Sebi has decided that the brokers seeking fresh registration for the derivatives segment will have to first clear their turnover tax dues to the market regulator Brokers are upset with the decision and feel that this would deter the growth of the derivatives market as the tax would mean an additional burden on them and substantially reduce the interest in the segment which needs to grow fast According to rough estimates the aggregate dues of the broking firms to Sebi as outstanding tax on turnover is about Rs crore The amount due from individual brokers varies from few lakh to several crores The brokers had moved court disputing the Sebis claim but they lost their case in the Supreme Court in February this year after a protracted legal battle In addition to the dues to be cleared brokers would have to pay the standard registration fee which even for a trading member is about Rs lakh and for the software Sebi has also mandated that all broking firms seeking registration for the derivative segment must have at least two experts in derivatives trading with a NCFM NSE Certification for Financial Markets certificate Sebi full time board member Jayanth R Varma said It is untenable that the brokers will be offered registration for a new segment without clearing their dues Besides when the apex court has upheld Sebis claims the brokers cannot get away without paying it Speaking on the various nuances of the derivatives segment Varma said in the beginning the derivatives segment would be cashsettled implying that the difference between the strike price and reigning market price would be paid to the gainer and securities would not be delivered We will follow the American model in individual stock options and the European model in index options Varma said In the American model one can exercise the option at any point during the entire life of the option while in the European model the right to exercise the option is restricted within a specific time frame Varma also said it would take the market regulator a couple of meetings to finetune the risk management system for the segment Varma added in the next board meetings Sebi would discuss whether smaller exchanges like Calcutta Stock Exchange would be allowed to start their own derivatives segment New attack on proposal to allow advertising by hedge funds Financial Times May By JOHN AUTHERS The Investment Company Institute the trade association for the US mutual fund industry started its annual meeting in Washington yesterday with a renewed attack on proposals to allow hedge funds to advertise Matthew Fink the institutes president said hedge fund advertising could create serious and unnecessary risks to public confidence in the industry Hedge funds should accept greater regulation if they wanted to open themselves to the general public he said If parallel industries are permitted to develop one regulated one unregulated the only direction we are destined to move in is a race to the bottom as competitive forces pressure all firms to minimise regulatory costs The Managed Funds Association which represents hedge funds wants relaxation of the rules against advertising but says it does not want to compete for retail investors The institute also took the opportunity to respond to the widespread belief that mutual fund flows make the market more volatile This followed an outflow of Dollars bn from equity mutual funds in March the highest monthly outflow on record This appears to have been followed by a heavy inflow in April Terry Glenn chairman of Merrill Lynch funds and chairman of the Institute denied there was any sign of panic from mutual fund investors during the early months of this year Panic is not a word one would associate with our investors Shareholders are not insensitive to stock price movements but their response to market movements tends to be spread over time Mr Glenn added that fund investors have never responded to sharp market falls by redeeming shares en masse in any period since the war There is no evidence that this longestablished pattern of behaviour will change he said End of ISDA Press Report for May THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF ISDAS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND
