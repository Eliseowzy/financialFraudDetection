<9249105.1075846662826.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mbaldwin@igservice.com,2000-05-12 07:14:00,Potential Rebuttal Testimony Socal OIR Cc Susan Per your request I have outlined potential rebuttal testimony points for your consideration I recommend that we minimize our testimony to distinct points without extensive elaboration whenever possible andor coordinate our ideas into Socal sponsored testimony Kern Rebuttal Transwestern desires to clarify Kerns request modification to the Comprehensive Settlement into two parts Kern is not correct in its allegation that new or expanded interconnections have only secondary rights in order to discourage new pipeline interconnections with Socal Gas On the contrary the Settlement parties envisioned that future market conditions may warrant such new supply interconnects and nothing in the Comprehensive Settlement denies such interconnections from occurring Specifically Transwestern and other parties simply did not want any such new interconnects disrupting existing shippers primary firm rights A benefit during the entire settlement period is that holders of Socal backbone capacity have stability and certainty for their backbone capacity entitlements On the second part of Kerns request to modify the Comprehensive Settlement by allowing new supply interconnections primary firm receipt capacity where such new interconnections do not degrade existing delivery capacity at the existing Socal Gas receipt points the Comprehensive Settlement does not prohibit such an outcome The Settlement parties simply envision that this matter and any other pertinent interconnection issues would be negotiated between Socal and the new interconnection counter party or would be determined in a separate Commission Application PGE I think we need to play this problem as we have been through private off line discussions If the Indicated Producer Group members can get comfortable then we will find the right means to modify the Comprehensive Agreement Post Interim Settlement PIS P The PIS correctly observes that there have been serious concerns with respect to Socal Gas windowing procedures but incorrectly characterizes the adoption of primarysecondary receipt point protocol outlined in the Comprehensive Settlement as a resort to extreme measures Transwestern has operated its own FERC pipeline system under such a protocol with great success and customer satisfaction The primarysecondary protocol is a proven workable solution The PIS receipt point protocol is an modified windowing procedure which does not offer a long term solution to receipt point access on the Socal system P YAP The PIS proponents suggest it may be possible to put a system of capacity rights into practice Transwestern agrees that it is possible and in fact the Comprehensive Settlement does in fact accomplish the possible While Transwestern agrees that customers are currently benefiting from competitively priced gas at the interstateintrastate Socal border we see no evidence that the unbundling of Socals backbone system will reduce the competitive environment at the Socal border In fact the PIS consistently fails to recognize the creation of an additional Socal competitive trading point the Socal citygate All customers will have increase trading opportunities not less P The PIS proponents suggest that a bottleneck situation could occur at the Socal citygate Transwestern simply disagrees The full mmfcd a day of existing interstate capacity is available to supply the citygate market Most importantly in addition to these supplies the entirety of Socal storage withdrawal capacity over Bcfd also trades at the Citygate point on the Socal system In view of potential new storage development in Socalthis Citygate capacity could even increase So rather than a bottleneck situation at the Citygate Socal customers would reasonably expect to enjoy even greater capacities than currently available at the Socal border P The PIS proponents simply are incorrect that marketers could increase prices by withholding backbone capacity during alleged constrain periods SoCal and the parties assured that Socal has the full opportunity to sell either operational available firm capacity or interruptible capacity at anytime If a firm backbone capacity holder is not utilizing their full capacity entitlements Socal can sell interruptible services P The problem identified by the PIS testimony where generators do not receive confirmation of their electric bid award from the PX until after the first gas nomination cycle is manageable under the Comprehensive Settlement primarysecondary protocol Firm primary receipt point capacity holders have full use of their backbone capacity through the first nomination cycles That is to say generators can bid competitively into the PX market and be absolutely certain that their Socal primary access and backbone transmission service capacities will be available to them These certainties do not exist under the current or contemplated windowing procedure The Comprehensive Settlement offers a real long term improvement for generators

Subject I EPNG Revisions To SoCalGas Draft Exh re Pipeline Capacity Attached is an email containing revisions and additions El Paso recommends be made to SoCalGas draft Exhibit which was distributed for further comment to parties on June This email has two attachments The first attachment is a revised copy of SoCalGas table titled Firm Pipeline Capacity into Southern California with changes to a correct the amount of firm interstate capacity on El Paso at Topock shown in the col Incoming Interstate Capacity by replacing the incorrect figure MMcfd which includes capacity for delivery to SW Gas which is not available to California on a firm basis with the correct figure MMcfd b delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from the col Total Takeaway Capacity since this capacity is not firm capacity available to California c adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols affected by these changes d add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El Paso have existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to SoCalGas totaling MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas takeaway capacity at Topock and clearly creates a mismatch and c add reference in footnote to the physical capacity of KernMojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas at Wheeler Ridge South which is in excess of MMcfd even though the metering is currently set to MMcfd The second attachment contains two schematics intended to supplement SoCalGas draft map of receipt points and interconnections These schematics more accurately reflect the actual physical interconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurate impression that the interconnect with El Paso at Topock consists of several separate pipelines with no cross over and that inaccurate impression that several interconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road El Paso understands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses to Administrative Law Judge Birens request for a late filed exhibit concerning mismatches and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGas receipt points In the spirit of compromise El Paso will not oppose SoCalGas filing an exhibit

<12505006.1075846687547.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mbaldwin@igservice.com,2000-05-12 07:14:00,Potential Rebuttal Testimony Socal OIR Cc Susan Per your request I have outlined potential rebuttal testimony points for your consideration I recommend that we minimize our testimony to distinct points without extensive elaboration whenever possible andor coordinate our ideas into Socal sponsored testimony Kern Rebuttal Transwestern desires to clarify Kerns request modification to the Comprehensive Settlement into two parts Kern is not correct in its allegation that new or expanded interconnections have only secondary rights in order to discourage new pipeline interconnections with Socal Gas On the contrary the Settlement parties envisioned that future market conditions may warrant such new supply interconnects and nothing in the Comprehensive Settlement denies such interconnections from occurring Specifically Transwestern and other parties simply did not want any such new interconnects disrupting existing shippers primary firm rights A benefit during the entire settlement period is that holders of Socal backbone capacity have stability and certainty for their backbone capacity entitlements On the second part of Kerns request to modify the Comprehensive Settlement by allowing new supply interconnections primary firm receipt capacity where such new interconnections do not degrade existing delivery capacity at the existing Socal Gas receipt points the Comprehensive Settlement does not prohibit such an outcome The Settlement parties simply envision that this matter and any other pertinent interconnection issues would be negotiated between Socal and the new interconnection counter party or would be determined in a separate Commission Application PGE I think we need to play this problem as we have been through private off line discussions If the Indicated Producer Group members can get comfortable then we will find the right means to modify the Comprehensive Agreement Post Interim Settlement PIS P The PIS correctly observes that there have been serious concerns with respect to Socal Gas windowing procedures but incorrectly characterizes the adoption of primarysecondary receipt point protocol outlined in the Comprehensive Settlement as a resort to extreme measures Transwestern has operated its own FERC pipeline system under such a protocol with great success and customer satisfaction The primarysecondary protocol is a proven workable solution The PIS receipt point protocol is an modified windowing procedure which does not offer a long term solution to receipt point access on the Socal system P YAP The PIS proponents suggest it may be possible to put a system of capacity rights into practice Transwestern agrees that it is possible and in fact the Comprehensive Settlement does in fact accomplish the possible While Transwestern agrees that customers are currently benefiting from competitively priced gas at the interstateintrastate Socal border we see no evidence that the unbundling of Socals backbone system will reduce the competitive environment at the Socal border In fact the PIS consistently fails to recognize the creation of an additional Socal competitive trading point the Socal citygate All customers will have increase trading opportunities not less P The PIS proponents suggest that a bottleneck situation could occur at the Socal citygate Transwestern simply disagrees The full mmfcd a day of existing interstate capacity is available to supply the citygate market Most importantly in addition to these supplies the entirety of Socal storage withdrawal capacity over Bcfd also trades at the Citygate point on the Socal system In view of potential new storage development in Socalthis Citygate capacity could even increase So rather than a bottleneck situation at the Citygate Socal customers would reasonably expect to enjoy even greater capacities than currently available at the Socal border P The PIS proponents simply are incorrect that marketers could increase prices by withholding backbone capacity during alleged constrain periods SoCal and the parties assured that Socal has the full opportunity to sell either operational available firm capacity or interruptible capacity at anytime If a firm backbone capacity holder is not utilizing their full capacity entitlements Socal can sell interruptible services P The problem identified by the PIS testimony where generators do not receive confirmation of their electric bid award from the PX until after the first gas nomination cycle is manageable under the Comprehensive Settlement primarysecondary protocol Firm primary receipt point capacity holders have full use of their backbone capacity through the first nomination cycles That is to say generators can bid competitively into the PX market and be absolutely certain that their Socal primary access and backbone transmission service capacities will be available to them These certainties do not exist under the current or contemplated windowing procedure The Comprehensive Settlement offers a real long term improvement for generators

Subject I EPNG Revisions To SoCalGas Draft Exh re Pipeline Capacity Attached is an email containing revisions and additions El Paso recommends be made to SoCalGas draft Exhibit which was distributed for further comment to parties on June This email has two attachments The first attachment is a revised copy of SoCalGas table titled Firm Pipeline Capacity into Southern California with changes to a correct the amount of firm interstate capacity on El Paso at Topock shown in the col Incoming Interstate Capacity by replacing the incorrect figure MMcfd which includes capacity for delivery to SW Gas which is not available to California on a firm basis with the correct figure MMcfd b delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from the col Total Takeaway Capacity since this capacity is not firm capacity available to California c adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols affected by these changes d add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El Paso have existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to SoCalGas totaling MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas takeaway capacity at Topock and clearly creates a mismatch and c add reference in footnote to the physical capacity of KernMojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas at Wheeler Ridge South which is in excess of MMcfd even though the metering is currently set to MMcfd The second attachment contains two schematics intended to supplement SoCalGas draft map of receipt points and interconnections These schematics more accurately reflect the actual physical interconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurate impression that the interconnect with El Paso at Topock consists of several separate pipelines with no cross over and that inaccurate impression that several interconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road El Paso understands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses to Administrative Law Judge Birens request for a late filed exhibit concerning mismatches and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGas receipt points In the spirit of compromise El Paso will not oppose SoCalGas filing an exhibit

Subject I EPNG Revisions To SoCalGas Draft Exh re Pipeline Capacity Attached is an email containing revisions and additions El Paso recommends be made to SoCalGas draft Exhibit which was distributed for further comment to parties on June This email has two attachments The first attachment is a revised copy of SoCalGas table titled Firm Pipeline Capacity into Southern California with changes to a correct the amount of firm interstate capacity on El Paso at Topock shown in the col Incoming Interstate Capacity by replacing the incorrect figure MMcfd which includes capacity for delivery to SW Gas which is not available to California on a firm basis with the correct figure MMcfd b delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from the col Total Takeaway Capacity since this capacity is not firm capacity available to California c adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols affected by these changes d add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El Paso have existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to SoCalGas totaling MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas takeaway capacity at Topock and clearly creates a mismatch and c add reference in footnote to the physical capacity of KernMojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas at Wheeler Ridge South which is in excess of MMcfd even though the metering is currently set to MMcfd The second attachment contains two schematics intended to supplement SoCalGas draft map of receipt points and interconnections These schematics more accurately reflect the actual physical interconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurate impression that the interconnect with El Paso at Topock consists of several separate pipelines with no cross over and that inaccurate impression that several interconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road El Paso understands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses to Administrative Law Judge Birens request for a late filed exhibit concerning mismatches and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGas receipt points In the spirit of compromise El Paso will not oppose SoCalGas filing an exhibit

<31827156.1075846707025.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mbaldwin@igservice.com,2000-05-12 07:14:00,Potential Rebuttal Testimony Socal OIR Cc Susan Per your request I have outlined potential rebuttal testimony points for your consideration I recommend that we minimize our testimony to distinct points without extensive elaboration whenever possible andor coordinate our ideas into Socal sponsored testimony Kern Rebuttal Transwestern desires to clarify Kerns request modification to the Comprehensive Settlement into two parts Kern is not correct in its allegation that new or expanded interconnections have only secondary rights in order to discourage new pipeline interconnections with Socal Gas On the contrary the Settlement parties envisioned that future market conditions may warrant such new supply interconnects and nothing in the Comprehensive Settlement denies such interconnections from occurring Specifically Transwestern and other parties simply did not want any such new interconnects disrupting existing shippers primary firm rights A benefit during the entire settlement period is that holders of Socal backbone capacity have stability and certainty for their backbone capacity entitlements On the second part of Kerns request to modify the Comprehensive Settlement by allowing new supply interconnections primary firm receipt capacity where such new interconnections do not degrade existing delivery capacity at the existing Socal Gas receipt points the Comprehensive Settlement does not prohibit such an outcome The Settlement parties simply envision that this matter and any other pertinent interconnection issues would be negotiated between Socal and the new interconnection counter party or would be determined in a separate Commission Application PGE I think we need to play this problem as we have been through private off line discussions If the Indicated Producer Group members can get comfortable then we will find the right means to modify the Comprehensive Agreement Post Interim Settlement PIS P The PIS correctly observes that there have been serious concerns with respect to Socal Gas windowing procedures but incorrectly characterizes the adoption of primarysecondary receipt point protocol outlined in the Comprehensive Settlement as a resort to extreme measures Transwestern has operated its own FERC pipeline system under such a protocol with great success and customer satisfaction The primarysecondary protocol is a proven workable solution The PIS receipt point protocol is an modified windowing procedure which does not offer a long term solution to receipt point access on the Socal system P YAP The PIS proponents suggest it may be possible to put a system of capacity rights into practice Transwestern agrees that it is possible and in fact the Comprehensive Settlement does in fact accomplish the possible While Transwestern agrees that customers are currently benefiting from competitively priced gas at the interstateintrastate Socal border we see no evidence that the unbundling of Socals backbone system will reduce the competitive environment at the Socal border In fact the PIS consistently fails to recognize the creation of an additional Socal competitive trading point the Socal citygate All customers will have increase trading opportunities not less P The PIS proponents suggest that a bottleneck situation could occur at the Socal citygate Transwestern simply disagrees The full mmfcd a day of existing interstate capacity is available to supply the citygate market Most importantly in addition to these supplies the entirety of Socal storage withdrawal capacity over Bcfd also trades at the Citygate point on the Socal system In view of potential new storage development in Socalthis Citygate capacity could even increase So rather than a bottleneck situation at the Citygate Socal customers would reasonably expect to enjoy even greater capacities than currently available at the Socal border P The PIS proponents simply are incorrect that marketers could increase prices by withholding backbone capacity during alleged constrain periods SoCal and the parties assured that Socal has the full opportunity to sell either operational available firm capacity or interruptible capacity at anytime If a firm backbone capacity holder is not utilizing their full capacity entitlements Socal can sell interruptible services P The problem identified by the PIS testimony where generators do not receive confirmation of their electric bid award from the PX until after the first gas nomination cycle is manageable under the Comprehensive Settlement primarysecondary protocol Firm primary receipt point capacity holders have full use of their backbone capacity through the first nomination cycles That is to say generators can bid competitively into the PX market and be absolutely certain that their Socal primary access and backbone transmission service capacities will be available to them These certainties do not exist under the current or contemplated windowing procedure The Comprehensive Settlement offers a real long term improvement for generators
