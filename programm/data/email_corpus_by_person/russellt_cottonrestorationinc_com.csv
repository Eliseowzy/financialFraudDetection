David King Rodney Pedraza has gotten wa Oh sure hes still a gaijin an imported player in the insulated world of Japanese baseball But as he starts his third season with the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks of the Pacific League the Cuero High School graduate and former University of Texas pitcher has earned the respect of his peers and developed a mutual respect The players know how the system works how we could be here one year and gone the next said Pedraza noting that most nonJapanese players dont stay with teams more than a season or two Its hard for them to open up to us knowing that but since this is my third year most have opened up to me It doesnt hurt that Pedraza who never climbed above the TripleA level in North America has become the top closer in Japan In he had saves Last year he had tying a Pacific League record and earned the Fireman Award as the leagues top reliever Pedraza had been a starter throughout his pro career but the Hawks needed a middle reliever when he joined them early in the season One night a pitcher was hit by a line drive and he wound up throwing the final three innings for a save They asked me if I could close and I said I would give it a shot he said I told them I didnt have closer stuff but I would go after guys and throw strikes Its worked so far The combination of a sinking fastball a slider and amazing control he walked four and struck out last season has made him almost automatic for the Hawks who have gone from the leagues doormats to contenders the past two seasons The Hawks managed by Sadaharu Oh Japans homerun champion won their first Japan Series in years in It was kind of overwhelming for me because it was my first year I made the AllStar team I was being successful at something I hadnt done since college and as a team we were in the middle of a pennant race Pedraza said It was over before I could really get a grasp on what was going on He got the final strikeout of the Japan Seriesclinching game against the Nippon Ham Fighters But he admits he was a little puzzled by the postgame celebration which included the players tossing Oh in the air multiple times a march around the field with the championship pennant and a solemn ceremony in the clubhouse The adjustment to Japanese culture on and off the field can be overwhelming for a lot of players as Whiting wrote in his book But Pedraza went to Japan prepared to be flexible He got his opportunity through Lee Tunnell who pitched three seasons in Japan Tunnell was his pitching coach at the Rangers Class A team in Port Charlotte Fla in and he recommended Pedraza to scout Shin Mizumori the next spring Knowing he wasnt going to get beyond the TripleA level with the Rangers Pedraza at the time signed with Mizumori He sat down with Tunnell and Mizumori before leaving and got a full briefing They told me to have an open mind and go have fun Pedraza said The culture is very different but it doesnt affect me that much Ive gotten used to most of it or at least the things that mean anything to me One problem has been the language Although he has a translator Pedraza said he misses the camaraderie with his teammates some of whom speak no English There are some neat guys that Im missing out on only because I cant speak to them he said Id like to know about them and what they are thinking and I cant ask he said We try to talk and just end up smiling at each other and walking away His main contact with the Englishspeaking world is his laptop computer and the Internet Pedraza who is single talks to his mother virtually every day on the telephone as well She also visits occasionally Weve been to Japan his first two years Its a completely different world over there said his mother Imogene Stakes Pedraza also takes advantage of his brief offseason teams that make the playoffs dont finish their seasons until the end of October and spring training starts Feb Thats not much of an offseason because thats the time I have to spend getting ready for the following year said Pedraza who recently bought a home and property near Cuero I have to squeeze that in along with my hunting and fishing Its not easy but right now he wouldnt trade his life I
