<13886639.1075863696162.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,david.port@enron.com,2000-06-12 06:35:00,Re UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors om hit Cc hear about this one I have some observations to make from my reading and rereading of the account It looks like the old undue influence problem again It seems some attempts were made by operations to follow up but nothing happened We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we dont have any way to protect them if they do there is still the fear that if they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career And that is because twice a year at the PRC that can happen This incident shows some of these attributes For the operations process to be effective there has to be and be seen to be little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of the operations staff Whoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm the basis on which they signed it Why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers Brokerage is in the PL and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage is at the agreed rate they should simply pay the brokerage Two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable it should be done same day I would not have waited for the traders to do it but I would want to know why it took them so long Given that these short trades were absent from the portfolio during a highly volatile period of rising prices I would wonder about motivation in addressing the position during this time Essentially if it had been correct we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did I would pursue explanations to points and DP Fernley CT AM To James CT cc Richard CT Mike CT Robert CT Gail CT Ian CT Steve W CT David PortMarket NRON Brent A CT Subject Re UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors om hit James Thanks for the note As described this is an intolerable situation I agree your action points but we need timelines and quantitative measures of complianceimprovement please could you provide a weekly update on this area specifically and until we are satisfied that things are as they should be On a more general note lets ensure that the Global Standards address the lapses in timely actionfollowup identified here so that we can monitor performance across the business Fernley James New To Richard CT Fernley CT Mike CT cc Robert CT Gail CT Ian CT Subject UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors om hit On the th of June Gas Risk Management became aware that twolate trades had been entered into the gas traders Blue book which were both being booked significantly late and had a material negative PL impact negative om The late deals were done on the rd of February Marcello Romano and the th of March Haakon Olafson and were both forward starting sells for periods in Background Input errors For some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal input errors that have been occurring in the Gas area with the most significant number coming form the UK Gas traders Numerous errors have been found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness of entering deals into the blue book the Gas traders are currently the only traders in Europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation system there is currently a big push to change this which has the support of John Sherriff with a deadline date of July In the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen A log of all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of May which highlights an error rate of of non EOL trades This has been discussed with Richard Lewis and corrective action is expected Deal booking and reconciliation process Non EOL trades Deals are initially written into the blue book by the gas traders when the deal is done This book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are the manually input into GasDesk by documentation on the same day Faxed broker statements are received usually by documentation the next day and these are reconciled to GasDesk with errors and amendments made by documentation liasing with the traders as necessary At this time brokers were faxing one statement per trade relevant later New Deal sign off As part of the daily DPR process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and the implied origination PL For the rd of February Marcello signed off the new deals sheet and for the th of March Jonathan Whitehead signed off Documentation convention In the gas market the convention is that the seller sends deal documentation relevant later Documentation aim to get this out within one the day after trade booking Brokerage invoices Brokerage invoices are usually received monthly by settlements who then reconcile the trades on the invoice to the valuation system to ensure the deal is valid before passing the reconciled invoice to the traders to authorise for payment Any deals which cannot be found are raised with documentation who then investigate and follow up with the traders Specific details of these late trades Summary For both these trades no evidence can be found of receiving or can it be established that we did not receive a broker statement which is a primary control in agreeing the existence and accuracy of new OTC deals As Enron was the seller in both cases no documentation was received from either counterparty which would have alerted us to the trade The reconciliation of the brokerage invoices was carried out by settlements in April and was completed by the th with the invoices falling due for payment on the th The work practice at that time was that brokerage invoices including those with non reconciling trade queries were batched together and passed to the traders This would have taken place on the th of April Details on exactly what was said and done in the weeks between passing these invoices to the traders for approval although there are claims that verbal follow up were made on a number of occasions and when a mailed follow up was made on the nd of May are hazy What is clear is that on the nd of May Morgan Stanley contacted Enron to try to confirm their position which was when it was realised that an error could well have occurred Over the next two weeks tapes were then checked by the traders with the deals being booked on the th of June Deal specifics EES Broker Morgan Stanley trade on Feb Trader Marcello EES Invoice date March Invoice received before March as settlements started checking it Keren Perrott settlements started on March Discrepancies sent to documentation on May Chris Ware to Emma Thomson Traders contacted on May after copy of broker confirm was sent on May as requested by documentation to prove deal Deal entered June after traders checked the tapes IEB Broker NP trade on Mar Trader Haakon IEB invoice date April Invoice received before April as settlements started checking it Keren Perrott Discrepancies sent to documentation on May Chris Ware to Robert Vaughn Traders contacted on May after copy of broker confirm was requested Deal entered June after traders checked the tapes Who was at fault and where did the control break down I do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that can be made and drawn Firstly there are major concerns over the Gas traders accuracy and prioritisation of booking trades Despite numerous conversations on the subject very little improvement has been seen It has now got to the stage where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the error was and who made it This is now being communicated to Richard Lewis every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time trade support spend correcting errors and re running DPRs but also to try to avoid the incidence of errors such as this The current error rate is of non EOL trades Documentation currently estimate that in times out of the broker or counterparty are correct Secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived Most brokers have now changed but one or two still send one statement per trade Reconciliations of these daily statements to GasDesk are evidenced Thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow up more vigorously and by mail errors and omissions on a more timely basis There is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders This is causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment Action Points Trading Traders to input their own deals directly into GasDesk Traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking Traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis Trade Support Settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices Documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual deal statements All follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate Documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the broker records Documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree our forward position from July to September the traded part of the curve

<10994071.1075863692932.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,david.port@enron.com,2000-06-12 06:35:00,Re UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors om hit Cc hear about this one I have some observations to make from my reading and rereading of the account It looks like the old undue influence problem again It seems some attempts were made by operations to follow up but nothing happened We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we dont have any way to protect them if they do there is still the fear that if they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career And that is because twice a year at the PRC that can happen This incident shows some of these attributes For the operations process to be effective there has to be and be seen to be little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of the operations staff Whoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm the basis on which they signed it Why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers Brokerage is in the PL and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage is at the agreed rate they should simply pay the brokerage Two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable it should be done same day I would not have waited for the traders to do it but I would want to know why it took them so long Given that these short trades were absent from the portfolio during a highly volatile period of rising prices I would wonder about motivation in addressing the position during this time Essentially if it had been correct we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did I would pursue explanations to points and DP Fernley CT AM To James CT cc Richard CT Mike CT Robert CT Gail CT Ian CT Steve W CT David PortMarket

general note lets ensure that the Global Standards address the lapses in timely actionfollowup identified here so that we can monitor performance across the business Fernley James New To Richard CT Fernley CT Mike CT cc Robert CT Gail CT Ian CT Subject UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors om hit On the th of June Gas Risk Management became aware that twolate trades had been entered into the gas traders Blue book which were both being booked significantly late and had a material negative PL impact negative om The late deals were done on the rd of February Marcello Romano and the th of March Haakon Olafson and were both forward starting sells for periods in Background Input errors For some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal input errors that have been occurring in the Gas area with the most significant number coming form the UK Gas traders Numerous errors have been found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness of entering deals into the blue book the Gas traders are currently the only traders in Europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation system there is currently a big push to change this which has the support of John Sherriff with a deadline date of July In the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen A log of all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of May which highlights an error rate of of non EOL trades This has been discussed with Richard Lewis and corrective action is expected Deal booking and reconciliation process Non EOL trades Deals are initially written into the blue book by the gas traders when the deal is done This book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are the manually input into GasDesk by documentation on the same day Faxed broker statements are received usually by documentation the next day and these are reconciled to GasDesk with errors and amendments made by documentation liasing with the traders as necessary At this time brokers were faxing one statement per trade relevant later New Deal sign off As part of the daily DPR process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and the implied origination PL For the rd of February Marcello signed off the new deals sheet and for the th of March Jonathan Whitehead signed off Documentation convention In the gas market the convention is that the seller sends deal documentation relevant later Documentation aim to get this out within one the day after trade booking Brokerage invoices Brokerage invoices are usually received monthly by settlements who then reconcile the trades on the invoice to the valuation system to ensure the deal is valid before passing the reconciled invoice to the traders to authorise for payment Any deals which cannot be found are raised with documentation who then investigate and follow up with the traders Specific details of these late trades Summary For both these trades no evidence can be found of receiving or can it be established that we did not receive a broker statement which is a primary control in agreeing the existence and accuracy of new OTC deals As Enron was the seller in both cases no documentation was received from either counterparty which would have alerted us to the trade The reconciliation of the brokerage invoices was carried out by settlements in April and was completed by the th with the invoices falling due for payment on the th The work practice at that time was that brokerage invoices including those with non reconciling trade queries were batched together and passed to the traders This would have taken place on the th of April Details on exactly what was said and done in the weeks between passing these invoices to the traders for approval although there are claims that verbal follow up were made on a number of occasions and when a mailed follow up was made on the nd of May are hazy What is clear is that on the nd of May Morgan Stanley contacted Enron to try to confirm their position which was when it was realised that an error could well have occurred Over the next two weeks tapes were then checked by the traders with the deals being booked on the th of June Deal specifics EES Broker Morgan Stanley trade on Feb Trader Marcello EES Invoice date March Invoice received before March as settlements started checking it Keren Perrott settlements started on March Discrepancies sent to documentation on May Chris Ware to Emma Thomson Traders contacted on May after copy of broker confirm was sent on May as requested by documentation to prove deal Deal entered June after traders checked the tapes IEB Broker NP trade on Mar Trader Haakon IEB invoice date April Invoice received before April as settlements started checking it Keren Perrott Discrepancies sent to documentation on May Chris Ware to Robert Vaughn Traders contacted on May after copy of broker confirm was requested Deal entered June after traders checked the tapes Who was at fault and where did the control break down I do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that can be made and drawn Firstly there are major concerns over the Gas traders accuracy and prioritisation of booking trades Despite numerous conversations on the subject very little improvement has been seen It has now got to the stage where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the error was and who made it This is now being communicated to Richard Lewis every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time trade support spend correcting errors and re running DPRs but also to try to avoid the incidence of errors such as this The current error rate is of non EOL trades Documentation currently estimate that in times out of the broker or counterparty are correct Secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived Most brokers have now changed but one or two still send one statement per trade Reconciliations of these daily statements to GasDesk are evidenced Thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow up more vigorously and by mail errors and omissions on a more timely basis There is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders This is causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment Action Points Trading Traders to input their own deals directly into GasDesk Traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking Traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis Trade Support Settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices Documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual deal statements All follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate Documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the broker records Documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree our forward position from July to September the traded part of the curve

decide if CEO level lets change to say a certain multiple o f instead of and bIf at Board level dont we need to specify a time horizon If not w hy bother to specify the trigger if ones going to be at CEO discretion a nd consequently not specified in the policy itself why not all of it Definitions in excerpt below Rick Buy wants these definitions ha rd coded and clearly defined in the policy Future

Capacity I defined this by pulling terms straight from the slide in the Joint Au ditFinance Committee presentation do you agree who is going to calculate this daily and provide to RAC and by when Potential Future Cash Requirements is this clear enough any specific collateral assumptions given contra ctual cash posting optionality worst case assumption Does RAC really need to calculate this if GRMO is going to report it o n the Executive Report Viewer and the calculations are hardcoded above Seems like we could implement a process by which the pieces of informatio n get fed to GRMO to calculate and report like all the other market risk m etrics Please call me in the morning so I can run through any required changes Regards Cassandra Risk Measurement for LiquidityFunding Risk Liquidityfunding risk focuses on whether the Company is able to raise enou gh capital whether through debt equity or counterparty collateral to me et its cash and collateral requirements and is a function of funding liqui dity and position liquidity Margin deposits received and margin deposits required under the Companys Trading Portfolio have a significant impact on the Companys funding requirements and are often determined by changes in commodity prices Position liquidity refers to the extent to which a posi tion can be liquidated quickly and in large volume without substantially affecting the positions price Key determinants of the liquidity of a pos ition and the cost of liquidation include a the level of thirdparty int erest and market activity in the asset b the time period available to co nvert the asset to cash c the size value or volumes of the asset and d perception of the Company in the marketplace Active management of fun ding requirements and capital availability should minimize funding shortfal ls See Section for the limit structure and reporting guidelines The Liquidity Exposure Ratio Liquidity Ratio is the primary metric of t he Companys liquidityfunding risk to be implemented under a transition pe riod determined by the Risk Management Committee The Liquidity Ratio shal l be calculated daily over a specified time period by dividing a the sum of the Companys i Future Available Cash and ii Borrowing Capacity by b the Companys Potential Future Cash Requirements Future Available Cas h shall represent the Companys current cashflow forecast as determined by the Accounting department considering operating and investing activities Borrowing Capacity shall be determined by the Treasury department and sh all be calculated as the sum of a commercial paper b uncommitted bank lines and loan sales lines c letter of credit facilities d accounts receivable e shelf registrations for public debt issues and f shelf r egistrations for public equity issues Potential Future Cash Requirements shall be calculated by the Trading Portfolios risk systems and shall repre sent a simulation of margin exposure and collateral requirements for the Tr ading Portfolio Liquidity stress testing shall be performed periodically as determined by the Chief Risk Officer to quantify the liquidityfunding risks associated with specific positions Such stress testing may include specific asset li quidity stress tests to quantify the risks associated with illiquid positio ns Results of liquidity stress testing will be made available to the CEO and to other parties at the discretion of the Chief Risk Officer Capital Associated with LiquidityFunding Risk Liquidityfunding risk arises from the potential that funding requirements will exceed funding availability for a given time period Funding requirem ents may vary over time as a result of a exchange margin requirements c ollateral obligations and collateral receivables primarily related to Tradi ng Portfolio activities b new investments c the payment of interest a nd dividends and d the maturing of debt and other obligations Funding availability may vary over time as a result of a available cash b acc ess to capital markets c available collateral and d the time required to convert positions to cash or liquid assets The Company shall use the Liquidity Ratio liquidity stress testing and oth er methods as specified by the Chief Risk Officer to measure liquidityfund ing risk Limit Structure for LiquidityFunding Risk The CEO shall approve an advisory limit for liquidityfunding risk Liquid ity Ratio Advisory to be implemented under a transition period approved b y the Risk Management Committee This shall be based on the Liquidity Rati o discussed in Section of this Policy The Liquidity Ratio shall be ca lculated using two different assumptions to calculate Potential Future Cash Requirements the denominator of the calculation a a confidence lev el and b a confidence level AdministrationReporting for LiquidityFunding Risk The Liquidity Ratio shall be calculated on a daily basis and reported by GR MO to the CEO the Chief Risk Officer and the Treasury department designee If the Liquidity Ratio is a less than using a confidence level to calculate Potential Future Cash Requirements or b less than using a confidence level to calculate Potential Future Cash Requirements th e Chief Risk Officer shall notify the CEO and others at his discretion Th e CEO shall direct senior management to take certain actions to mitigate th e Companys liquidityfunding
