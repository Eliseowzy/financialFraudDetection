contract granting plaintiffs an option to purchase a subdivision from defendants because the conditions requiring receipt of all necessary governmental approvals and permits for development inured to the benefit of all parties This case was distinguishable from Brotman v Roelofs because here defendants could only receive payment if plaintiffs were successful i n disposing of the individual subdivision lots and the governmental permits were a necessary precondition to the sale of any lots in the eventual subdivision and therefore any payment to defendants Where as here all parties benefited from the conditions and there was a continuing relationsh ip after transfer Brotman was inapplicable Summary disposition for defendant s was affirmed because under the clear and unambiguous

Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Shirley eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Cavanagh Talbot and Meter The family court properly terminated respondentmothers parental rig hts and its findings on the statutory factors were not clearly erroneous The famil y court found that respondent failed to show sufficient consistency with her children she had made insufficient progress with her problems the childre n had serious problems that needed to be addressed and respondent often miss ed or was late for visitations with the children The family court also found that because

Published Case Name Stitt v Holland Abundant Life Fellowship eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Hoekstra Griffin and Bandstra Defense counsels repeated attempts to introduce evidence relating to the illumination of plaintiffs counsels parking lot despite the trial court s having ruled the evidence inadmissible did not warrant reversal of the tri al court judgment of no cause of action Although plaintiffs objected to each of the instances complained of on appeal all but one of those objections was sustained and no further relief was requested The court could not conclude that questions of counsel which were not answered constituted misconduct requiring reversal when plaintiffs neither requested that the jury be instructed that questions of counsel were not evidence nor requested a mistrial However the award of offer of judgment sanctions against plaintiffs was reversed under the interest of justice exception Unusual circumstances existed in this case because of the unsettled nature of the law which was changed or clarified during the course of appeals in thi s case and the gamesmanship that occurred by the offer of judgment defendant made after the mediation evaluation

the trial court erred in refusin g to default the defendant or prevent him from presenting a defense based on the failure to follow the requirement of o e that a defendant shall file an affidavit of meritorious defense Whether the defendants failure to file a n affidavit of meritorious defense deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction Court Michigan Court of Appeals Published Case Name Wilhelm v Mustafa eJournal Number Judges Collins Jansen and Zahra Defendants failure to timely file an affidavit of meritorious defens e did not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying plaintiffs motion seeking to sanction the defendant by entering a default or by precluding the defendant from presenting a defense Although the requirement that a defendant file a n affidavit of meritorious defense is mandatory the statute does not indicat e that default is the mandatory or even appropriate remedy where a defendan t fails to file the affidavit Plaintiff did not raise the issue of the defendants failure to file the affidavit until the first day of trial The trial court could have sanctioned both partiesdefendant for not filing th e affidavit of meritorious defense in a timely manner and plaintiff for not including her procedural defense in the final pretrial order A courts subject matter jurisdiction is determined only by reference to the allegations in the complaint It was apparent from the allegations in plaintiffs complaint that the negligence alleged was within the class of cases with regard to which a circuit court is empowered to act The trial court had jurisdiction and the defendants failure to timely file his affidavit did not affect the trial courts power to hear the case

of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Leske v Warren Dental Assocs PC eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Zahra Hood and McDonald Summary disposition in favor of defendantproperty owner was proper i n this premises liability case because the evidence indicated that the oil spot plaintiff slipped and fell on was of the nature of a condition commonly fou nd in ordinary parking lots Opting to allow it to naturally absorb into the asphalt was not an unreasonable response Defendant did not by unreasonabl e action or inaction create a dangerous condition in the parking lot To withstand defendants motion for summary disposition plaintiff had to establish that defendant had notice of the condition but plaintiff present ed no direct evidence indicating how or when the oil was spilled onto the parking lot The only evidence plaintiff offered to show that defendant kne w or should have known of the oil spot was her testimony that the oil was bla ck and had spread to a diameter of two and a half feet

barred claims o due process claim in connection with fiveday unpaid suspension Qualified immunity o Fir st Amendment claim Court US Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit Case Name Strouss v Michigan Dept of Corrections eJournal Number Judges Jones Cole and Nugent Plaintiff did not establish a prima facie case of retaliation becaus e she failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding a causal connection between her lateral transfer and her protected activity Plaintiff did establish the third element of a prima facie case of Title V II retaliation because there was at least a material issue of fact whether th e conditions of her lateral transfer which may have put her in contact with prisoners who had threatened her constituted an adverse employment action However there was clear and undisputed evidence that plaintiff was inform ed of the decision to transfer her months before she complained about a docto r s sexual comments and in light of defendants swift response to those complaints temporal proximity alone was insufficient to raise an inferenc e of a causal connection Dismissal of plaintiffs claims was affirmed Full Text Opinion Criminal Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Motions to quash the informations regarding the crime of rio t The constitutionality of the riot statute Court Michigan Court of Appeals Published Case Name People v Kim eJournal Number Judges Saad Holbrook Jr and McDonald Since the evidence established that the defendants acted in concert with others to engage in violent conduct which caused or created a serious risk of causing public terror and harm and there was ample evidence establishing probable cause that each defendant participated in the rush toward police and in throwing projectiles the district courts properly bound over defendants on the crime of riot and the circuit court erred in quashing t he informations The defendants claimed and the circuit court agreed that since the violent acts were directed at and witnessed by the police and because police officers are not members of the public the defendants acts did not cause public terror or alarm The court has observed that a defendant causes public terror or alarm any time a segment of the public i s put in fear of injury either to their persons or their property and concluded that the statute also applies to violent conduct that creates a serious risk of causing public alarm Reversed with the charges of riot reinstated and remanded Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Insufficient evidence to support conviction of felonyfirear m Remedy Admission of photograph and enlargement Other acts evidence Peop le v Sabin People v Engelman Harmless error Competency of sevenyear old to testify Prosecutors use of leading questions put to child witnesse s Right of confrontation and to crossexamination Prosecutorial misconduct Cumulative effect of prosecutorial misconduct Court Michigan Court of Appeals Published Case Name People v Watson eJournal Number Judges Meter Cavanagh and Talbot Defendants conviction for felonyfirearm in connection with CSC I was reversed and vacated because there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant penetrated the victim on that occasion However while the prosecutor could not retry defendant on that identical felonyfirearm charge retrial using the applicable predicate offense assault with intent to commit CSC II was permitted The trial court did n ot abuse its discretion in admitting a photograph of the victims buttocks because evidence that defendant carried the photograph in his wallet had probative value to show that the victims allegations were true and tha t he had a motive The trial court also did not err in finding that the victim s sevenyear old brother was competent to testify Reversal was not warrante d by various instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct Except for the felonyfirearm conviction and sentence defendants convictions and sentences were affirmed The case was remanded for a new trial on felonyfirearm Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Motion for rehearing or reconsideration of denial of motion to transfer prosecution of defendant from juvenile to adult status Discretionary transfer and mandatory transfer provisions of USC o Taylor v United States Court US District Court Eastern District of Michigan Case Name United States v AFF eJournal Number Judges Lawson The governments motion for rehearing or reconsideration of the c ourts decision denying the motion to transfer prosecution of defendant from juvenile to adult status was denied because the government failed to show a defect by which the court was misled or which upon correction would lead to a different result The governments argument that the mandatory tra nsfer provision of the statute applied to defendant was not raised in a proper o r timely fashion and in any event defendants prior conviction of seconddegree home invasion did not place him within the scope of that provision The court determined that defendants crime of seconddegree home invasion involving his breaking into a house with the intent to commit larceny did not contain an element of actual or threatened use of physica l force against the person of another and therefore was not a predicate offense for mandatory transfer Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Waiver of right to be present during voir dire Whether the re was a sufficient connection to interstate commerce to convict defendants of RICO violations and violence in furtherance of racketeering United States v Lopez Whether a de minimis connection to interstate commerce is sufficien t to convict Whether o violent crimes in aid of racketeering is controlled by Lopez Court US Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit Case Name United States v Riddle eJournal Number Judges Norris Guy and Siler A trial court is not required to engage a defendant in an ontherec ord colloquy before allowing the defendant to absent himself from voir dire and a failure to do so is not a fundamental structural error Therefore defendants waiver through their counsel of their right to be present duri ng voir dire was effective Defense counsel suggested defendants absence an d the district court allowed the waiver only after it instructed defense counsel to consult with their clients and then received assurance from defense counsel that defendants waived their right to be present Defendants absence was part of a defense strategy to avoid any prejudice resulting from the appearance of heavy security during the questioning of the potential jurors Even if the waiver were not effective the right to be present at voir dire is not one of those structural rights whose violation constitutes per

Jones Cole and Nugent Plaintiff did not establish a prima facie case of retaliation becaus e she failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding a causal connection between her lateral transfer and her protected activity Plaintiff did establish the third element of a prima facie case of Title V II retaliation because there was at least a material issue of fact whether th e conditions of her lateral transfer which may have put her in contact with prisoners who had threatened her constituted an adverse employment action However there was clear and undisputed evidence that plaintiff was inform ed of the decision to transfer her months before she complained about a docto r s sexual comments and in light of defendants swift response to those complaints temporal proximity

eJournal Number Judges Weaver Corrigan Taylor Young Jr and Markman Dissen t Kelly Dissent Cavanagh In an issue of first impression in any state court the court held t hat under the plain language of the ISTEA reciprocity agreements were irrelevant in determining what registration fees were charged or collected as of November Plaintiff alleged that defendants collected registration fees in excess of the amount allowed under ISTEA contending that Michigan could not alter its reciprocity agreements because these wer e frozen at their November levels The court declined to defer to t he ICCs interpretation banning states from charging registration fees in excess of preexisting reciprocal discounts The court determined that the plain meaning of the ISTEA was clear and applied the statute as written without reaching the agency interpretation The ISTEA itself referred only to the fees collected or charged and contained no reference to reciprocit y agreements The court concluded that it must look at the generic fee Michigan charged or collected from carriers as of November not a t the fees paid by plaintiff in any given year Reversed and remanded Justice Kelly dissenting disagreed with the conclusion that recipr ocity agreements were not relevant to determining the registration fees that Michigan charged and would have affirmed the decisions of the Court of Appeals and Court of Claims in favor of plaintiff Justice Cavanagh also dissenting likewise found the statutory lang uage ambiguous and that the ICC permissibly construed it in taking into account reciprocity agreements

Jr Not participating Markman The court struck down the Private Roads Act allowing a private land owner to petition a township supervisor to open a private road across another landowners property as providing for an unconstitutional taking under art o of the Michigan Constitution of because it authorizes a taking that primarily benefits a private rather than a public purpose Plaintiffs owned landlocked property and defendants owned a neighboring parcel Defendants refused plaintiffs requests seeking a paved road acros s their parcel and an easement for utility lines Plaintiffs sued requesting a writ of mandamus compelling the township supervisor to proceed under the act The trial court ruled against plaintiffs and the Court of Appeals fou nd error in the refusal to issue the writ The court concluded that since the act gives individuals a permanent and continuous right to pass over anothers property it allowed a permanent physical occupation of private property by means of government action and was a taking The taking authorized by the act appeared to merely be an attempt by a private entity to use the states powers to acquire what it could not get through arms length

eluding a police officer Alleged police brutality Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Buchanan eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Gage Cavanagh and Wilder There was sufficient evidence to support defendants conviction o f thirddegree fleeing or eluding a police officer Defendant argued that th e evidence failed to show that he refused to obey a clear signal to stop his vehicle The evidence showed that defendant continued to drive at a high rate of speed even after a marked police vehicle activated its overhead lights and that defendant only pulled into a parking lot because two poli ce vehicles blocked his path The evidence also demonstrated that defendant w as driving with an unlawful blood alcohol level had a suspended license and was a parole

eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Holbrook Jr and McDonald Dissent Wilder Since the erroneous unarmed robbery instructions seriously affected the fairness integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings independent of the defendants innocence and the error was not harmless defendants conviction of two counts of unarmed robbery was reversed and the case remanded for a new trial The prosecution conceded that the tria l court erred in refusing to give the requested instruction on the lesser included offense of larceny from a person but argued that the error had a negligible effect on the outcome of the case and was harmless The court disagreed because the jury was improperly instructed on the crime of unarm ed robbery the crime for which defendant was convicted and specific intent The court could not conclude that the jurys verdict would have been the same had it been given the proper instruction for unarmed robbery The court also concluded that the instructions given by the trial court conflated the crime of unarmed robbery and accessory after the fact Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Motion for a new trial Whether complainants recanting affidavit was

right to present witnesses at the preliminary examination Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Harris eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Gage Cavanagh and Wilder Since conduct and silence do not constitute an assertion of the righ t to remain silent the trial court did not err by admitting defendants statements made after he placed his hand over a question on the police officers statement form and told the officer dont write that After being informed of his Miranda rights before questioning began defendant chose to voluntarily answer questions Defendant answered the first nine questions however after initially answering the next question he put his hand over the question on the form and asked the officer not to write down his response because it was untruthful Defendant did not answer two more questions he was asked then informed the officer he would not answer any more questions and wanted an attorney Defendant claimed that his act of placing his hand over the statement form and telling the officer not to write down his response constituted an assertion of the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and revoked his previous waiver of that right The court disagreed because it was not until after the officer asked two subsequent questions that defendant verbally and unambiguously invoked hi s right to an attorney Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to

Issues Review of the Public Service Commission PSCs decision modifying the implementation of primary interexchange carrier charges PICCs on intrastate calls PSC jurisdiction Whether the PSC acted within its authority regarding inter LATA and intraLARA calls Application of the PIC C rates to pay phone calls Attorney fees Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Ameritech Michigan v Michigan Pub Serv Commn eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Smolenski Holbrook Jr and Gage The court affirmed the PSCs order modifying the implementation o f PICCs on intrastate calls because the PICCs were excessive and discriminatory Plaintiff imposed PICC rates on intrastatecalls that nearly corresponded t o the rates allowed by the FCC for interstate calls DefendantATT Communications sought a reduction of the PICC rates from plaintiff Althou gh there was sufficient evidence to determine that the rates were excessive the PSC lacked the necessary information to determine the proper rates Affirmed in part reversed in part Full Text Opinion Criminal Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Drug profile testimony Standard to be applied to error Court Michigan Supreme Court Case Name People v Huston eJournal Number Judges Corrigan Cavanagh Weaver Kelly Taylor Young Jr an d Markman The court vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals see eJourna l in the edition and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration of whether the error in admitting drug profile testimo ny required reversal of defendants conviction The Court of Appeals was instructed that if as plaintiff contended the claimed error was forfeite d the Court of Appeals was to review the issue using the plain error standar d but if the issue was adequately preserved to review for harmless error Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Proportionality of sentence Voluntariness of confession Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Cipponeri eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to a term of to years in prison after his conviction of CSC I Defendant molested his stepdaughter over several years beginning when she was about five years old Defendant admitted to numerous sexual acts with her as we ll as with other children for which he was not charged Defendants longter m sexual abuse of children indicated a low potential for rehabilitation Defendant also coerced the victims submission by preying on her concern f or her dog humiliated her during the act and threatened her should she ever tell what he had done In light of the repulsive nature of defendants alleged conduct that he robbed his stepdaughter of her childhood and tha t he presented a clear threat to other children the court concluded the sentence was not disproportionate Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Proportionality of sentence Trial courts articulation of its reasons for departing from the sentencing guidelines for the seconddegree murder conviction Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Johnson eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Bandstra Gage and Wilder Defendants to years sentence for his assault with intent t o commit murder conviction was proportionate to the seriousness and the offense Defendant argued that the trial court was under the mistaken belief that t he applicable guidelines for the minimum sentence range was to years rather than to years did not articulate sufficient reasons for deviating from the guidelines because the concerns cited by the trial cour t were adequately addressed by the guidelines and disregarded his rehabilitative progress and potential in imposing sentence However the trial court articulated sufficient reasons for a significant departure fro m the guidelines which was proportionate to defendants crime Affirmed Full Text Opinion Family Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Divorce Circuits authority to modify custody or visita tion decisions reached through binding mediation Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Graham v Graham eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The circuit court erroneously substituted its judgment for that of t he binding mediator regarding parenting time because a circuit court may onl y modify custody or visitation decisions reached through binding mediation upon proper cause shown or due to a change of circumstances The circuit court lacked authority to alter the mediators decision simply because it would have resolved the dispute differently Plaintiff did not argue that the mediators decision refusing to restrict the father from having fe male overnight guests while having parenting time with the parties minor ch ild was fraudulent outside his authority or influenced by partiality corruption or misconduct The circuit court did not find that a change of circumstances had occurred and did not provide any justification for its change in the mediators award Reversed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights Jurisdiction over children w here amended petition was served after jurisdictional trial Admissibility of hearsay Whether MCL Abm constitutes an impermissible ex post facto law Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Justin F eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Holbrook Jr Hood and Griffin The trial court did not lack jurisdiction because the amended petiti on allegedly contained new and different jurisdictional allegations and was not served on respondentmother until after the jurisdictional trial Comparison of the original and amended petitions revealed that the respondent was incorrect in her assertion that the amended petition contained approximately eight new additional and different jurisdiction al allegations The amended petition was merely a restructured version of the original petition To the extent that it did contain additional and different allegations any defect in service of the amended petition did n ot warrant reversal because the trial court indicated it was exercising jurisdiction over the children only on the basis of the allegations in the amended petition that matched the first nine allegations in the original petition Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Divorce Property division Inability to prove value of an asset a party seeks to have considered as separate property Valuation of marital home Valuation of a partys inheritance Exclusion of evidence of mari tal infidelity Trial courts failure to consider videotape never expressly offered into evidence Denial of motion for reconsideration Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Robinson v Robinson eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Bandstra Zahra and Meter The trial court did not err in failing to award plaintiff as separat e property the he claimed to have brought into the marriage because he failed to satisfy his burden of proving a reasonably ascertainable amount that he brought into the marriage The amount of money plaintiff brought into the marriage was disputed with plaintiffs claim supported only by his testimony and documents he had drafted Defendant characterized plaintiffs figure as highly inflated and the trial court foun d that while plaintiff probably brought more money into the marriage than defendant the figure was difficult to trace The trial court also did not err in valuing the marital home based on plaintiffs testimony rather than relying on formal appraisals Nothing requires a trial court t o accept the opinion of an expert over that of a layperson The division of the marital estate was affirmed Full Text Opinion Insurance Back to Quicklinks Issues Denial of coverage under policys uninsured motorist provisi on where there was no physical contact between the insured vehicle and anothe r vehicle Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name MacIntosh v Auto Club Ins Assn eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly Since reasonable minds could not differ in concluding that there was no contact between plaintiffs vehicle and the vehicle she swerved to avoid causing her to strike a curb the trial court properly granted summary disposition to defendantinsurer Generally where there is no physical contact between the insureds vehicle and the other vehicle uninsured motorist benefits are not available There was no physical nexus between the other car and the curb While the other car caused plaintiff to swerve and hit the curb that alone was not sufficient absent physical contact between the vehicles While plaintiff contended there was a question of fa ct whether the other vehicle struck her vehicle she failed to present any documentary evidence to support her contention Affirmed Full Text Opinion Litigation Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Negligence Intentional Tort Issues Dismissal of claim on basis plaintiff failed to respond to defendants motion for summary disposition regarding that claim Improp erly pleaded claim for tortious interference with contractual relations Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Auto Dealers Servs Inc v Walker Automotive Resources eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs conspiracy claim on the basis that plaintiff failed to respond to defendants motion for summar y disposition regarding that claim because plaintiff did respond to the motion and submitted evidence showing the existence of a genuine issue of fact Defendant asserted that it could not conspire to breach a contract o f which it had no knowledge Plaintiff responded that defendant did have knowledge and submitted an affidavit to that effect In addition while plaintiff failed to allege in its complaint that defendants instigatio n of the breach was unjustified or to allege facts from which such a conclusion could be drawn it could not be said that plaintiff would be unable to pro ve a tortious interference claim that was properly pleaded On remand plainti ff will have an opportunity to amend its complaint Reversed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Dismissal for failure to comply with the trial courts o rder regarding substitute counsel Dismissal for lack of progress Dismissal as a sanction for plaintiffs failure to provide discovery Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Masuch v GMRI Inc eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court erred to the extent it dismissed plaintiffs case with prejudice because plaintiff failed to comply with its order regarding substitute counsel Once plaintiffs counsel withdrew plaintiff was wi thout counsel and had the right to represent herself Therefore the court could not compel her to proceed only with counsel without a finding that she was a minor incompetent or otherwise incapable of representing herself Dismissal for lack of progress would also have been improper because the trial court did not provide the required notice

entitled to preclusive effect Whether the bankruptcy courts findings were sufficient to support the conclusion that the debt was nondischargeable Court Bankruptcy Appellate Panel Sixth Circuit Case Name In re Thompson eJournal Number Judges Howard Brown and MorgensternClarren The bankruptcy court erred in giving preclusive effect to the state court magistrates decision in the dischargeability proceeding because there was no final appealable state court judgment entered in the record which wa s entitled to preclusive effect and which could serve as a basis for the bankruptcy courts decision as to the amount and nature of the debt The bankruptcy courts findings of fact were insufficient to support the conclusion that the debt was nondischargeable pursuant to o a because the debtors conversion amounted to embezzlement The bankruptcy courts only independent finding from its trial of the matter did not address all the elements necessary to establish nondischargeability for embezzlement Reversed and remanded Full Text Opinion Constitutional Law Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Municipal Issues Special use permit allowing property owner to operate a busi

People v Washington eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Bandstra Wilder and Collins The presiding judge did not abuse her discretion in ordering a compe tency hearing when defendant appeared before her on the date set for his trial The presiding judge took testimony from the examining psychologist and defense counsel was allowed the opportunity to crossexamine the witness The psychologist who had interviewed defendant opined that defendant was able to articulate what was occurring in the court proceedings and assist his attorney with his defense Since defense counsel did not move in writi ng

modifyin g the standards for issuance of concealed weapons permits Writ of mandamus Legislation appropriating funds to a state institution Const art o Court Michigan Court of Appeals Published Case Name Michigan United Conservation Clubs v Secretary of State eJournal Number Judges OConnell McDonald and Meter Plaintiffs were denied a writ of mandamus ordering defendants to rej ect a petition for referendum on legislation modifying the standards for issuanc e of concealed weapons permits because the public act at issue was not an a ct making appropriations to state institutions as contemplated by Const art o The court found that the appropriation of million was directed at funding activities specifically associated with the issuance o f concealed weapon permits rather than sustaining the existence of the Department of State Police Absent any indication that the million appropriation or the fees paid by virtue of another statute were aimed at sustaining the core functions of the Department of State Police the court concluded that the act at issue was not one making appropriations to a sta te institution and was therefore subject to referendum Full Text Opinion Criminal Law

directed verdict on seconddegree murder charge Jury instructions Sentencing Court Michigan Court of Appeals Published Case Name People v Aldrich eJournal Number Judges Kelly and Collins Concurrence Whitbeck Defendants blood alcohol test results were admissible although the y were not under arrest at the time their blood alcohol levels were tested because the applicable statute does not mention arrest and provides for th e admissibility of blood alcohol test results in any civil or criminal proceeding where the blood upon which the test was run was drawn for medical treatment from a driver involved in an accident By its plain terms subsection e concerns tests done on blood drawn not for legal responsibility reasons but for medical purposes and is not limited to those under arrest The testimony presented at trial indicated that the medical procedures performed on defendants including the withdrawal of their blood were done for medical reasons Although one of the defendants claimed that he was not involved in the accident because his vehicle did not come in contact with another vehicle the defendant was involved in t he accident because his vehicle played a part in the accident

the vehicle Defense counsel elicited testimony that defendant was involved with Smiths former girlfriend Defense cou nsel also established that the tools were taken from a locked truck that the truck was not vandalized in the process so that it appeared access was gained through a key and that Smith had a key to the truck as an employee Defense counsel attempted to discredit Smiths testimony by

Judges Graham and Batchelder Concurrence Cole There was sufficient evidence to support defendants convictions for conspiracy and possession with the intent to distribute cocaine A rationa l trier of fact could find from the evidence presented at trial that an agreement to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine existed and tha t defendants and codefendants knowingly participated in that conspiracy The jury could infer that defendantSalgado knew he was delivering cocaine bas ed on his evasive statements to the police concerning who gave him the car an d the make of the car and from the fact that he met first with one of the codefendants despite his statement that he came to Louisville to visit his cousin Salgado was also present at the codefendants residence at the scheduled

regulation Plaintiff did not substantiate that either defendant secretly removed his name from the register and the affidavits he presented from other prior litigants against defendants did not refute

of minority employees to a facially neutral employment practice as required Summary disposition for defendan ts was affirmed Full Text Opinion Constitutional Law Back to Quicklinks This summary also

Full Text Opinion Criminal Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Jury instruction on negligent homicide as a lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter Trial courts failure to give instruction sua sponte Waiver Ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to request instruction or object to its omission Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Bridgewater eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Bandstra Gage and Wilder Although the trial courts failure to read the jury instruction o n negligent homicide as a lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughte r was error defense counsels affirmative withdrawal of the requested instruction and subsequent approval of the instructions given constituted a waiver of the issue The court also concluded that defense counsels decision to drop the request was sound trial strategy and even if the decision constituted deficient representation it did not prejudice defendant to the extent that the outcome of the trial would have been different The prosecution presented eyewitness testimony from two nonpolice witnesses establishing that defendant was traveling between and miles per hour disobeyed a red traffic signal and collided with t he minivan in which one of the victims was traveling Defendants convicti ons were affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Remedy for noncompliance with discovery order Dismissal of charges Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Byars eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the charges agai nst defendants with prejudice as a remedy for the police departments failu re to comply with a discovery order While it appeared that the department h ad no valid excuse for failing to comply in a timely manner many of the documents were provided about a month after the officer in charge received the order Defense counsel stated at that time that although he had not reviewed the documents in detail they appeared to include everything he needed to investigate his entrapment claim There was no showing that the late arrival of the documents prejudiced defendant who was out on bond a nd it was unclear what relevance they had in determining whether he was entrapped The more severe remedy of dismissal was not appropriate where a continuance would have alleviated any harm to defendants case Reverse d and remanded Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Ineffective assistance of counsel Sufficient evidence to s upport conviction of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Ferguson eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Doctoroff Cavanagh and Meter Contrary to defendants contention that his counsel was ineffecti ve for advising him not to testify on his own behalf the transcript revealed tha t defendant chose not to testify and there was no evidence that counsel persuaded him to refrain from testifying The evidence presented at trial amply supported the trial courts findings of fact and ultimate conclus ion of guilt Testimony supported the inference that the victim was worried about defendant seeing her with another man and that defendant shot her after he saw her with witnessReese The testimony also established a timeline that contradicted defendants claim in his police statement th at the shooting was accidental Defendants convictions were affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Loss of evidence before a defense request for its productio n Admission of evidence regarding defendants passenger Ineffective assistance of counsel Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Knott eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam White Cavanagh and Talbot The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant s motion to dismiss on the basis that she was denied a fair trial due to the police departments bad faith failure to save the videotape of her arrival at the station where the alleged assault occurred The tapes were destroyed as pa rt of the policy and procedure of the police department and not purposefully to destroy evidence for a forthcoming trial At the hearing on defendants motion to dismiss and at trial both officers testified that the recycling of tapes was a matter of policy and procedure Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Denial of motion to suppress the evidence Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Minge eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam White Cavanagh and Talbot Defendants motion to suppress was properly denied because the po lice stop of her vehicle was justified where the evidence gave rise to more than a hunch that defendant was involved in criminal activity Defendant was observed going into a house where police believed cocaine was being sold a police officer saw another person approach the same door and exchange mone y for suspected cocaine with a man inside the house and defendant came out the same door with a visible bulge under her shirt Based on the police officers experience in narcotics enforcement he believed that defenda nt was taking drugs from the suspected drug house where he had just observed a suspected drug transaction Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Ineffective assistance of counsel Joint representation MCR F Alleged impermissible comment by prosecutor on defendants silence Prosecutorial misconduct Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Williams eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Markey McDonald and Kelly Defendant failed to establish that he received ineffective assistanc e of counsel Since defendant and his brother stated clearly on the record that they desired to proceed with the same attorney and did not believe there would be a conflict of interest failed to identify an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected his lawyers performance and both defendants presented the identical defense The trial court raised the iss ue and explained to defendants that each had a right to his own attorney and that using the same attorney gave rise to the possibility of conflicting defenses Defendant personally made an informed waiver of his right to hav e separate counsel This waiver extinguished any error and precluded defenda nt from raising the issue on appeal Affirmed Full Text Opinion Employment Labor Law Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Negligence Intentional Tort Issues Defamation action by former employee Whether claim was pre empted by federal labor law Sufficient evidence to sustain each element of defamation claim Damages Absolute privilege Qualified privilege Jury instructions regarding actual malice and reckless disregard Motion for directed verdict or JNOV Whether plaintiffs counsel argued facts not in evidence Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Slawick v Detroit Newspaper Agency eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Griffin Jansen and Gage Plaintiffformer employees defamation claim was not preempted by federal labor law because defendant used the CBA solely as a defense to the claim contending that publication of the discharge letter to the union president was absolutely privileged The letter of discharge accused plaintiff of throwing liquid substances on security personnel Reviewing the record th e court determined that the jury could have found that defendant acted with actual malice in disseminating the discharge letter There was evidence at trial that the contents of the discharge letter were made with reckless disregard for the truth The trial court did not err in denying defendant s motion for a directed verdict or JNOV Evidence supported the jurys aw ard of for noneconomic damages for exemplary damages and in economic damages Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears

the initial dispositional hearing Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Guy eJournal Number Judges Memorandum McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court did not err in terminating respondentfathers pa rental rights at the initial dispositional hearing The petition contained a proper request for termination and the family court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the child came under its jurisdiction The family court also did not clearly err in finding by clear and convincing evidence that one or more of the facts alleged in the petition were true and justified termination of parental rights Respondent had a lengthy criminal history multiple incidents of domestic violence longstanding drug and alcohol abuse longterm failure to parent the chil d and failed to comply with the court ordered plan developed as part of a guardianship proceeding Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights under oo baii g i and j Best interests of the child Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Jones eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam White Cavanagh and Talbot Respondentmothers parental rights to her minor child were prope rly terminated because the asserted statutory grounds for termination were established by clear and convincing evidence Respondents parental rig hts to her three other children were previously terminated as a consequence o f her drug use and her failure to rehabilitate and she continued to use dru gs during her pregnancy with the minor causing the minor to be born addicted to crack cocaine Respondent continued to abuse drugs after the minors birth did not set forth a meaningful plan to provide for the minors c are her housing arrangements were transient and she had not maintained employment for a significant duration of time Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights based on oo bci g j and kiii Alleged bias of trial court Jurisdiction over minor child Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Pittao eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam White Cavanagh and Talbot The family court did not clearly err in finding that the statutory g rounds for termination were established by clear and convincing evidence The respondentfathers claim that during the proceedings he was essentially on trial for the murder of his wife was unpersuasive The trial court specifically indicated in its findings that it did not consider respondent s wifes murder The trial court also indicated in detail the factors on whi ch it relied including respondents failure to address his substance abuse a nd domestic violence issues his lack of credibility and his failure to comp ly with the case treatment plan The evidence did not show that termination o f respondents parental rights was clearly not in the childs best interests Affirmed Full Text Opinion Insurance Back to Quicklinks Issues Whether the loss payable clause in the insurance policy was an ordinary or a standard loss payable clause Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Van Reken v Michigan Basic Property Ins Assn eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Doctoroff Cavanagh and Meter The loss payable clause covering plaintiffsland contract vendors i nterest in the property was clearly an ordinary loss payable clause because it provided for payment to the insuredland contract vendees and plaintiffs as their interests may appear without any additional language providing tha t plaintiffs would be protected from loss based on any act or neglect of the insured Defendant issued an insurance policy for the property naming the vendees as the insureds and plaintiffs were listed under a loss payable clause Accordingly plaintiffs right of recovery was no greater than tha t of the vendees Because the policys theft and intentional act provisions clearly precluded the vendees from recovering plaintiffs were also precluded from recovering The trial court should have denied plaintiffs motion for summary disposition and granted defendants motion for summary disposition Reversed and remanded Full Text Opinion Litigation Back to Quicklinks Issues Motion to strike supplemental witness list Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Moton v Oakwood Healthcare Inc eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting plaintiffs motion to strike defendants supplemental witness list There was no evidence indicating a mutual agreement to postpone discovery and while plaintiffs deposition was delayed that did not explain defendants failure to con duct timely discovery from plaintiffs treating physicians and coworkers Defendant failed to adequately explain its delay in obtaining the private investigators material Defendant argued that the trial court should h ave accepted the supplemental witness list because defendant explicitly reserv ed the right to amend its original list However the court held that allowin g parties to circumvent the rules by claiming a reservation of rights would defeat the purpose and authority of the court rules Affirmed Full Text Opinion Municipal Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Real Property Issues Zoning variance Zoning Board of Appeals ZBA Interpretat ion of the applicable township ordinance and whether the ordinance prevented the building of a singlefamily residence on lot in question Whether the circuit court properly analyzed the ZBAs denial of a variance Selfcr eated hardship Taking Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Domine v Township of Grosse Ile eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Doctoroff Cavanagh and Meter The circuit court erred in reversing the ZBAs decision to deny a variance because competent material and substantial evidence supported the ZBA s decision Plaintiffs property did not conform to the zoning ordinance because it failed to meet the lot size requirements While this was a practical difficulty inherent in the property itself this practical difficulty could have been avoided if plaintiff had not decided to sell th e second lot separately Plaintiff not the zoning ordinance could reasonab ly be deemed to have caused the practical difficulty Consideration of the effect of the requested variance on others and on the character of the subdivision was also appropriate Reversed and the decision of ZBA was reinstated Full Text Opinion Negligence Intentional Tort Back to Quicklinks Issues Whether plaintiffs claim was barred by the firemans rule Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Berry v John Carlo Inc eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court properly granted summary disposition to the defendantdredging contractor because it was undisputed that defendants a ct of blocking the road with dredged material took place prior to plaintiffpolice officer beginning his park patrol activities Plaintiff w as injured as his car hit a pile of dredged material left on the closed road by defendant and the car became airborne Plaintiff claimed that defendant acted in a grossly negligent manner by placing the dredged material on th e road and by failing to place proper warning devices around the material T he firemans rule applied because the defendants conduct of which plaintiff complained occurred prior to the commencement of plaintiffs patrol and arrival on the road and was not unrelated to plaintiffs reason for being at the location where the collision occurred The area where plaintiff was injured was closed due to defendants activities and his duties included checking the area for trespassers Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Negligence Intentional destruction of relevant evidence S anctions Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Garrison v Mount Clemens Gen Hosp eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Hood and Smolenski The trial court properly held that plaintiffs failed to present any evidence to show that defendanthospital was negligent or was responsible for defendantReids conduct where plaintiff was injured outside the hospital when he was struck by Reids car which rolled into him while unattended The evidence showed that Reid left the car without setting the parking brake and the car rolled down the drive and hit plaintiff However the gearshift was found in neutral the key was not in the ignition and Reid had taken her keys inside and given them to the desk nurse Although defense experts concluded that the key had to be in the ignition for the c ar to travel along the path it took there was no evidence supporting the experts conjecture plaintiff offered none and the experts themselves could not explain how the key could have been in the ignition if it was with the desk nurse Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Premises liability Open and obvious doctrine Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Girard v Dearborn Cinemas eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly Since plaintiff admitted that he had specific knowledge of the ladde rs defective condition where the safety latches that extended the ladder had been removed and in their place a piece of rope had been tied to two rungs and he knew that the ladder would retract if the rope broke the danger presented by the ladder was open and obvious to him The trial court properly granted summary disposition to both defendants Plaintiff worked as a roofer for a company hired to perform roofing work at defendants premises While working there plaintiff and his coworkers used an extensi on ladder left on defendants roof by an unknown party Plaintiff and others used the ladder for several days without incident however the rope broke while plaintiff was on it the ladder retracted and plaintiff fell and wa s injured Affirmed Full Text

landlord met its burde n in attempting to provide reasonable accommodations for the tenant with a known mental disability Whether the district court improperly drew inferences against the nonmoving party Court US Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit Case Name Groner v Golden Gate Gardens Apartments eJournal Number Judges Gilman Siler and Duggan Deciding an issue of first impression in the circuit the court held that a plaintiff in a Fair Housing Act case has the burden of proof to establish the reasonableness of a proposed accommodation Since landlordGolden Gate had a legitimate interest in ensuring the quiet enjoyment of all its tenants and there was no showing of a reasonable accommodation that would have enabled the plaintiff who suffered from schizophrenia and depression to remain in his apartment without significantly disturbing another tenant plaintiff failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to a violation of his rights under either the Fair Housing Act or the equivalen t state laws Plaintiff allegedly screamed and slammed doors within his apartment causing the tenant in the apartment above his to make repeated complaints to Golden Gates manager The parties attempted unsuccessfully to resolve the issue over a period of time during which Golden Gate soundproofed plaintiffs front door and attempted to work with his social worker to resolve plaintiffs behavior Affirmed Full Text Opinion Constitutional Law Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Media Law Issues The First Amendment right of the press to gather information Whether the court clerk could grant access to identity of trial jurors Court US District Court Eastern District of Michigan Case Name In re Bay City Times eJournal Number Judges Lawson Since the subject of the request release of the names and communiti es of residence of the trial jurors in the underlying criminal case constituted matters which were already in the public record and releasing the information would not unduly infringe on the jurors privacy interests th e court granted the petitionernewspapers request The underlying criminal case involved the former superintendent of the city wastewater treatment plant The jury returned a verdict on the charges of violation of the Clea n Water Act During voir dire each prospective juror announced his or her na me and community of residence The trial attracted the attention of the local media After the verdict was returned a reporter requested the names of t he trial jurors from the court clerk Thereafter petitioner requested an order for the disclosure of the jurors names and communities of residence but not their telephone numbers or home addresses The request was measure d and confined to matters within the public record and its disclosure would not compromise juror privacy Full Text Opinion Criminal Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Order compelling defendant to produce reports created by his expert witnesses when no such reports were created or existed MCR Trial courts authority to modify the court rules Court Michigan Court of Appeals Published Case Name People v Phillips eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Holbrook Jr Hood and Griffin The trial court erred in ordering defendant to disclose to the prose cutor reports created by his expert witnesses when no such reports were created or existed and the prosecutor was not entitled to the unwritten observations of defendants expert witnesses The plain language of the applicable court rule provided only that reports produced by defendant s experts were subject to disclosure and reports necessarily meant only written reports that have actually been produced The court held that ther e is no requirement for an expert to create a physical report and an expert may testify based solely on observations obtained at trial The trial cour t also did not show why good cause existed to modify the court rule in this case Reversed and remanded Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Writ of habeas corpus pursuant to o Right to a timely parole violation hearing Granting or rescinding of good time sentence credits D ue process Michigan Department of Corrections MDOC Court US District Court Eastern District of Michigan Case Name Moore v Hofbauer eJournal Number Judges Tarnow Petitioners request for a writ of habeas corpus was denied and t he petition dismissed because his parole revocation hearing was held within a reasonable time after he was taken into custody and he was not improperly denied or deprived good time credits Although petitioners revocation hearing occurred days after he was available for MDOC custody instead of the days provided by state statute the hearing was held within a reasonable time The hearing held within two months after petitioner was taken into custody on the parole violator warrant was presumptively reasonably timely and petitioner failed to show prejudice The warden s decision not to grant petitioner good time credits for the period during which petitioner tested positive for controlled substances and was a parol e absconder was a reasonable exercise of discretion Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Admissibility of victims statements about abuse to police o fficer and her mother Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Denton eJournal Number Judges Memorandum McDonald Smolenski and Kelly Although the trial court abused its discretion in allowing a police officer to testify under MRE as to what the victim told her about the abus e the officers testimony was admissible under MRE dB to rebut an implied charge of recent fabrication or improper motive on the part of the victim The evidence did not fall within the excited utterance exception t o the hearsay rule because the statements were neither spontaneous nor made while the victim was still under the influence of the excitement caused by the abuse Defendants trial theory was that the victim had fabricated the alleged abuse and had lied because she resented his attempts to discipline her The victims prior consistent statement tended to rebut those claims Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Sentencing of a second habitual offender Jurisdiction to resentence defendant Applicability of MCL MSA Right to a speedy trial and delayed sentencing Proportionality of sentence Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Phillips eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam White Cavanagh and Talbot Defendants sentence as a second habitual offender was supported by the facts of the case and his age and his ineligibility for disciplinary credits as an habitual offender which meant that he had to serve his enti re minimum sentence before becoming eligible for parole did not negate that Defendants argument that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to resentence him failed because the statute upon which he relied did not app ly to his case and even if it did there was good cause for the delay From the time leave was denied by the Supreme Court sentencing was delayed for approximately one year and four months Defendant filed a motion to quash resentencing that caused resentencing to be adjourned and after the motio n was heard and denied resentencing took place within days Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Habitual offender charge based on prior conviction that was a felony and at time of OUIL conviction constituted a misdemeanor Ineffective assistance of counsel Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Piotrowski eJournal Number Judges Memorandum Jansen Zahra and Owens The trial court did not err by using defendants prior conviction to convict him as a second habitual offender because the offense is now classified a s a misdemeanor Defendant claimed that use of the prior conviction in this manner violated the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Michiga n Constitutions The court disagreed and affirmed defendants conviction as a second habitual offender and the sentence imposed pursuant to that conviction A sentencing court may use a prior conviction of a crime that was classified as a felony at the time it was committed to enhance the sentence for a subsequent felony conviction even though the prior crime h as been reclassified as a misdemeanor Defendants prior conviction of failin g to return rental property was a felony at the time he committed the offense therefore the trial court properly used it to sentence him as a second habitual offender Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues The trial courts refusal to accept guilty plea Whether the trial court may reject pleas to reduced charges Waiver Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Winbush eJournal Number Judges Memorandum McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court did not commit reversible error when it refused to a ccept defendants guilty plea to a probation violation The petition charging defendant with probation violation contained six allegations The prosecutor indicated that if defendant pleaded guilty to one allegation she would drop the others The trial court disapproved of that procedure and required the parties to proceed with a hearing A defendant does not have an absolute right to have a guilty plea accepted and the court may reject a plea in the exercise of its sound discretion The trial court may also reject pleas to reduced charges Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Motion to dismiss based on the grounds that defendants s tatements were not true threats and therefore were protected speech Knowingly transmitting a threat to kidnap in interstate commerce in violation of USC o c Knowingly transmitting a threat to injure in interstate commerce in violation of o c Making interstate telephone calls that were lewd indecent obscene and lascivious with the intent to abuse harass and annoy another person in violation of USC o aA and B Court US Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit Case Name United States v Landham eJournal Number Judges Suhrheinrich Moore and Edmunds The district court erred in failing to dismiss Count Three of the indictment alleging that defendant knowingly transmitted a threat to kidna p in interstate commerce The statement You will not have Priscilla by her second birthday because Im going to have all your children You will not have Priscilla to raise Im going to get her contained no communication containing a direct threat to kidnap nor would a reasonable observer in the victims shoes perceive it as an indirect threat The defendant and the victim were embroiled in a divorce proceeding The victi m had obtained a Domestic Violence Order removing defendant from the home an d barring him from contact with his daughter Defendants statement Im going to get her in context referred to the custody battle during the divorce proceeding There was no allegation that defendant had ever attempted to abduct the child in the past Defendant could not have legall y been charged with kidnapping since Priscilla was his biological daughter a nd his parental rights had not been terminated Defendants convictions we re reversed and remanded Full Text Opinion Family Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights Whether petitioner made reas onable attempts to reunify the family Sufficiency of the referees findings Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Balowski eJournal Number Judges Memorandum McDonald Smolenski and Kelly Although respondentfather complied with some aspects of the parent agency agreement the trial court did not clearly err in finding that the statuto ry grounds for termination were established by clear and convincing evidence and that the evidence did not show that termination of respondents parent al rights was clearly not in the childrens best interests Respondent claime d that petitioner failed to make reasonable efforts to reunify the family however those deficiencies did not involve the principal issue leading to termination which was respondents failure to successfully address his substance abuse problem Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights under oo bg and j Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re DJH eJournal Number Judges Memorandum Collins Hoekstra and Gage The trial court did not err in concluding that clear and convincing evidence supported termination of respondentmothers parental rights The recor d showed that respondent and her children shared a close bond However it also showed that respondent continued to have contact with and marry her boyfriend after she knew of his violent tendencies and that he likely injured her children and after the court ordered that he have no contact with the children Although respondent later divorced her husband and testified that she was no longer involved with him other trial testimony indicated that she did continue to be involved with him The trial court s findings indicated that it did not credit respondents testimony and t he court found nothing in the record to suggest that the trial court clearly erred in that regard Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights under oo bbi bii g and j Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re MJCR eJournal Number Judges Memorandum Holbrook Jr Hood and Griffin Even if the family court erred in terminating respondentmothers parental rights under o bg the error was harmless because the remaining statutory grounds with regard to her were established with clear and convincing evidence The evidence indicated that the mother was in a position where she should have known of the sexual abuse of her daughter b y her husband respondentfather her daughters stepfather She was well aware of the physical abuse of both children by the father yet continued to reside with him exposing the children to further abuse The mother also h ad a history of emotional and psychological problems including several suici de attempts in front of the children Termination of both respondents par ental rights was affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights under oo bd and j W hether respondentfailure to fulfill the terms of a transition plan to regain custody due to the lack of necessary help and referrals Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Roe eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Doctoroff Saad and Wilder There was clear and convincing evidence that respondentmother faile d to comply with the placement and transition plan to regain custody of the minor child after the child was placed in a limited guardianship Although respondent did eventually complete parenting classes and undergo a psychiatric examination she failed to secure adequate housing for the child did not demonstrate any financial ability to support the child did not participate in counseling and did not take her medications for a diagnosed psychotic disorder There was no merit to respondents claim that her failure to fulfill the terms of the plan was the fault of the probate court Termination of respondents parental rights under both statutory grounds relied upon by the family court was affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights under oo bci g a nd j Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Walker eJournal Number Judges Memorandum White Cavanagh and Talbot The family court did not clearly error in terminating respondentmot hers parental rights because the statutory bases for termination were established by clear and convincing evidence Respondent failed to substantially comply with the treatment plan and work toward reunification with her children Respondent failed to obtain and maintain suitable housing for herself and the children and showed an inability to control a nd supervise the children resulting in harm to them She did not interact wi th the children during visitation she failed to obtain and

Daughtrey Moore Cole Cla y and Gilman Dissent Kennedy Boggs Norris Suhrheinrich Siler and Batc helder Plaintiffs stated a claim for securities fraud by creating a str ong inference that defendants projected financial wellbeing at a time when they had actual knowledge that their statements were false or misleading while knowingly omitting material facts that would have tempered their optimism Plaintiffs allegations suggested that it must have become ob vious that the impact of the Balanced Budget Act would be adverse to defendantcorporation a health care provider yet defendants persisted in making favorable predictions and feigning ignorance of the Acts potent ial negative impact on earnings The district courts order dismissing plai ntiff s action for failure to state a claim was reversed as to plaintiffs allegations regarding defendants projections and disclaimers of knowle dge about the Balanced Budget Act and remanded for further discovery and proceedings Full Text Opinion

Unpublished Case Name Anchrum v Airtouch Cellular eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Zahra Smolenski and Gage Plaintiffs claim that she was terminated from employment based on r ace failed as a matter of law because she did not present evidence suggesting that any similarly situated nonAfricanAmerican employee was treated differently for the same or similar conduct Plaintiff was terminated allegedly because she failed to provide documentation of coaching sessions she was required to perform with her direct employees Defendantemployer claimed plaintiff was unable to confirm the coaching sessions took place Plaintiff noted that one Caucasian supervisor was merely written up for failing to coach her employees However there was no evidence that any of the other supervisors were ever believed to have falsified coaching report s Further defendants met their burden of presenting a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for plaintiffs discharge when they asserted that she was terminated because she was believed to have falsified the coaching reports and plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut that claim Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks This summary also

the ADA Whether plaintiff was otherwise qualified Whether defendant failed to provide reasonable accommodation Improper ord er that the jury verdict not be entered Court US Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit Case Name Kiphart v Saturn Corp eJournal Number Judges Collier Daughtrey and Gilman The plaintiffemployee presented sufficient evidence to support the jurys verdict in his favor because he established that he was substantially limited in his ability to perform manual tasks the full task rotation was not an essential job function and plaintiff was otherwise qualified a nd defendant failed to provide reasonable accommodation Plaintiff allege d that defendant improperly used its concept of job rotation under which ea ch member of a work team rotated through each of the jobs assigned to the tea m to justify its refusal to place him on any team assigned one or more tasks he could not perform in violation of the ADA Once the jury determined tha t full task rotation was not an essential job function as alleged by defendant and plaintiff was otherwise qualified the jury could have reasonably determined that given the imperfect implementation of the job rotation system defendants de facto requirement that only restricted employees be fully functionalfully rotational was unreasonable The jury could have reasonably concluded that the hardship of accommodating plainti ff by allowing him not to perform the one or two team tasks he could not perform would not have unduly burdened defendant Reversed and remanded Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks This summary also

infliction of emotional distress but evidence presented at trial on plaintiffAnthony Suduls o claim was legally sufficient to suppor t a jury finding that the force defendants used during his arrest was unreasonable Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity on the o claim but the infliction of emotional distress claim was barred by governmental immunity The trial court also did not abuse its discretion i n determining that defendants were not entitled to a new trial on either Anthony Suduls o claim or his assault and battery claim Affirmed in part reversed in part and remanded for further consideration of defendants motions for remittur or new trial on the basis that the jur ys damage award was clearly excessive Full Text Opinion Contracts Back to Quicklinks This summary also

and collateral estoppel Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Rock Constr Inc v Onyebuchi eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Holbrook Jr Hood and Griffin While the posture of the case did not preclude the ruling the trial court erred in concluding that defendants failure to secure financing was excused by the defense of impossibility Defendants failure to secure financing was reasonably foreseeable and terms of the parties contrac t indicated that they had expressly considered and contemplated that possibility However given the equities of the case the trial court did not err when it granted defendants the right to recover their dow n payment despite the terms of the contracts liquidated damages clause Plaintiff was granted the right to sell the house which had increased in value during the period between the contract and the lawsuit The trial court also incorrectly ruled that plaintiff was barred from further suit b y res judicata and collateral estoppel

offender in the custody of the Family Independence Agency FIA Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Bonaroti eJournal Number Judges Memorandum Jansen Zahra and Owens Placement of the juvenile defendant with the FIA was not a disproportionately severe punishment Following the juveniles plea of guilty to resisting and obstructing a police officer and malicious destruction of property over he was warned to attend school and not get suspended After the juvenile transferred schools to get out of troubl e he was suspended twice within the first month The juvenile also had failing grades and was well below his grade level in reading The trial court did not abuse its discretion in placing the juvenile with the FIA Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Sufficient evidence to support conviction of felonious assa ult Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Baskin eJournal Number Judges Memorandum Jansen Zahra and Owens The trial courts findings in defendants bench trial resulti ng in his conviction of felonious assault were sufficient to support defendants conviction Although the trial court was unable to completely accept the testimony of any of the witnesses and acquitted defendant on five of the six charges against him it found that defendant struck the victim in the head with a baseball bat That finding was amply supported by the evidence which did not clearly weigh in defendants favor A baseball bat when used to inflict injury can constitute a dangerous weapon Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Entrapment Prosecutorial misconduct Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Gilders eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Fitzgerald and Markey The trial court properly found that the undercover officer did nothi ng but offer defendant the opportunity to commit the crime and defendant was not entrapped by the undercover officers conduct Defendant argued that he on ly wanted to purchase one ounce of cocaine and that the officers conduct in refusing to deal in any amount less than two ounces was entrapment The officer put the word out on the street that he had cocaine for sale but would not sell less than two ounces Defendant contacted the officer numerous times to make a deal His problem was not that he did not want tw o ounces but that he could not afford two ounces at once After obtaining sufficient cash to complete a twoounce transaction the defendant did not hesitate to contact the officer The evidence did not indicate that the us e of a twoounce minimum was intended as a means to enhance possible sentences The conduct of the police was not so outrageous that it overcam e the will of defendant Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Circuit court jurisdiction Prosecutors charging proced ure Amendment of information to reinstate charges District court refusal to bind over solely on basis it disbelieved the complainants testimony at the preliminary examination Sentencing Response to challenges to PSIR Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Rivera eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Fitzgerald and Markey Although somewhat irregular the prosecutors procedures in this matter provided the circuit court with jurisdiction over each of the charged crimes The circuit court possessed jurisdiction to join the misdemeanor assault charge pending before the district court which was reduced after preliminary examination from a charge of assault with intent to commit murder with the felony kidnapping charge pending before the circuit court Defendant identified no authority or rationale that would deny the circuit court jurisdiction over a separately charged misdemeanor arising from the same criminal act or occurrence as felony charges already pending in the circuit court The circuit courts amendment of the information to rein state charges dismissed by the district court after the preliminary examination also did not constitute unfair surprise Defendants conviction and sentence was affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Other acts evidence Application of the VanderVliet test Ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to challenge competency of sevenyear old to testify Proportionality of sentence of to months imprisonment for CSC III Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Stoutmiles eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Collins Hokestra and Gage Evidence of a previous sexual act that defendant allegedly committed against a sevenyear old was properly admitted because it met each prong of the VanderVliet test The evidence was offered for a proper purpose to sh ow a scheme or plan by defendant to commit the crime in his living room despi te the presence of others Defendants theory was that the victim was fabricating the accusations The evidence was relevant because it made defendants guilt more probable than it would have been without the evidence Since defendant had previously committed unlawful sexual acts in his crowded living room it was not implausible for him to have performed similar acts on the complainant under similar circumstances The evidence s probative value was not substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice and the trial court gave a limiting instruction Defendants conviction and sentence were affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Withdrawal of guilty plea Effect of deferral of acceptance of plea pending review of a not yet prepared presentence report Fed R Crim P e A fair and just reason for withdrawal of plea Court US Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit Case Name United States v Mader eJournal Number Judges Krupansky Boggs and Batchelder Defendant had to provide a fair and just reason to support withdrawa l of his guilty plea even though that plea had not yet been accepted by the district court and he failed to do so At the plea hearing the district court deferred acceptance of the plea and the plea agreement pending revie w of a not yet prepared presentence report Contrary to defendants argum ent that did not allow him to withdraw the plea without any justification Defendants contention that he had a fair and just reason to withdraw h is plea was also unavailing Defendant knew at the time of the plea hearing that the gun that he ostensibly sold to the eventual murderer of a police officer had jammed at the scene of that shooting and was not the gun that killed the officer The only new information in the presentence report was the governments admission that defendant did not sell that gun directl y to the murderer Denial of defendants motion to withdraw his plea was aff irmed Full Text Opinion Employment Labor Law Back to Quicklinks This

Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Breon eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Murphy and Meter The family court did not clearly error in terminating respondentfat hers parental rights because several factors demonstrated that without regard to intent he could not provide proper care for the children and would not be able to do so within a reasonable time A foster care worker testified that respondent was dismissed from a drug treatment program because of a relapse and an altercation with a worker The foster care worker also testified that respondent failed to complete the aftercare portion of another drug treatment program failed to provide documentation regarding parenting classes and had inadequate housing Respondent admitted that he had inadequate housing and failed to provide documentatio n of compliance with his treatment plan Affirmed Full Text Opinion Litigation Back to Quicklinks Issues Res judicata Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Creer v Hills eJournal Number Judges Memorandum McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court properly found that plaintiff attempted to split his cause of action to avoid the effect of an arbitration order entered in an earlie r case and that this suit was barred by the doctrine of res judicata Both actions were based on the same occurrence and since the defendant in this action was president of the defendantcorporation in the prior action the defendants were essentially the same This action did not allege a new bas is for liability and the claim against the builders

Administrative Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Registration fees for interstate motor carriers under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act ISTEA Whether effect o f reciprocity agreements must be considered in determining amount of fee charged or collected on November Interstate Commerce Commission ICC Court Michigan Supreme Court Case Name Yellow Freight Sys Inc v State of Michigan eJournal Number Judges Weaver Corrigan Taylor Young Jr and Markman Dissen t Kelly Dissent Cavanagh In an issue of first impression in any state court the court held t hat under the plain language of the ISTEA reciprocity agreements were irrelevant in determining what registration fees were charged or collected as of November Plaintiff alleged that defendants collected registration fees in excess of the amount allowed under ISTEA contending that Michigan could not alter its reciprocity agreements because these wer e frozen at their November levels The court declined to defer to t he ICCs interpretation banning states from charging registration fees in excess of preexisting reciprocal discounts The court determined that the plain meaning of the ISTEA was clear and applied the statute as written without reaching the agency interpretation The ISTEA itself referred only to the fees collected or charged and contained no reference to reciprocit y agreements The court concluded that it must look at the generic fee Michigan charged or collected from carriers as of November not a t the fees paid by plaintiff in any given year Reversed and remanded Justice Kelly dissenting disagreed with the conclusion that recipr ocity agreements were not relevant to determining the registration fees that Michigan charged and would have affirmed the decisions of the Court of Appeals and Court of Claims in favor of plaintiff Justice Cavanagh also dissenting likewise found the statutory lang uage ambiguous and that the ICC permissibly construed it in taking into account reciprocity agreements

Hoekstra and Markey Since the plaintiffformer employee failed to bring her CRA claims w ithin three years of the date of her initial discharge for violation of one of defendants work rules the trial court properly granted summary disposition to defendant Plaintiff argued that the trial court used the wrong date when calculating the limitation period and should have used th e last day she was employed by defendant Although plaintiff was technically reinstated for a period of time as a result of administrative decisions an d again discharged the court disagreed that the second and final discharge should apply for purposes of calculating the limitations period Accordingly plaintiffs race and marital status discrimination claims accrued on the date of her initial discharge that was for allegedly discriminatory reasons Plaintiffs wrongful discharge claim was also properly dismissed by the trial court because plaintiff failed to appeal t he final administrative decision to the circuit

discrimination were p roperly dismissed Plaintiff a year old AfricanAmerican female alleged that her reassignment was motivated by defendantemployers administrators desire to assemble a young Caucasian male staff Plaintiff alleged that a statement by defendants manager was direct evidence defendant discrimi nated against her based on age However at most plaintiffs testimony established that defendants manager observed that the department was m ade up of young inexperienced employees Further plaintiffs subjective impressions of her reassignment as a deadend job were insufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination Plaintiffs discriminat ory replacement arguments based on gender and race failed because she was not replaced by a nonmember of the protected class Summary disposition in favor of the defendant was affirmed Full Text Opinion Constitutional Law Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Real Property Issues The constitutionality of the Opening of Private Roads and Te mporary Highways Act the Private Roads Act MCL et seq Whether the act authorizes a taking primarily benefiting a private rather than a public purpose Overruling Bieker v Suttons Bay Twp Supervisor and McKeighan v Grass Lake Twp Supervisor II Court Michigan Supreme Court Case Name Tolksdorf v Griffith eJournal Number Judges Kelly Corrigan Cavanagh Weaver Taylor Young Jr Not participating Markman The court struck down the Private Roads Act allowing a private land owner to petition a township supervisor to open a private road across another landowners property as providing for an unconstitutional taking under art o of the Michigan Constitution of because it authorizes a taking that primarily benefits a private rather than a public purpose Plaintiffs owned landlocked property and defendants owned a neighboring parcel Defendants refused plaintiffs requests seeking a paved road acros s their parcel and an easement for utility lines Plaintiffs sued requesting a writ of mandamus compelling the township supervisor to proceed under the act The trial court ruled against plaintiffs and the Court of Appeals fou nd error in the refusal to issue the writ The court concluded that since the act gives individuals a permanent and continuous right to pass over anothers property it allowed a permanent physical occupation of private property by means of government action and was a taking The taking authorized by the act appeared to merely be an attempt by a private entity to use the states powers to acquire what it could not get through arms length negotiations with defendants and the primary benefit inured to the landlocked private owners rather than the public Reversed and the trial courts ruling for defendants was reinstated Full Text Opinion

Michigan Court of Appeals Published Case Name DiPonio Constr Co Inc v Rosati Masonry Co Inc eJournal Number Judges Smolenski Zahra and Gage In an issue of first impression the court ruled that the sixyear s tatute of limitations found in MCL applies to civil claims brought unde r the Michigan builders trust act therefore the trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffsubcontractors action on the basis it was timeba rred Applying analysis found in case precedent the court concluded that when a statute itself does not provide a limitation period a cause of action arising from a statutory violation is subject to the sixyear limitation period found in o Plaintiffs claim accrued when defendants were paid on the project and defendants failed to pay plaintiff the amounts due on that project Reversed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Negligence Intentional Tort Issues Retained control over the construction project Immunity un der the exclusive

proceedings consistent with this opinion We do not retain jurisdiction The opinion remained the same in all other respects The earlier release date was vacated Full Text Opinion Corrections Back to Quicklinks Issues Parole Legitimate reasons for parole board to deny parole to a prisoner assessed with only an average probability of parole Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Searles v Parole Bd eJournal Number Judges Memorandum Gage Cavanagh and Wilder Defendantparole board did not abuse its discretion in denying parol e to plaintiff a prisoner assessed with only an average probability of parole and the trial court erred in reversing the parole boards decision The parole board identified several legitimate reasons for denying plaintiff parole including the type of crime CSC II the identity of the victim plaintiffs unstable domestic and employment histories and her inability to follow rules reflected in her misconduct record The tri al courts order was reversed and the parole boards decision denying p arole was reinstated Full Text Opinion Criminal Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Sufficiency of evidence to support conviction of thirddegr ee fleeing or eluding a police officer Alleged police brutality Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Buchanan eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Gage Cavanagh and Wilder There was sufficient evidence to support defendants conviction o f thirddegree fleeing or eluding a police officer Defendant argued that th e evidence failed to show that he refused to obey a clear signal to stop his vehicle The evidence showed that defendant continued to drive at a high rate of speed even after a marked police vehicle activated its overhead lights and that defendant only pulled into a parking lot because two poli ce vehicles blocked his path The evidence also demonstrated that defendant w as driving with an unlawful blood alcohol level had a suspended license and was a parole absconder which supported an inference that he was intentionally trying to evade the police Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Whether the trial courts refusal to give the requested inst ruction on the lesser included offense of larceny from a person was harmless error The CarinesOlano plain error rule Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Davidson eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Holbrook Jr and McDonald Dissent Wilder Since the erroneous unarmed robbery instructions seriously affected the fairness integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings independent of the defendants innocence and the error was not harmless defendants conviction of two counts of unarmed robbery was reversed and the case remanded for a new trial The prosecution conceded that the tria l court erred in refusing to give the requested instruction on the lesser included offense of larceny from a person but argued that the error had a negligible effect on the outcome of the case and was harmless The court disagreed because the jury was improperly instructed on the crime of unarm ed robbery the crime for which defendant was convicted and specific intent The court could not conclude that the jurys verdict would have been the same had it been given the proper instruction for unarmed robbery The court also concluded that the instructions given by the trial court conflated the crime of unarmed robbery and accessory after the fact Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Motion for a new trial Whether complainants recanting affidavit was newly discovered evidence Whether defendant demonstrated a miscarriag e of justice Whether constitutional rights were violated Waiver of trial b y jury Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Felder eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Hood Doctoroff and Kelly Defendants motion for a new trial was properly denied because co mplainant s affidavit recanting her testimony was unreliable The record relating t o the circumstances immediately preceding complainants recantation suppo rted the trial courts finding that defendant engaged in inappropriate and harassing behavior toward complainant which indicated that defendant coerced the complainants recanting testimony The record indicated tha t defendant contacted the complainant four times by telephone followed her in her vehicle confronted her in the presence of her children and drove by her home The complainant testified that she was afraid that she agreed t o recant her trial testimony because she wanted no further contact with defendant and wanted him to stop harassing her Defendants conviction of assault with a dangerous weapon was affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Whether defendant revoked his waiver of rights and unambiguo usly requested an attorney Sufficiency of evidence to support convictions of seconddegree murder and felonyfirearm Whether defendant had a constitutional right to present witnesses at the preliminary examination Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Harris eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Gage Cavanagh and Wilder Since conduct and silence do not constitute an assertion of the righ t to remain silent the trial court did not err by admitting defendants statements made after he placed his hand over a question on the police officers statement form and told the officer dont write that After being informed of his Miranda rights before questioning began defendant chose to voluntarily answer questions Defendant answered the first nine questions however after initially answering the next question he put his hand over the question on the form and asked the officer not to write down his response because it was untruthful Defendant did not answer two more questions he was asked then informed the officer he would not answer any more questions and wanted an attorney Defendant claimed that his act of placing his hand over the statement form and telling the officer not to write down his response constituted an assertion of the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and revoked his previous waiver of that right The court disagreed because it was not until after the officer asked two subsequent questions that defendant verbally and unambiguously invoked hi s right to an attorney Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Sufficiency of evidence to convict of firstdegree felony mu rder and felonyfirearm Failure to instruct on lesser included offenses Distinction between lesser included offense and a cognate lesser included offense Prosecutorial misconduct Jury instructions on stricken testimony Ineffective assistance of counsel Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Williams eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Kelly Smolenski and Meter Even in the absence of direct evidence identifying defendant as the perpetrator the circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences from it were sufficient for the jury to conclude that defendant knew the victims daily routine of leaving for work about am knew of the victims habit of carrying large sums of money and thus shot and ultimately killed the victim while attempting to rob him At am the victims widow heard a gunshot discovered her husband outside with a gunshot in the neck and that his wallet was missing A neighbor saw defendant leave her house where he lived just before the shooting Another neighbor saw defendant walking very fast down the street right after the shooting A gunshot residue test performed about three hours after the shooting revealed that defendant had residue on his hands and that the residue came from a gun being fired Affirmed Full Text Opinion Employment Labor Law Back to

Judges Per Curiam Hood Doctoroff and Kelly Defendantspouse did not satisfy the exacting manifest disregard of the law standard required for judicial intervention in a property division award issued after binding arbitration and incorporated into the parties divorce judgment Defendant argued that the arbitration decision contained an award of spousal support in contravention of the settlement agreement The offending paragraph in the award actually provided for a lump sum payment or alimony in gross which was in the nature of the division of property and was completely consistent with the parties binding arbitr ation and settlement agreement The court also found no error with the arbitrato r s provision that if the sum certain awarded to plaintiff was not paid tha t amount would be

abolished the volunteer doctrine and agreed but for diffe rent reasons with the Court of Appeals that this doctrine did not bar plaintif f s claim and affirmed reversal of the trial courts grant of

rights when de fense counsel improperly referred to a fee agreement and improperly elicited testimony from police officers that had been excluded Court Michigan Court of Appeals Published Case Name Piccalo v Nix eJournal Number Judges Hood and McDonald Dissent Zahra The trial court erred in instructing the jury regarding the impairme nt defense because it would be absurd to allow the defense of

Plaintiff a passenger in a van where there were only two seats laid or sat in the back of the van and was injured by tire s inside the van when the driver an underage drinker who was served alcoh ol

liability action against defendant for injur ies sustained in a slip and fall in the parking lot of defendants bar was not preempted by the dramshop act Defendants service of alcohol was only implicated as it related to defendants knowledge of plaintiffs con dition and whether defendants conduct in failing to inspect or clear the park ing lot and failing to warn plaintiff was reasonable The trial court did not err in instructing the jury with both the general duty to business invitee instruction and the duty regarding natural accumulation of ice and snow instruction because the instructions are not inconsistent The jurys verdict denying all noneconomic damages was inadequate because the jury ignored an entire category of damages for which plaintiff produced uncontroverted

v Suttons Bay Twp Supervisor and McKeighan v Grass Lake Twp Supervisor II Court Michigan Supreme Court Case Name Tolksdorf v Griffith eJournal Number Judges Kelly Corrigan Cavanagh Weaver Taylor Young Jr Not participating Markman The court struck down the Private Roads Act allowing a private land owner to petition a township supervisor to open a private road across another landowners property as providing for an unconstitutional taking under art o of the Michigan Constitution of because it authorizes a taking that primarily benefits a private rather than a public purpose Plaintiffs owned landlocked property and defendants owned a neighboring parcel Defendants refused plaintiffs requests seeking a paved road acros s their parcel and an easement for utility lines Plaintiffs sued requesting a writ of mandamus compelling the township supervisor to proceed under the act The trial court ruled against plaintiffs and the Court of Appeals fou nd error in the refusal to issue the writ The court concluded that since the act gives individuals a permanent and continuous right to pass over anothers property it allowed a permanent physical occupation of private property by means of government action and was a taking The taking authorized by the act appeared to merely be an attempt by a private entity to use the states powers to acquire what it could not get through arms length negotiations with defendants and the primary benefit inured to the landlocked private owners rather than the public Reversed and the trial courts ruling for defendants was reinstated Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Whether plaintiffs prior recorded judgment lien had priorit y over defendants subsequent mortgage interest Court Michigan Court of Appeals Published Case Name Graves v American Acceptance Mortgage Corp eJournal Number Judges Gage Sawyer and Jansen Since the subsequent mortgage constituted a purchase money mortgage which takes priority over earlier creditors interests even though the earlier interest was duly recorded the trial court erred in concluding that plaintiffs earlier recorded judgment lien had priority over defendants mortgage interest The divorce judgment granted plaintiff a lien on the property to the extent of Diaz her exhusband then existing equitable title interest in the property as the land contract vendee The mortgage Diaz granted American Acceptance constituted a purchase money mortgage because Diaz who had defaulted on the land contract payments utilized th e mortgage proceeds to obtain legal title to the property by paying off the land contract vendors Accordingly notwithstanding that plaintiff filed h er judgment lien before the execution of the Diaz mortgage the purchase mone y mortgage by which Diaz secured legal title to the property had priority over plaintiffs judgment lien which arose against Diaz prior to his acquisition of title to the real estate The trial court failed to accord defendants purchase money mortgage interest the priority to which it was entitled by law Reversed and remanded Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Municipal Issues Circuit court

owners site plan for a McDonalds resta urant because the decision to deny approval of the plan involved discretionary authority and was supported by competent material and substantial evidence The trial court erred by issuing a writ of mandamus instead of a n order for superintending control but this was not the basis for reversal Plaintiffs site plan only provided for stacking spaces but were required for plaintiffs to have two drivethrough windows This nonconformance with the zoning ordinance alone was sufficient for defendan ts to deny the site plan Defendants also found that the

Motions to quash the informations regarding the crime of rio t The constitutionality of the riot statute Court Michigan Court of Appeals Published Case Name People v Kim eJournal Number Judges Saad Holbrook Jr and McDonald Since the evidence established that the defendants acted in concert with others to engage in violent conduct which caused or created a serious risk of causing public terror and harm and there was ample evidence establishing probable cause that each defendant participated in the rush toward police and in throwing projectiles the district courts properly bound over defendants on the crime of riot and the circuit court erred in quashing t he informations The defendants claimed and the circuit court agreed that since the violent acts were directed at and witnessed by the police and because police officers are not members of the public the defendants acts did not cause public terror or alarm The court has observed that a defendant causes public terror or alarm any time a segment of the public i s put in fear of injury either to their persons or their property and concluded that the statute also applies to violent conduct that creates a serious risk of causing public alarm Reversed with the charges of riot reinstated and remanded Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Insufficient evidence to support conviction of felonyfirear m Remedy

eJournal Number Judges Meter Cavanagh and Talbot Defendants conviction for felonyfirearm in connection with CSC I was reversed and vacated because there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant penetrated the victim on that occasion However while the prosecutor could not retry defendant on that identical felonyfirearm charge retrial using the applicable predicate offense assault with intent to commit CSC II was permitted The trial court did n ot abuse its discretion in admitting a photograph of the victims buttocks because evidence that defendant carried the photograph in his wallet had probative value to show that the victims allegations were true and tha t he had a motive The trial court also did not err in finding that the victim s sevenyear old brother was competent to testify Reversal was not warrante d by various instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct Except for the felonyfirearm conviction and sentence defendants convictions and sentences were affirmed The case was remanded for a new trial on felonyfirearm Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Motion for rehearing or reconsideration of denial of motion to transfer prosecution of defendant from juvenile to adult status Discretionary transfer and mandatory transfer provisions of USC o Taylor v United States Court US District Court Eastern District of Michigan Case Name United States v AFF eJournal Number Judges Lawson The governments motion for rehearing or reconsideration of the c ourts decision denying the motion to transfer prosecution of defendant from juvenile to adult status was denied because the government failed to show a defect by which the court was misled or which upon correction would lead to a different result The governments argument that the mandatory tra nsfer provision of the statute applied to defendant was not raised in a proper o r timely fashion and in any event defendants prior conviction of seconddegree home invasion did not place him within the scope of that provision The court determined that defendants crime of seconddegree home invasion involving his breaking into a house with the intent to commit larceny did not contain an element of actual or threatened use of physica l force against the person of another and therefore was not a predicate offense for mandatory transfer Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Waiver of right to be present during voir dire Whether the re was a sufficient connection to interstate commerce to convict defendants of RICO violations and violence in furtherance of racketeering United States v Lopez Whether a de minimis connection to interstate commerce is sufficien t to convict Whether o violent crimes in aid of racketeering is controlled by Lopez Court US Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit Case Name United States v Riddle eJournal Number Judges Norris Guy and Siler A trial court is not required to engage a defendant in an ontherec ord colloquy before allowing the defendant to absent himself from voir dire and a failure to do so is not a fundamental structural error Therefore defendants waiver through their counsel of their right to be present duri ng voir dire was effective Defense counsel suggested defendants absence an d the district court allowed the waiver only after it instructed defense counsel to consult with their clients and then received assurance from defense counsel that defendants waived their right to be present Defendants absence was part of a defense strategy to avoid any prejudice resulting from the appearance of heavy security during the questioning of the potential jurors Even if the waiver were not effective the right to be present at voir dire is not one of those structural rights whose violation constitutes per se error Rather there must be prejudice in the absence t o warrant reversal Affirmed Full Text Opinion Employment Labor Law Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Civil Rights Issues Title

costs of contaminated property when calculating the amount of just compensation due a property owner in a condemnation proceeding The court also held that the only proper method of arriving at just

Published Case Name Stitt v Holland Abundant Life Fellowship eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Hoekstra Griffin and Bandstra Defense counsels repeated attempts to introduce evidence relating to the illumination of plaintiffs counsels parking lot despite the trial court s having ruled the evidence inadmissible did not warrant reversal of the tri al court judgment of no cause of action Although plaintiffs objected to each of the instances complained of on appeal all but one of those objections was sustained and no further relief was requested The court could not conclude that questions of counsel which were not answered constituted misconduct requiring reversal when plaintiffs neither requested that the jury be instructed that questions of counsel were not evidence nor requested a mistrial However the award of offer of judgment sanctions against plaintiffs was reversed under the interest of justice exception Unusual circumstances existed in this case because of the unsettled

the trial court erred in refusin g to default the defendant or prevent him from presenting a defense based on the failure to follow the requirement of o e that a defendant shall file an affidavit of meritorious defense Whether the defendants failure to file a n affidavit of meritorious defense deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction Court Michigan Court of Appeals Published Case Name Wilhelm v Mustafa eJournal Number Judges Collins Jansen and Zahra Defendants failure to timely file an affidavit of meritorious defens e did not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying plaintiffs motion seeking to sanction the defendant by entering a default or by precluding the defendant from presenting a defense Although the requirement that a defendant file a n affidavit of meritorious defense is mandatory the statute does not indicat e that default is the mandatory or even appropriate remedy where a defendan t fails to file the affidavit Plaintiff did not raise the issue of the defendants failure to file the affidavit until the first day of trial The trial court could have sanctioned both partiesdefendant for not filing th e affidavit of meritorious defense in a timely manner and plaintiff for not including her procedural defense in the final pretrial order A courts subject matter jurisdiction is determined only by reference to the allegations in the complaint It was apparent from the allegations in plaintiffs complaint that the negligence alleged was within the class of cases

premises liability case because the evidence indicated that the oil spot plaintiff slipped and fell on was of the nature of a condition commonly fou nd in ordinary parking lots Opting to allow it to naturally absorb into the asphalt was not an unreasonable response Defendant did not by unreasonabl e action or inaction create a dangerous condition in the parking lot To withstand defendants motion for summary disposition plaintiff had to establish that defendant had notice of the condition but plaintiff present ed no direct evidence indicating how or when the oil was spilled onto the parking lot The only evidence plaintiff offered to show that defendant kne w or should have known of the oil spot was her testimony that the oil was bla ck and had spread to a diameter of two and a half feet

Daughtrey Moore Cole Cla y and Gilman Dissent Kennedy Boggs Norris Suhrheinrich Siler and Batc helder Plaintiffs stated a claim for securities fraud by creating a str ong inference that defendants projected financial wellbeing at a time when they had actual knowledge that their statements were false or misleading while knowingly omitting material facts that would have tempered their optimism Plaintiffs allegations suggested that it must have become ob vious that the impact of the Balanced Budget Act would be adverse to defendantcorporation a health care provider yet defendants persisted in making favorable predictions and feigning ignorance of the Acts potent ial negative impact on earnings The district courts order dismissing plai ntiff s action for failure to state a claim was

Unpublished Case Name Anchrum v Airtouch Cellular eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Zahra Smolenski and Gage Plaintiffs claim that she was terminated from employment based on r ace failed as a matter of law because she did not present evidence suggesting that any similarly situated nonAfricanAmerican employee was treated differently for the same or similar conduct Plaintiff was terminated allegedly because she failed to provide documentation of coaching sessions she was required to perform with her direct employees Defendantemployer claimed plaintiff was unable to confirm the coaching sessions took place Plaintiff noted that one Caucasian supervisor was merely written up for failing to coach her employees However there was no evidence that any of the other supervisors were ever believed to have falsified coaching report s Further defendants met their burden of presenting a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for plaintiffs discharge when they asserted that she was terminated because she was believed to have falsified the coaching reports and plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut that claim Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks This summary also

established that he was substantially limited in his ability to perform manual tasks the full task rotation was not an essential job function and plaintiff was otherwise qualified a nd defendant failed to provide reasonable accommodation Plaintiff allege d that defendant improperly used its concept of job rotation under which ea ch member of a work team rotated through each of the jobs assigned to the tea m to justify its refusal to place him on any team assigned one or more tasks he could not perform in violation of the ADA Once the jury determined tha t full task rotation was not an essential job function as alleged by defendant and plaintiff was otherwise qualified the jury could have reasonably determined that given the imperfect implementation of the job rotation system defendants de facto requirement that only restricted employees be fully functionalfully rotational was unreasonable The jury could have reasonably concluded that the hardship of accommodating plainti

infliction of emotional distress but evidence presented at trial on plaintiffAnthony Suduls o claim was legally sufficient to suppor t a jury finding that the force defendants used during his arrest

its discretion i n determining that defendants were not entitled to a new trial on either Anthony Suduls o claim or his assault and battery claim Affirmed in part reversed in part and remanded for

did not preclude the ruling the trial court erred in concluding that defendants failure to secure financing was excused by the defense of impossibility Defendants failure to secure financing was reasonably foreseeable and terms of the parties contrac t indicated that they had expressly considered and contemplated that possibility However given the equities of the case the trial court did not err when it granted defendants the right to recover their dow n payment despite the terms of the contracts liquidated damages clause Plaintiff was granted the right to sell the house which had increased in value during the period between the contract and the lawsuit The trial court also incorrectly ruled that plaintiff was barred from further suit b y res judicata and collateral estoppel

offender in the custody of the Family Independence Agency FIA Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Bonaroti eJournal Number Judges Memorandum Jansen Zahra and Owens Placement of

property over he was warned to attend school and not get suspended After the juvenile transferred schools to get out of troubl e he was suspended twice within the first month The juvenile also had failing grades and was well below his grade level in reading The trial court did not abuse its discretion in placing the juvenile with the FIA Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Sufficient evidence to support conviction of felonious assa ult Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Baskin eJournal Number Judges Memorandum Jansen Zahra and Owens The trial courts findings in defendants bench trial resulti ng in his conviction of felonious assault were sufficient to support defendants conviction Although the trial court was unable to completely accept the testimony of any of the witnesses and acquitted defendant on five of the six charges against him it found that defendant struck the victim in the head with a baseball bat That finding was amply supported by the evidence which did not clearly weigh in defendants favor A baseball bat when used to inflict injury can constitute a dangerous weapon Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Entrapment Prosecutorial misconduct Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Gilders eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Fitzgerald and Markey The trial court properly found that the undercover officer did nothi ng but offer defendant the opportunity to commit the crime and defendant was not entrapped by the undercover officers conduct Defendant argued that he on ly wanted to purchase one ounce of cocaine and that the officers conduct in refusing to deal in any amount less than two ounces was entrapment The officer put the word out on the street that he had cocaine for sale but would not sell less than two ounces Defendant contacted the officer numerous times to make a deal His problem was not that he did not want tw o ounces but that he could not afford two ounces at once After obtaining sufficient cash to complete a twoounce transaction the defendant did not hesitate to contact the officer The evidence did not indicate that the us e of a twoounce minimum was intended as a means to enhance possible sentences The conduct of the police was not so outrageous that it overcam e the will of defendant Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Circuit court jurisdiction Prosecutors charging proced ure Amendment of information to reinstate charges District court refusal to bind over solely on basis it disbelieved the complainants testimony at the preliminary examination Sentencing Response to challenges to PSIR Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Rivera eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Fitzgerald and Markey Although somewhat irregular the prosecutors procedures in this matter provided the circuit court with jurisdiction over each of the charged crimes The circuit court possessed jurisdiction to join the misdemeanor assault charge pending before the district court which was reduced after preliminary examination from a charge of assault with intent to commit murder with the felony kidnapping charge pending before the circuit court Defendant identified no authority or rationale that would deny the circuit court jurisdiction over a separately charged misdemeanor arising from the same criminal act or occurrence as felony charges already pending in the circuit court The circuit courts amendment of the information to rein state charges dismissed by the district court after the preliminary examination also did not constitute unfair surprise Defendants conviction and sentence was affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Other acts evidence Application of the VanderVliet test Ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to challenge competency of sevenyear old to testify Proportionality of sentence of to months imprisonment for CSC III Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Stoutmiles eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Collins Hokestra and Gage Evidence of a previous sexual act that defendant allegedly committed against a sevenyear old was properly admitted because it met each prong of the VanderVliet test The evidence was offered for a proper purpose to sh ow a scheme or plan by defendant to commit the crime in his living room despi te the presence of others Defendants theory was that the victim was fabricating the accusations The evidence was relevant because it made defendants guilt more probable than it would have been without the evidence Since defendant had previously committed unlawful sexual acts in his crowded living room it was not implausible for him to have performed similar acts on the complainant under similar circumstances The evidence s probative value was not substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice and the trial court gave a limiting instruction Defendants conviction and sentence were affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Withdrawal of guilty plea Effect of deferral of acceptance of plea pending review of a not yet prepared presentence report Fed R Crim P e A fair and just reason for withdrawal of plea Court US Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit Case Name United States v Mader eJournal Number Judges Krupansky Boggs and Batchelder Defendant had to provide a fair and just reason to support withdrawa l of his guilty plea even though that plea had not yet been accepted by the district court and he failed to do so At the plea hearing the district court deferred acceptance of the plea and the plea agreement pending revie w of a not yet prepared presentence report Contrary to defendants argum ent that did not allow him to withdraw the plea without any justification Defendants contention that he had a fair and just reason to withdraw h is plea was also unavailing Defendant knew at the time of the plea hearing that the gun that he ostensibly sold to the eventual murderer of a police officer had jammed at the scene of that shooting and was not the gun that killed the officer The only new information in the presentence report was the governments admission that defendant did not sell that gun directl y to the murderer Denial of defendants motion to withdraw his plea was aff irmed Full Text Opinion Employment Labor Law Back to Quicklinks This

Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Breon eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Murphy and Meter The family court did not clearly error in terminating respondentfat hers parental rights because several factors demonstrated that without regard to intent he could not provide proper care for the children and would not be able to do so within a reasonable time A foster care worker testified that respondent was dismissed from a drug treatment program because of a relapse and an altercation with a worker The foster care worker also testified that respondent failed to complete the aftercare portion of another drug treatment program failed to provide documentation regarding parenting classes and had inadequate housing Respondent admitted that he had inadequate housing and failed to provide documentatio n of compliance with his treatment plan Affirmed Full Text Opinion Litigation Back to Quicklinks Issues Res judicata Court Michigan Court of Appeals

effect of an arbitration order entered in an earlie r case and that this suit was barred by the doctrine of res judicata Both actions were based on the same occurrence and since the defendant in this action was president of the defendantcorporation in the prior action the defendants were essentially the same This action did not allege a new bas is for liability and the claim against the builders

party Court US Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit Case Name Groner v Golden Gate Gardens Apartments eJournal Number Judges Gilman Siler and Duggan Deciding an issue of first impression in the circuit the court held that a plaintiff in a Fair Housing Act case has the burden of proof to establish the reasonableness of a proposed accommodation Since landlordGolden Gate had a legitimate interest in ensuring the quiet enjoyment of all its tenants and there was no showing of a reasonable accommodation that would have enabled the plaintiff who suffered from schizophrenia and depression to remain in his apartment without significantly disturbing another tenant plaintiff failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to a violation of his rights under either the Fair Housing Act or the equivalen t state laws Plaintiff allegedly screamed and slammed doors within his apartment causing the tenant in the apartment above his to make repeated complaints to Golden Gates manager The parties attempted unsuccessfully to resolve the issue over a period of time during which Golden Gate soundproofed plaintiffs front door and attempted to work with his social worker to resolve plaintiffs behavior Affirmed Full Text Opinion Constitutional Law Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Media Law Issues The First Amendment right of the press to gather information Whether the court clerk could grant access to identity of trial jurors Court US District Court Eastern District of Michigan Case Name In re Bay City Times eJournal Number Judges Lawson Since the subject of the request release of the names and communiti es of residence of the trial jurors in the underlying criminal case constituted matters which were already in the public record and releasing the information would not unduly infringe on the jurors privacy interests th e court granted the petitionernewspapers request The underlying criminal case involved the former superintendent of the city wastewater treatment plant The jury returned a verdict on the charges of violation of the Clea n Water Act During voir dire each prospective juror announced his or her na me and community of residence The trial attracted the attention of the local media After the verdict was returned a reporter requested the names of t he trial jurors from the court clerk Thereafter petitioner requested an order for the disclosure of the jurors names and communities of residence but not their telephone numbers or home addresses The request was measure d and confined to matters within the public record and its disclosure would not compromise juror privacy Full Text Opinion Criminal Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Order compelling defendant to produce reports created by his expert witnesses when no such reports were created or existed MCR Trial courts authority to modify the court rules Court Michigan Court of Appeals Published Case Name People v Phillips eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Holbrook Jr Hood and Griffin The trial court erred in ordering defendant to disclose to the prose cutor reports created by his expert witnesses when no such reports were created or existed and the prosecutor was not entitled to the unwritten observations of defendants expert witnesses The plain language of the applicable court rule provided only that reports produced by defendant s experts were subject to disclosure and reports necessarily meant only written reports that have actually been produced The court held that ther e is no requirement for an expert to create a physical report and an expert may testify based solely on observations obtained at trial The trial cour t also did not show why good cause existed to modify the court rule in this case Reversed and remanded Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Writ of habeas corpus pursuant to o Right to a timely parole violation hearing Granting or rescinding of good time sentence credits D ue process Michigan Department of Corrections MDOC Court US District Court Eastern District of Michigan Case Name Moore v Hofbauer eJournal Number Judges Tarnow Petitioners request for a writ of habeas corpus was denied and t he petition dismissed because his parole revocation hearing was held within a reasonable time after he was taken into custody and he was not improperly denied or deprived good time credits Although petitioners revocation hearing occurred days after he was available for MDOC custody instead of the days provided by state statute the hearing was held within a reasonable time The hearing held within two months after petitioner was taken into custody on the parole violator warrant was presumptively reasonably timely and petitioner failed to show prejudice The warden s decision not to grant petitioner good time credits for the period during which petitioner tested positive for controlled substances and was a parol e absconder was a reasonable exercise of discretion Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Admissibility of victims statements about abuse to police o fficer and her mother Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Denton eJournal Number Judges Memorandum McDonald Smolenski and Kelly Although the trial court abused its discretion in allowing a police officer to testify under MRE as to what the victim told her about the abus e the officers testimony was admissible under MRE dB to rebut an implied charge of recent fabrication or improper motive on the part of the victim The evidence did not fall within the excited utterance exception t o the hearsay rule because the statements were neither spontaneous nor made while the victim was still under the influence of the excitement caused by the abuse Defendants trial theory was that the victim had fabricated the alleged abuse and had lied because she resented his attempts to discipline her The victims prior consistent statement tended to rebut those claims Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Sentencing of a second habitual offender Jurisdiction to resentence defendant Applicability of MCL MSA Right to a speedy trial and delayed sentencing Proportionality of sentence Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Phillips eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam White Cavanagh and Talbot Defendants sentence as a second habitual offender was supported by the facts of the case and his age and his ineligibility for disciplinary credits as an habitual offender which meant that he had to serve his enti re minimum sentence before becoming eligible for parole did not negate that Defendants argument that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to resentence him failed because the statute upon which he relied did not app ly to his case and even if it did there was good cause for the delay From the time leave was denied by the Supreme Court sentencing was delayed for approximately one year and four months Defendant filed a motion to quash resentencing that caused resentencing to be adjourned and after the motio n was heard and denied resentencing took place within days Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Habitual offender charge based on prior conviction that was a felony and at time of OUIL conviction constituted a misdemeanor Ineffective assistance of counsel Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Piotrowski eJournal Number Judges Memorandum Jansen Zahra and Owens The trial court did not err by using defendants prior conviction to convict him as a second habitual offender because the offense is now classified a s a misdemeanor Defendant claimed that use of the prior conviction in this manner violated the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Michiga n Constitutions The court disagreed and affirmed defendants conviction as a second habitual offender and the sentence imposed pursuant to that conviction A sentencing court may use a prior conviction of a crime that was classified as a felony at the time it was committed to enhance the sentence for a subsequent felony conviction even though the prior crime h as been reclassified as a misdemeanor Defendants prior conviction of failin g to return rental property was a felony at the time he committed the offense therefore the trial court properly used it to sentence him as a second habitual offender Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues The trial courts refusal to accept guilty plea Whether the trial court may reject pleas to reduced charges Waiver Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Winbush eJournal Number Judges Memorandum McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court did not commit reversible error when it refused to a ccept defendants guilty plea to a probation violation The petition charging defendant with probation violation contained six allegations The prosecutor indicated that if defendant pleaded guilty to one allegation she would drop the others The trial court disapproved of that procedure and required the parties to proceed with a hearing A defendant does not have an absolute right to have a guilty plea accepted and the court may reject a plea in the exercise of its sound discretion The trial court may also reject pleas to reduced charges Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Motion to dismiss based on the grounds that defendants s tatements were not true threats and therefore were protected speech Knowingly transmitting a threat to kidnap in interstate commerce in violation of USC o c Knowingly transmitting a threat to injure in interstate commerce in violation of o c Making interstate telephone calls that were lewd indecent obscene and lascivious with the intent to abuse harass and annoy another person in violation of USC o aA and B Court US Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit Case Name United States v Landham eJournal Number Judges Suhrheinrich Moore and Edmunds The district court erred in failing to dismiss Count Three of the indictment alleging that defendant knowingly transmitted a threat to kidna p in interstate commerce The statement You will not have Priscilla by her second birthday because Im going to have all your children You will not have Priscilla to raise Im going to get her contained no communication containing a direct threat to kidnap nor would a reasonable observer in the victims shoes perceive it as an indirect threat The defendant and the victim were embroiled in a divorce proceeding The victi m had obtained a Domestic Violence Order removing defendant from the home an d barring him from contact with his daughter Defendants statement Im going to get her in context referred to the custody battle during the divorce proceeding There was no allegation that defendant had ever attempted to abduct the child in the past Defendant could not have legall y been charged with kidnapping since Priscilla was his biological daughter a nd his parental rights had not been terminated Defendants convictions we re reversed and remanded Full Text Opinion Family Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights Whether petitioner made reas onable attempts to reunify the family Sufficiency of the referees findings Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Balowski eJournal Number Judges Memorandum McDonald Smolenski and Kelly Although respondentfather complied with some aspects of the parent agency agreement the trial court did not clearly err in finding that the statuto ry grounds for termination were established by clear and convincing evidence and that the evidence did not show that termination of respondents parent al rights was clearly not in the childrens best interests Respondent claime d that petitioner failed to make reasonable efforts to reunify the family however those deficiencies did not involve the principal issue leading to termination which was respondents failure to successfully address his substance abuse problem Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights under oo bg and j Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re DJH eJournal Number Judges Memorandum Collins Hoekstra and Gage The trial court did not err in concluding that clear and convincing evidence supported termination of respondentmothers parental rights The recor d showed that respondent and her children shared a close bond However it also showed that respondent continued to have contact with and marry her boyfriend after she knew of his violent tendencies and that he likely injured her children and after the court ordered that he have no contact with the children Although respondent later divorced her husband and testified that she was no longer involved with him other trial testimony indicated that she did continue to be involved with him The trial court s findings indicated that it did not credit respondents testimony and t he court found nothing in the record to suggest that the trial court clearly erred in that regard Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights under oo bbi bii g and j Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re MJCR eJournal Number Judges Memorandum Holbrook Jr Hood and Griffin Even if the family court erred in terminating respondentmothers parental rights under o bg the error was harmless because the remaining statutory grounds with regard to her were established with clear and convincing evidence The evidence indicated that the mother was in a position where she should have known of the sexual abuse of her daughter b y her husband respondentfather her daughters stepfather She was well aware of the physical abuse of both children by the father yet continued to reside with him exposing the children to further abuse The mother also h ad a history of emotional and psychological problems including several suici de attempts in front of the children Termination of both respondents par ental rights was affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights under oo bd and j W hether respondentfailure to fulfill the terms of a transition plan to regain custody due to the lack of necessary help and referrals Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Roe eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Doctoroff Saad and Wilder There was clear and convincing evidence that respondentmother faile d to comply with the placement and transition plan to regain custody of the minor child after the child was placed in a limited guardianship Although respondent did eventually complete parenting classes and undergo a psychiatric examination she failed to secure adequate housing for the child did not demonstrate any financial ability to support the child did not participate in counseling and did not take her medications for a diagnosed psychotic disorder There was no merit to respondents claim that her failure to fulfill the terms of the plan was the fault of the probate court Termination of respondents parental rights under both statutory grounds relied upon by the family court was affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights under oo bci g a nd j Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Walker eJournal Number Judges Memorandum White Cavanagh and Talbot The family court did not clearly error in terminating respondentmot hers parental rights because the statutory bases for termination were established by clear and convincing evidence Respondent failed to substantially comply with the treatment plan and work toward reunification with her children Respondent failed to obtain and maintain suitable housing for herself and the children and showed an inability to control a nd supervise the children resulting in harm to them She did not interact wi th the children during visitation she failed to obtain and

petitioners property was not supported by competent materia l and substantial evidence on the record since petitioner presented no evidence of the true cash value of the property under any of the

because he did not at the relevant time appear on a register of eligible civil service employees and that he had been removed from the register after one year under a documented civil service regulation Plaintiff did not substantiate that either defendant secretly removed his name from the register and the affidavits he presented from other prior litigants against defendants did not refute

Full Text Opinion Criminal Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Jury instruction on negligent homicide as a lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter Trial courts failure to give instruction sua sponte Waiver Ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to request instruction or object to its omission Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Bridgewater eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Bandstra Gage and Wilder Although the trial courts failure to read the jury instruction o n negligent homicide as a lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughte r was error defense counsels affirmative withdrawal of the requested instruction and subsequent approval of the instructions given constituted a waiver of the issue The court also concluded that defense counsels decision to drop the request was sound trial strategy and even if the decision constituted deficient representation it did not prejudice defendant to the extent that the outcome of the trial would have been different The prosecution presented eyewitness testimony from two nonpolice witnesses establishing that defendant was traveling between and miles per hour disobeyed a red traffic signal and collided with t he minivan in which one of the victims was traveling Defendants convicti ons were affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Remedy for noncompliance with discovery order Dismissal of charges Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Byars eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the charges agai nst defendants with prejudice as a remedy for the police departments failu re to comply with a discovery order While it appeared that the department h ad no valid excuse for failing to comply in a timely manner many of the documents were provided about a month after the officer in charge received the order Defense counsel stated at that time that although he had not reviewed the documents in detail they appeared to include everything he needed to investigate his entrapment claim There was no showing that the late arrival of the documents prejudiced defendant who was out on bond a nd it was unclear what relevance they had in determining whether he was entrapped The more severe remedy of dismissal was not appropriate where a continuance would have alleviated any harm to defendants case Reverse d and remanded Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Ineffective assistance of counsel Sufficient evidence to s upport conviction of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Ferguson eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Doctoroff Cavanagh and Meter Contrary to defendants contention that his counsel was ineffecti ve for advising him not to testify on his own behalf the transcript revealed tha t defendant chose not to testify and there was no evidence that counsel persuaded him to refrain from testifying The evidence presented at trial amply supported the trial courts findings of fact and ultimate conclus ion of guilt Testimony supported the inference that the victim was worried about defendant seeing her with another man and that defendant shot her after he saw her with witnessReese The testimony also established a timeline that contradicted defendants claim in his police statement th at the shooting was accidental Defendants convictions were affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Loss of evidence before a defense request for its productio n Admission of evidence regarding defendants passenger Ineffective assistance of counsel Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Knott eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam White Cavanagh and Talbot The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant s motion to dismiss on the basis that she was denied a fair trial due to the police departments bad faith failure to save the videotape of her arrival at the station where the alleged assault occurred The tapes were destroyed as pa rt of the policy and procedure of the police department and not purposefully to destroy evidence for a forthcoming trial At the hearing on defendants motion to dismiss and at trial both officers testified that the recycling of tapes was a matter of policy and procedure Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Denial of motion to suppress the evidence Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Minge eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam White Cavanagh and Talbot Defendants motion to suppress was properly denied because the po lice stop of her vehicle was justified where the evidence gave rise to more than a hunch that defendant was involved in criminal activity Defendant was observed going into a house where police believed cocaine was being sold a police officer saw another person approach the same door and exchange mone y for suspected cocaine with a man inside the house and defendant came out the same door with a visible bulge under her shirt Based on the police officers experience in narcotics enforcement he believed that defenda nt was taking drugs from the suspected drug house where he had just observed a suspected drug transaction Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Ineffective assistance of counsel Joint representation MCR F Alleged impermissible comment by prosecutor on defendants silence Prosecutorial misconduct Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Williams eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Markey McDonald and Kelly Defendant failed to establish that he received ineffective assistanc e of counsel Since defendant and his brother stated clearly on the record that they desired to proceed with the same attorney and did not believe there would be a conflict of interest failed to identify an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected his lawyers performance and both defendants presented the identical defense The trial court raised the iss ue and explained to defendants that each had a right to his own attorney and that using the same attorney gave rise to the possibility of conflicting defenses Defendant personally made an informed waiver of his right to hav e separate counsel This waiver extinguished any error and precluded defenda nt from raising the issue on appeal Affirmed Full Text Opinion Employment Labor Law Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Negligence Intentional Tort Issues Defamation action by former employee Whether claim was pre empted by federal labor law Sufficient evidence to sustain each element of defamation claim Damages Absolute privilege Qualified privilege Jury instructions regarding actual malice and reckless disregard Motion for directed verdict or JNOV Whether plaintiffs counsel argued facts not in evidence Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Slawick v Detroit Newspaper Agency eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Griffin Jansen and Gage Plaintiffformer employees defamation claim was not preempted by federal labor law because defendant used the CBA solely as a defense to the claim contending that publication of the discharge letter to the union president was absolutely privileged The letter of discharge accused plaintiff of throwing liquid substances on security personnel Reviewing the record th e court determined that the jury could have found that defendant acted with actual malice in disseminating the discharge letter There was evidence at trial that the contents of the discharge letter were made with reckless disregard for the truth The trial court did not err in denying defendant s motion for a directed verdict or JNOV Evidence supported the jurys aw ard of for noneconomic damages for exemplary damages and in economic damages Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears

the initial dispositional hearing Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Guy eJournal Number Judges Memorandum McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court did not err in terminating respondentfathers pa rental rights at the initial dispositional hearing The petition contained a proper request for termination and the family court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the child came under its jurisdiction The family court also did not clearly err in finding by clear and convincing evidence that one or more of the facts alleged in the petition were true and justified termination of parental rights Respondent had a lengthy criminal history multiple incidents of domestic violence longstanding drug and alcohol abuse longterm failure to parent the chil d and failed to comply with the court ordered plan developed as part of a guardianship proceeding Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights under oo baii g i and j Best interests of the child Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Jones eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam White Cavanagh and Talbot Respondentmothers parental rights to her minor child were prope rly terminated because the asserted statutory grounds for termination were established by clear and convincing evidence Respondents parental rig hts to her three other children were previously terminated as a consequence o f her drug use and her failure to rehabilitate and she continued to use dru gs during her pregnancy with the minor causing the minor to be born addicted to crack cocaine Respondent continued to abuse drugs after the minors birth did not set forth a meaningful plan to provide for the minors c are her housing arrangements were transient and she had not maintained employment for a significant duration of time Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights based on oo bci g j and kiii Alleged bias of trial court Jurisdiction over minor child Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Pittao eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam White Cavanagh and Talbot The family court did not clearly err in finding that the statutory g rounds for termination were established by clear and convincing evidence The respondentfathers claim that during the proceedings he was essentially on trial for the murder of his wife was unpersuasive The trial court specifically indicated in its findings that it did not consider respondent s wifes murder The trial court also indicated in detail the factors on whi ch it relied including respondents failure to address his substance abuse a nd domestic violence issues his lack of credibility and his failure to comp ly with the case treatment plan The evidence did not show that termination o f respondents parental rights was clearly not in the childs best interests Affirmed Full Text Opinion Insurance Back to Quicklinks Issues Whether the loss payable clause in the insurance policy was an ordinary or a standard loss payable clause Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Van Reken v Michigan Basic Property Ins Assn eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Doctoroff Cavanagh and Meter The loss payable clause covering plaintiffsland contract vendors i nterest in the property was clearly an ordinary loss payable clause because it provided for payment to the insuredland contract vendees and plaintiffs as their interests may appear without any additional language providing tha t plaintiffs would be protected from loss based on any act or neglect of the insured Defendant issued an insurance policy for the property naming the vendees as the insureds and plaintiffs were listed under a loss payable clause Accordingly plaintiffs right of recovery was no greater than tha t of the vendees Because the policys theft and intentional act provisions clearly precluded the vendees from recovering plaintiffs were also precluded from recovering The trial court should have denied plaintiffs motion for summary disposition and granted defendants motion for summary disposition Reversed and remanded Full Text Opinion Litigation Back to Quicklinks Issues Motion to strike supplemental witness list Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Moton v Oakwood Healthcare Inc eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting plaintiffs motion to strike defendants supplemental witness list There was no evidence indicating a mutual agreement to postpone discovery and while plaintiffs deposition was delayed that did not explain defendants failure to con duct timely discovery from plaintiffs treating physicians and coworkers Defendant failed to adequately explain its delay in obtaining the private investigators material Defendant argued that the trial court should h ave accepted the supplemental witness list because defendant explicitly reserv ed the right to amend its original list However the court held that allowin g parties to circumvent the rules by claiming a reservation of rights would defeat the purpose and authority of the court rules Affirmed Full Text Opinion Municipal Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Real Property Issues Zoning variance Zoning Board of Appeals ZBA Interpretat ion of the applicable township ordinance and whether the ordinance prevented the building of a singlefamily residence on lot in question Whether the circuit court properly analyzed the ZBAs denial of a variance Selfcr eated hardship Taking Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Domine v Township of Grosse Ile eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Doctoroff Cavanagh and Meter The circuit court erred in reversing the ZBAs decision to deny a variance because competent material and substantial evidence supported the ZBA s decision Plaintiffs property did not conform to the zoning ordinance because it failed to meet the lot size requirements While this was a practical difficulty inherent in the property itself this practical difficulty could have been avoided if plaintiff had not decided to sell th e second lot separately Plaintiff not the zoning ordinance could reasonab ly be deemed to have caused the practical difficulty Consideration of the effect of the requested variance on others and on the character of the subdivision was also appropriate Reversed and the decision of ZBA was reinstated Full Text Opinion Negligence Intentional Tort Back to Quicklinks Issues Whether plaintiffs claim was barred by the firemans rule Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Berry v John Carlo Inc eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court properly granted summary disposition to the defendantdredging contractor because it was undisputed that defendants a ct of blocking the road with dredged material took place prior to plaintiffpolice officer beginning his park patrol activities Plaintiff w as injured as his car hit a pile of dredged material left on the closed road by defendant and the car became airborne Plaintiff claimed that defendant acted in a grossly negligent manner by placing the dredged material on th e road and by failing to place proper warning devices around the material T he firemans rule applied because the defendants conduct of which plaintiff complained occurred prior to the commencement of plaintiffs patrol and arrival on the road and was not unrelated to plaintiffs reason for being at the location where the collision occurred The area where plaintiff was injured was closed due to defendants activities and his duties included checking the area for trespassers Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Negligence Intentional destruction of relevant evidence S anctions Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Garrison v Mount Clemens Gen Hosp eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Hood and Smolenski The trial court properly held that plaintiffs failed to present any evidence to show that defendanthospital was negligent or was responsible for defendantReids conduct where plaintiff was injured outside the hospital when he was struck by Reids car which rolled into him while unattended The evidence showed that Reid left the car without setting the parking brake and the car rolled down the drive and hit plaintiff However the gearshift was found in neutral the key was not in the ignition and Reid had taken her keys inside and given them to the desk nurse Although defense experts concluded that the key had to be in the ignition for the c ar to travel along the path it took there was no evidence supporting the experts conjecture plaintiff offered none and the experts themselves could not explain how the key could have been in the ignition if it was with the desk nurse Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Premises liability Open and obvious doctrine Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Girard v Dearborn Cinemas eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly Since plaintiff admitted that he had specific knowledge of the ladde rs defective condition where the safety latches that extended the ladder had been removed and in their place a piece of rope had been tied to two rungs and he knew that the

plaintiffs counsel argued facts not in evidence Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Slawick v Detroit Newspaper Agency eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Griffin Jansen and Gage Plaintiffformer employees defamation claim was not preempted by federal labor law because defendant used the CBA solely as a defense to the claim contending that publication of the discharge letter to the union president was absolutely privileged The letter of discharge accused plaintiff of throwing liquid substances on security personnel Reviewing the record th e court determined that the jury could have found that defendant acted with actual malice in disseminating the discharge letter There was evidence at trial that the contents of the discharge letter were made with reckless disregard

Selfcr eated hardship Taking Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Domine v Township of Grosse Ile eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Doctoroff Cavanagh and Meter The circuit court erred in reversing the ZBAs decision to deny a variance because competent material and substantial evidence supported the ZBA s decision Plaintiffs property did not conform to the zoning ordinance because it failed to meet the lot size requirements While this was a practical difficulty inherent in the property itself this practical difficulty could have been avoided if plaintiff had not decided to sell th e second lot separately Plaintiff not the zoning ordinance could reasonab ly be deemed to have caused the practical difficulty Consideration of the effect of the requested variance on

Name Michigan United Conservation Clubs v Secretary of State eJournal Number Judges OConnell McDonald and Meter Plaintiffs were denied a writ of mandamus ordering defendants to rej ect a petition for referendum on legislation modifying the standards for issuanc e of concealed weapons permits because the public act at issue was not an a ct making appropriations to state institutions as contemplated by Const art o The court found that the appropriation of million was directed at funding activities specifically associated with the issuance o f concealed weapon permits rather than sustaining the existence of the Department of State Police Absent any indication that the million appropriation or the fees paid by virtue of another statute were aimed at sustaining the core functions of the Department of State Police the court concluded that the act at issue was not one making appropriations to a sta te institution and was therefore subject to referendum Full Text Opinion Criminal Law

directed verdict on seconddegree murder charge Jury instructions Sentencing Court Michigan Court of Appeals Published Case Name People v Aldrich eJournal Number Judges Kelly and Collins Concurrence Whitbeck Defendants blood alcohol test results were admissible although the y were not under arrest at the time their blood alcohol levels were tested because the applicable statute does not mention

testimony presented at trial indicated that the medical procedures performed on defendants including the withdrawal of their blood were done for medical reasons Although one of the defendants claimed that he was not involved in the accident because his vehicle did not come in contact with another vehicle the defendant was involved in t he accident because his vehicle played a part in the accident

entitled to preclusive effect Whether the bankruptcy courts findings were sufficient to support the conclusion that the debt was nondischargeable Court Bankruptcy Appellate Panel Sixth Circuit Case Name In re Thompson eJournal Number Judges Howard Brown and MorgensternClarren The bankruptcy court erred in giving preclusive effect to the state court magistrates decision in the dischargeability proceeding because there was no final appealable state court judgment entered in the record which wa s entitled to preclusive effect and which could serve as a basis for the bankruptcy courts decision as to the amount and nature of the debt The bankruptcy courts findings of fact were insufficient to support the conclusion that the debt was nondischargeable pursuant to o a because the debtors conversion amounted to embezzlement The bankruptcy courts only independent finding from its trial of the matter did not address all the elements necessary to establish nondischargeability for embezzlement Reversed and remanded Full Text Opinion Constitutional Law Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Municipal Issues Special use permit allowing property owner to operate a busi

on the date set for his trial The presiding judge took testimony from the examining psychologist and defense counsel was allowed the opportunity to crossexamine the witness The psychologist who had interviewed defendant opined that defendant was able to articulate what was occurring in the court proceedings and assist his attorney with his defense Since defense counsel did not move in writi ng

within its authority regarding inter LATA and intraLARA calls Application of the PIC C rates to pay phone calls Attorney fees Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Ameritech Michigan v Michigan Pub Serv Commn eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Smolenski Holbrook Jr and Gage The court affirmed the PSCs order modifying the implementation o f PICCs on intrastate calls because the PICCs were excessive and discriminatory Plaintiff imposed PICC rates on intrastatecalls that nearly corresponded t o the rates allowed by the FCC for interstate calls DefendantATT Communications sought a reduction of the PICC rates from plaintiff Althou gh there was sufficient evidence to determine that the rates were excessive the PSC lacked the necessary information to determine the proper rates Affirmed in part reversed in part Full Text Opinion Criminal Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Drug profile testimony Standard to be applied to error Court Michigan Supreme Court Case Name People v Huston eJournal Number Judges Corrigan Cavanagh Weaver Kelly Taylor Young Jr an d Markman The court vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals see eJourna l in the edition and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration of whether the error in admitting drug profile testimo ny required reversal of defendants conviction The Court of Appeals was instructed that if as plaintiff contended the claimed error was forfeite d the Court of Appeals was to review the issue using the plain error standar d but if the issue was adequately preserved to review for harmless error Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Proportionality of sentence Voluntariness of confession Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Cipponeri eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to a term of to years in prison after his conviction of CSC I Defendant molested his stepdaughter over several years beginning when she was about five years old Defendant admitted to numerous sexual acts with her as we ll as with other children for which he was not charged Defendants longter m sexual abuse of children indicated a low potential for rehabilitation Defendant also coerced the victims submission by preying on her concern f or her dog humiliated her during the act and threatened her should she ever tell what he had done In light of the repulsive nature of defendants alleged conduct that he robbed his stepdaughter of her childhood and tha t he presented a clear threat to other children the court concluded the sentence was not disproportionate Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Proportionality of sentence Trial courts articulation of its reasons for departing from the sentencing guidelines for the seconddegree murder conviction Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Johnson eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Bandstra Gage and Wilder Defendants to years sentence for his assault with intent t o commit murder conviction was proportionate to the seriousness and the offense Defendant argued that the trial court was under the mistaken belief that t he applicable guidelines for the minimum sentence range was to years rather than to years did not articulate sufficient reasons for deviating from the guidelines because the concerns cited by the trial cour t were adequately addressed by the guidelines and disregarded his rehabilitative progress and potential in imposing sentence However the trial court articulated sufficient reasons for a significant departure fro m the guidelines which was proportionate to defendants crime Affirmed Full Text Opinion Family Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Divorce Circuits authority to modify custody or visita tion decisions reached through binding mediation Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Graham v Graham eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The circuit court erroneously substituted its judgment for that of t he binding mediator regarding parenting time because a circuit court may onl y modify custody or visitation decisions reached through binding mediation upon proper cause shown or due to a change of circumstances The circuit court lacked authority to alter the mediators decision simply because it would have resolved the dispute differently Plaintiff did not argue that the mediators decision refusing to restrict the father from having fe male overnight guests while having parenting time with the parties minor ch ild was fraudulent outside his authority or influenced by partiality corruption or misconduct The circuit court did not find that a change of circumstances had occurred and did not provide any justification for its change in the mediators award Reversed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights Jurisdiction over children w here amended petition was served after jurisdictional trial Admissibility of hearsay Whether MCL Abm constitutes an impermissible ex post facto law Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Justin F eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Holbrook Jr Hood and Griffin The trial court did not lack jurisdiction because the amended petiti on allegedly contained new and different jurisdictional allegations and was not served on respondentmother until after the jurisdictional trial Comparison of the original and amended petitions revealed that the respondent was incorrect in her assertion that the amended petition contained approximately eight new additional and different jurisdiction al allegations The amended petition was merely a restructured version of the original petition To the extent that it did contain additional and different allegations any defect in service of the amended petition did n ot warrant reversal because the trial court indicated it was exercising jurisdiction over the children only on the basis of the allegations in the amended petition that matched the first nine allegations in the original petition Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Divorce Property division Inability to prove value of an asset a party seeks to have considered as separate property Valuation of marital home Valuation of a partys inheritance Exclusion of evidence of mari tal infidelity Trial courts failure to consider videotape never expressly offered into evidence Denial of motion for reconsideration Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Robinson v Robinson eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Bandstra Zahra and Meter The trial court did not err in failing to award plaintiff as separat e property the he claimed to have brought into the marriage because he failed to satisfy his burden of proving a reasonably ascertainable amount that he brought into the marriage The amount of money plaintiff brought into the marriage was disputed with plaintiffs claim supported only by his testimony and documents he had drafted Defendant characterized plaintiffs figure as highly inflated and the trial court foun d that while plaintiff probably brought more money into the marriage than defendant the figure was difficult to trace The trial court also did not err in valuing the marital home based on plaintiffs testimony rather than relying on formal appraisals Nothing requires a trial court t o accept the opinion of an expert over that of a layperson The division of the marital estate was affirmed Full Text Opinion Insurance Back to Quicklinks Issues Denial of coverage under policys uninsured motorist provisi on where there was no physical contact between the insured vehicle and anothe r vehicle Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name MacIntosh v Auto Club Ins Assn eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly Since reasonable minds could not differ in concluding that there was no contact between plaintiffs vehicle and the vehicle she swerved to avoid causing her to strike a curb the trial court properly granted summary disposition to defendantinsurer Generally where there is no physical contact between the insureds vehicle and the other vehicle uninsured motorist benefits are not available There was no physical nexus between the other car and the curb While the other car caused plaintiff to swerve and hit the curb that alone was not sufficient absent physical contact between the vehicles While plaintiff contended there was a question of fa ct whether the other vehicle struck her vehicle she failed to present any documentary evidence to support her contention Affirmed Full Text Opinion Litigation Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Negligence Intentional Tort Issues Dismissal of claim on basis plaintiff failed to respond to defendants motion for summary disposition regarding that claim Improp erly pleaded claim for tortious interference with contractual relations Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Auto Dealers Servs Inc v Walker Automotive Resources eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs conspiracy claim on the basis that plaintiff failed to respond to defendants motion for summar y disposition regarding that claim because plaintiff did respond to the motion and submitted evidence showing the existence of a genuine issue of fact Defendant asserted that it could not conspire to breach a contract o f which it had no knowledge Plaintiff responded that defendant did have knowledge and submitted an affidavit to that effect In addition while plaintiff failed to allege in its complaint that defendants instigatio n of the breach was unjustified or to allege facts from which such a conclusion could be drawn it could not be said that plaintiff would be unable to pro ve a tortious interference claim that was properly pleaded On

counsel Dismissal for lack of progress Dismissal as a sanction for plaintiffs failure to provide discovery Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Masuch v GMRI Inc eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Smolenski and Kelly The trial court erred to the extent it dismissed plaintiffs case with prejudice because plaintiff failed to comply with its order regarding substitute counsel Once plaintiffs counsel withdrew plaintiff was wi thout counsel and had the right to represent herself Therefore the court could not compel her to proceed only with counsel without a finding that she was a minor incompetent or otherwise incapable of representing herself Dismissal for lack of progress would also have been improper because the trial court did not provide the required notice
