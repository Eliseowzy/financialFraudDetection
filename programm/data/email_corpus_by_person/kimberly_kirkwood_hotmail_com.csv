Original Message From Reema Bains mailto Sent Monday February PM To Marty Moiseff Renee Christensen Seema Sanghera Tami Doig Betty Arias Lori Walker Nancy Camozzi Stephanie Salkow Subject FW The Rose For you my friend Fax Subject FW The Rose For you my friend Subject Fw The rose The Rose Red roses were her favorites her name was also Rose And every year her husband sent them tied with pretty bows The year he died the roses were delivered to her door the card said Be my Valentine like all the years before Each year he sent her roses and the note would always say I love you even more this year than last year on this day My love for you will always grow with every passing year She knew this was the last time that the roses would appear She thought he ordered roses in advance before this day Her loving husband did not know that he would pass away He always liked to do things early way before the time Then if he got too busy everything would work out fine She trimmed the stems and placed them in a very special vase Then sat the vase beside the portrait of his smiling face She would sit for hours in her husbands favorite chair While staring at his picture and the roses sitting there A year went by and it was hard to live without her mate With loneliness and solitude that had become her fate Then the very hour as on Valentines before The doorbell rang and there were roses sitting by her door She brought the roses in and then just looked at them in shock Then went to get the telephone to call the florist shop The owner answered and she asked him if he would explain Why would someone do this to her causing her such pain I know your husband passed away more than a year ago The owner said I knew youd call and you would want to know The flowers you received today were paid for in advance Your husband always planned ahead He left nothing to chance There is a standing order that I have on file down here And he has paid well in advance youll get them every year There also is another thing that I think you should know He wrote a special little card He did this years ago Then should ever I find out that hes no longer here thats the card that should be sent to you the following year She thanked him and hung up the phone her tears now flowing hard Her fingers shaking as she slowly reached to get the card Inside the card she saw that he had written her a note Then as she stared in total silence she read what he wrote Hello my love I know its been a year since Ive been gone I hope it hasnt been too hard for you to overcome I know it must be lonely and the pain is very real Or if it was the other way I know how I would feel The love we shared made everything so beautiful in life I loved you more than words can say you were the perfect wife You were my friend and lover you fulfilled my every need I know its only been a year but please try not to grieve I want you to be happy even when you shed your tears That is why the roses will be sent to you for years When you get these roses think of all the happiness that we had together and how both of us were blessed I have always loved you and I know I always will But my love you must go on you have some living still Pleasetry to find happiness while living out your days I know it is not easy but I hope you find some ways The roses will come every year and they will only stop when your doors not answered when the florist stops to knock He will come five times that day in case you have gone out But after his last visit he will know without a doubt to take the roses to the place where Ive instructed him and place the roses where we are together once again Sometimes in life you find a special friend Someone who changes your life just by being part of it Someone who makes you laugh until you cant stop Someone who makes you believe that there really is good in the world Someone who convinces you that there really is an unlocked door just waiting for you to open it This is Forever Friendship This is the sacred RED ROSE You MUST pass this rose on to at least people within the hour of receiving this rose After you do make a wish If you youve passed it on your wish will come true and love will come your way shortly If not your life will stay the same as it has always been No Threats Just be nice pass it on May we all be loved so much Friend If I dont get this back I can take a hint How many people actually have true friends Hardly anyone I know But some of us have all right friends and good friends You have been Tagged by the YELLOW bird Which means you are a great friend You will Have Good Luck For Two Years if you send this to people or more and if this is sent back to you then you know that you are a true friend You must send it in minutes or your good luck will be

One day when I was a freshman in high school I saw a kid from my class was walking home from school His name was Kyle It looked like he was carrying all of his books I thought to myself Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday He must really be a nerd I had quite a weekend planned parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon so I shrugged my shoulders and went on As I was walking I saw a bunch of kids running toward him They ran at him knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt His glasses went flying and I Saw them land in the grass about ten feet from him He looked up and I saw this terrible sadness in his eyes My heart went out to him So I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses and I saw a tear in his eye As I handed him his glasses I said Those guys are jerks They really should get lives He looked at me and said Hey thanks There was a big smile on his face It was one of those smiles that showed reaL gratitude I helped him pick up his books and asked him where he lived As it turned out he lived near me so I asked him why I had never seen him before He said he had gone to private school before now I would have never hung out with a private school kid before We talked all the way home and I carried some of his books He turned out to be a pretty cool kid I asked him if he wanted to play a little football with my friends He said yes We hung all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle the more I liked him and my friends thought the same of him Monday morning came and there was Kyle with the huge stack of books again I stopped him and said Boy you are gonna really build some muscles with this pile of books everyday He just laughed and handed me half the books Over the next four years Kyle and I became best friends When we were seniors we began to think about college Kyle decided on Georgetown and I was going to Duke I knew that we would always be friends that the miles would never be a problem He was going to be a doctor and I was going for business on a football scholarship Kyle was valedictorian of our class I teased him all the time about being a nerd He had to prepare a speech for graduation I was so glad it wasnt me having to get up there and speak Graduation day I saw Kyle He looked great He was one of those guys that really found himself during high school He filled out and actually looked good in glasses He had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him Boy sometimes I was jealous Today was one of those days I could see that he was nervous about his speech So I smacked him on the back and said Hey big guy youll be great He looked at me with one of those looks the really grateful one and smiled Thanks he said As he started his

For you my friend Fax Subject FW The Rose For you my friend Subject Fw The rose The Rose Red roses were her favorites her name was also Rose And every year her husband sent them tied with pretty bows The year he died the roses were delivered to her door the card said Be my Valentine like all the years before Each year he sent her roses and the note would always say I love you even more this year than last year on this day My love for you will always grow with every passing year She knew this was the last time that the roses would appear She thought he ordered roses in advance before this day Her loving husband did not know that he would pass away He always liked to do things early way before the time Then if he got too busy everything would work out fine She trimmed the stems and placed them in a very special vase Then sat the vase beside the portrait of his smiling face She would sit for hours in her husbands favorite chair While staring at his picture and the roses sitting there A year went by and it was hard to live without her mate With loneliness and solitude that had become her fate Then the very hour as on Valentines before The doorbell rang and there were roses sitting by her door She brought the roses in and then just looked at them in shock Then went to get the telephone to call the florist shop The owner answered and she asked him if he would explain Why would someone do this to her causing her such pain I know your husband passed away more than a year ago The owner said I knew youd call and you would want to know The flowers you received today were paid for in advance Your husband always planned ahead He left nothing to chance There is a standing order that I have on file down here And he has paid well in advance youll get them every year There also is another thing that I think you should know He wrote a special little card He did this years ago Then should ever I find out that hes no longer here thats the card that should be sent to you the following year She thanked him and hung up the phone her tears now flowing hard Her fingers shaking as she slowly reached to get the card Inside the card she saw that he had written her a note Then as she stared in total silence she read what he wrote Hello my love I know its been a year since Ive been gone I hope it hasnt been too hard for you to overcome I know it must be lonely and the pain is very real Or if it was the other way I know how I would feel The love we shared made everything so beautiful in life I loved you more than words can say you were the perfect wife You were my friend and lover you fulfilled my every need I know its only been a year but please try not to grieve I want you to be happy even when you shed your tears That is why the roses will be sent to you for years When you get these roses think of all the happiness that we had together and how both of us were blessed I have always loved you and I know I always will But my love you must go on you have some living still Pleasetry to find happiness while living out your days I know it is not easy but I hope you find some ways The roses will come every year and they will only stop when your doors not answered when the florist stops to knock He will come five times that day in case you have gone out But after his last visit he will know without a doubt to take the roses to the place where Ive instructed him and place the roses where we are together once again Sometimes in life you find a special friend Someone who changes your life just by being part of it Someone who makes you laugh until you cant stop Someone who makes you believe that there really is good in the world Someone who convinces you that there really is an unlocked door just waiting for you to open it This is Forever Friendship This is the sacred RED ROSE You MUST pass this rose on to at least people within the hour of receiving this rose After you do make a wish If you youve passed it on your wish will come true and love will come your way shortly If not your life will stay the same as it has always been No Threats Just be nice pass it on May we all be loved so much Friend If I dont get this back I can take a

One day when I was a freshman in high school I saw a kid from my class was walking home from school His name was Kyle It looked like he was carrying all of his books I thought to myself Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday He must really be a nerd I had quite a weekend planned parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon so I shrugged my shoulders and went on As I was walking I saw a bunch of kids running toward him They ran at him knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt His glasses went flying and I Saw them land in the grass about ten feet from him He looked up and I saw this terrible sadness in his eyes My heart went out to him So I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses and I saw a tear in his eye As I handed him his glasses I said Those guys are jerks They really should get lives He looked at me and said Hey thanks There was a big smile on his face It was one of those smiles that showed reaL gratitude I helped him pick up his books and asked him where he lived As it turned out he lived near me so I asked him why I had never seen him before He said he had gone to private school before now I would have never hung out with a private school kid before We talked all the way home and I carried some of his books He turned out to be a pretty cool kid I asked him if he wanted to play a little football with my friends He said yes We hung all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle the more I liked him and my friends thought the same of him Monday morning came and there was Kyle with the huge stack of books again I stopped him and said Boy you are gonna really build some muscles with this pile of books everyday He just laughed and handed me half the books Over the next four years Kyle and I became best friends When we were seniors we began to think about college Kyle decided on Georgetown and I was going to Duke I knew that we would always be friends that the miles would never be a problem He was going to be a doctor and I was going for business on a football scholarship Kyle was valedictorian of our class I teased him all the time about being a nerd He had to prepare a speech for graduation I was so glad it wasnt me having to get up there and speak Graduation day I saw Kyle He looked great He was one of those guys that really found himself during high school He filled out and actually looked good in glasses He had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him Boy sometimes I was jealous Today was one of those days I could see that he was nervous about his speech So I smacked him on the back and said Hey big guy youll be great He looked at me with one of those looks the really grateful one and smiled Thanks he said As he started his speech he cleared his throat and began Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years Your parents your teachers your siblings maybe a coachbut mostly your friends I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give them I am going to tell you a story I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met He had planned to kill himself over the weekend He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldnt have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile Thankfully I was saved My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome popular boy told us all about his weakest moment I saw his mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile Not until that moment did I realize its depth Never underestimate the power of your actions With one small gesture you can change a persons life For better or for worse God puts us all in each others lives to impact one another in some way Look for God in others You now have two choices you can Pass this on to your friends or Delete it and act like it didnt touch your heart As you can see I took choice number Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly Its National Friendship Week Show your friends how much you care Eleanor Roosevelt wrote Many people will walk in and out of your life But only true friends will leave footprints in your heart To handle yourself use your head To handle others use your heart Anger is only one letter short of danger If someone betrays you once it is his fault If he betrays you twice it is your fault Great minds discuss ideas Average minds discuss events Small minds discuss people He who loses money loses much He who loses a friend loses much more He who loses faith loses all Beautiful young people are accidents of nature But beautiful old people are works of art Learn from the mistakes of others You cant live long enough to make them all yourself Friends you and meYou brought another friend And
