onsite power or heat flexibly and can be used instantly or compressed cooled and stored for consumption at a later date Go to wwwmalahatenergycomsProductasp and wwwmalahatenergycomsTechnologyasp for more product details Power Market It is estimated that the US will increase its biomass power generation from current levels of GW annually to over GW annually by the year The driving forces behind this dramatic growth profile are the rising cost of power generation and transmission the demand for low environmental impact power sources and the economic benefits to small to medium size businesses of onsite power generation President Bush speaking to Sacramento business leaders on said Our country needs greater energy independence Malahat offers a means to achieving that goal Sales and Marketing During the first phase of the Companys sales and marketing program Malahat has targeted North Americas greenhouse industry which currently has in excess of operations across the continent With the potential to save even small greenhouse operators as much as in annual power costs the initial interest in Malahats proprietary technology has been overwhelming Malahat has already received commitments from North American greenhouse growers for units Management and Growth Malahat has assembled a management team consisting of key individuals with qualifications and experience in power

proprietary patent pending BioFuelTM System enables it to deliver low cost power to high energy consumption industries The BioFuelTM System converts biomass waste to produce a green renewable fuel replacement for natural gas yielding thermal and electrical energy at a fraction of the prevailing market price Malahats proprietary low cost distributed system with on site energy production offers clean power generation It is a cost effective energy solution to the agricultural horticultural and timber industries and to municipalities with abundant biodegradable waste resources for recycling Malahats initial foray into the greenhouse industry with its onsite power supply brings the benefit of substantially reduced energy costs with the added advantage of carbon dioxide enrichment to meet the increasing demands for an alternate energy resource in the climate of escalating energy prices Malahat is a development stage company that has completed its research and development with respect to its M biofuel system and is launching its commercial units for the M biofuel systems in the greenhouse industry The Company was formed in May via a reverse acquisition with Sarenghetti Enterprises Earlier in May Sarenghetti had acquired all the assets liabilities and properties of Malahat Systems Corporation a producer of thermal and electrical energy using biomass waste as fuel Alternative energy is definitely a sector still in its infancy But investors need to realize that the demand for the Companys products are real and necessary Net profit projections show an impressive growth rate of between FY and FY to between FY and FY to between FY and FY to and between FY and FY to The associated Earnings Per Share will grow from to in year to in year to in year and to in year Utilizing a

Energy sector If we use this sectors Price to Earnings ratio of to Malahat is targeted for even more impressive share price forecasts for FY return for FY return for FY return for FY return Note To meet the suggested target prices the Company would have to trade at least at the Oil Gas Operation Industry multiples and the Company would have to achieve earnings and revenue estimates provided by management in this report A divergence either up or down from the projections could materially affect the target prices Comparison of Alternate Energy Companies wwwinvestorstoolkitcommahtmahtcomphtm Within the alternate energy sector on the Comparisons of Alternate Energy Companies wwwinvestorstoolkitcommahtmahtcomphtm there are nine companies with annual sales between million and million The average price to sales ratio of these companies is over Estimated annual revenue for Malahat based upon existing lease commitments of units is The present market capitalization of Malahat at per share is Based on the anticipated commitments of units the pricesales ratio for Malahat Energy Corporation is which represents a vastly substantial discount from its peer group It would appear likely that as Malahat progresses with the execution of its business plan and the delivery of its first commercial units of M BioFuelTM systems to customers early investors will be heavily rewarded by this large discount to market as the price sales ratio elevates to meet that of its peer group On an assumption of a future share price of say per share the forecasted pricesales ratio will then be at which shall remain conservatively lower than the average pricesales ratio in excess of in the alternate energy sector defined at wwwinvestorstoolkitcommahtmahtcomphtm Additionally the anticipated sales

mailing list please find instructions at bottom of page Powerball International Inc Symbol PRBL Recommended Price at Target for FY Week Range Financial Summary Powerball International Inc the Company was formed in July for the purpose of raising capital to invest in a joint venture to develop certain technology relating to the production of hydrogen to generate hydrogen for sale and to market hydrogen generating equipment and products During the Company acquired the remaining interest in the joint venture Powerball Technologies LLC Tech which is now operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company The Company through Tech is involved in research and development efforts of commercializing the technology Powerball expects that initial revenues will be generated primarily by the construction of a commercial sodium plant in Green River Wyoming Additional revenues may be derived from the licensing of the Technology andor manufacturing and sale of hydrogen generation systems Powerball had no revenues for the three and six months ended June and respectively and has had no revenues since July For the three and nine months ended September Powerball had total operating expenses of and respectively compared to and For the three and nine month period ended September The increase in operating expenses is attributable primarily to a substantial increase in research and development costs of and respectively offset by small decreases in general and administrative expenses and respectively and professional fees and respectively The increase in research and development costs reflects the Companys acquisition of ownership of Powerball Technologies LLC Tech in the second quarter of fiscal and consequent responsibility for all the research costs associated with Tech As a result of the merger Tech is the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and all the expenses of Tech are consolidated with those expenses of the Company The Company expects that it will continue to incur operational losses for the next twelve months primarily as a result of expenditures related to the operation of the Pilot Sodium Plant in West Valley City Utah and the general overhead thereto The Company believes that the Pilot Plant will demonstrate successful completion of the milestones set for it before the end of Once continuous operation and product quality have been verified in the Pilot Plant and Industrial Revenue Development Bond funding obtained construction may begin on the commercial sodium facility in Wyoming that will produce initial revenues ShareRelated Items Recent Price Market Capitalization M Shares Outstanding M Float M Daily Volume day avg K Delayed Quote qsprblobdv Business Description Powerball Technologies is focused on innovative hydrogen distribution technologies At the heart of its technology is the proprietary hydride pellets or PowerballsTM which dramatically increase the storage density and distribution efficiency for hydrogen through incremental and ondemand production of hydrogen for a wide range of applications from industrial hydrogen to portable fuel cell systems A revolutionary technology for the production of sodium metal from sodium hydroxide using natural gas energy is being demonstrated in a pilot plant facility Sodium metal as produced by this recycling plant will be used in the manufacture of sodium hydride which can be pelletized and individually encapsulated with polyethylene plastic for the highly dense yet safe storage and distribution of hydrogen Hydrogen gas is produced incrementally and upon demand through the use of a patented portable hydrogen generator system The plastic coated pellets are sliced open one at a time within the generator to provide hydrogen as needed A gallon of sodium hydride is capable of producing gallons of hydrogen gas which is an equivalent hydrogen storage density more than times greater by volume than a compressed hydrogen tank storing hydrogen at psi Since the powerball fuel pellets can be delivered and utilized at near room temperature and pressure the usual problems and costs for highly pressurized hydrogen or cryogenically stored hydrogen can be safely eliminated Additionally the pellets are considerably more energy dense and can provide hydrogen for an end user at a cost less than through the more traditional means of delivering hydrogen An exciting future potential use for powerball fuel pellets is for the supply of hydrogen to fuel cell vehicles To supply hydrogen fuel as powerball plastic coated hydride pellets is unique More conventional methods for supplying a fuel to a vehicle usually require that a hydrocarbon is pumped from the ground refined and then burned onboard the vehicle to provide energy There are a number of problems with a business as usual approach to fuel supplies for vehicles More than of all transportation fuel for vehicles is currently imported from other countries which makes the USA potentially vulnerable to and dependant upon other foreign countries As hydrocarbons are burned onboard vehicles either by reformers or by combustion engines the CO emissions are exhausted into the atmosphere More than million metric tons of carbon as CO waste is exhausted into our air each year The incredibly large amounts of CO waste are beginning to have costly environmental impacts on our planet As hydrocarbon fuels are transferred from refineries into trucks from trucks into tanks at fuel stations and from fuel stations into vehicles a large amount of hydrocarbon emissions are produced which contribute to unhealthy air with negative impacts on health to millions of people living in cities around the world Hydrocarbon fuels are produced by the earth at a rate more than times slower than we are consuming them which means that hydrocarbons are a nonrenewable resource Powerball fuel pellets can be produced using a variety of energy sources Powerballs current recycling plant is powered by natural gas When natural gas is used to produce powerballs CO is produced Conveniently CO from a central plant can be stored unlike CO produced onboard a vehicle which cannot be stored and must be exhausted into the atmosphere Even more exciting is that solar energy wind energy hydroelectric energy or even fusion power if developed could be used to produce powerballs Since powerballs are merely an energy storage medium and not an energy source whatever energy source is available can be used to produce the coated fuel pellets Powerball technology if used on a large scale nationally would enable the USA to produce its own fuel for vehicles without having to rely on other nations for oil We have large supplies of natural gas in the USA which can be used to produce NaH powerballs from waste NaOH Additionally as powerballs are shipped stored or transferred from tank to tank there would be zero harmful hydrocarbon emissions Polyethylene coated pellets cannot evaporate and neither NaOH solution or water produces harmful emissions The cost for producing powerballs from waste NaOH and recycled polyethylene ball shells is greatly reduced by producing very large volumes of pellets Powerball is focused on the production of hydride pellets in large volumes from waste NaOH As the technology is improved and as the production volumes increase the powerball pellets will represent an inexpensive alternative source of hydrogen for hydrogen customers who currently receive hydrogen in bulky and expensive compressed hydrogen tube trailers Eventually as very large volumes of fuel pellets are produced the pelletized fuel along with ordinary tap water could one day become the infrastructure fuel of choice for fuel cell vehicles Web site wwwpowerballnet For more see Expanded Business Description wwwtheinvestoronlinecomresearchprblbusdeschtm Analyst Summary The Powerball concept allows for cheap easy and safe storage of hydrogen and requires very little in the way of specialized storage There are no special temperature or compression considerations that need to be worried about Princeton University Chemistry Department The concept behind Powerball Technologies is to tame energy so to speak and to store one powerful element sodium or sodium hydride in order to later get Hydrogen on Demand PowerballTM fuel pellets store and produce hydrogen on demand Each gallon of powerball fuel pellets produces hundreds of gallons of hydrogen upon contact with water on an asneeded basis Powerball fuel pellets offer a safe compact and inexpensive alternative to the delivery storage and use of compressed or liquid hydrogen for a wide range of applications which require a clean source of hydrogen Powerball fuel pellets are not an energy source The Company will never drill a hole in the ground and discover a large reserve of hydrogen or hydride pellets Instead fuel pellets can be used as an efficient energy carrier The hydride pellets can be produced using energy from diverse energy sources all over the world such as biomass natural gas wind energy hydroelectric power and solar energy Because they are safe and energy dense they can be distributed to buses boats houses and hydrogen users by rail sea or highway Powerball fuel pellets offer new options for the distribution of energy that do not rely on oil pipelines or electricity transmission lines Even a disruption in a natural gas pipeline for instance would not preclude the distribution of powerball fuel pellets via trucks trains or ships to where energy is needed Additionally when powerballs are used to provide hydrogen to vehicles or stationary applications there are no pointofuse hydrocarbon emissions or CO emissions When powerballs are transferred from one tank into another tank there are also zero emissions Therefore powerball fuel pellets are a responsible and environmentally friendly energy carrier Powerball is currently in the research and development stage in preparation for commercializing the technology Revenue and profit projections show sales commencing in FY The projections show steady growth from M in FY to M in FY to in FY Net profits forecasts are equally impressive M in FY M in FY M in FY The associated Earnings Per Share project to for FY for FY and for FY We place Powerball in the Energy sector Utilizing the associated to Price to Earnings ratio for

to get your FREE copy Its a LOWRISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money by this time next yearthen make your fortune several times over in the years to come But sadly most investors will MISS OUTbecause they believe the myth about the socalled glut of fiber optic cable Heres the REAL story WHEN the World Trade Center got hit the Internet slowed downvery noticeably slowed down In fact it nearly came to a grinding halt That means there isnt nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to accommodate a blip in demand Sources tell me that the government is very worried about this problem After all this is the second time its happened Back in July a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full days That means our communications systemsand therefore our economyare very very vulnerable Ten years ago it wouldnt have mattered But today commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those systems Virtually nothing moves without it Thats how banks and brokerages transfer fundshow dispatchers route fleets of truckshow many Americans get paid through direct deposit And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than of Americans even begin to understand Heres one example Qwestone of Americas biggest carriersrecently said theyre loaded on their network That doesnt sound too baduntil you understand how these networks operate You cant load a network much past In fact is virtually CATASTROPHIC because the network spends so much time searching for open channels it doesnt spend any time actually sending packets of information The system locks Communications stops The nation comes to a standstill AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed world Internet traffic systems currently run faster in Australia Europe and even South America Thats because we push out more data than everyone elsebut were not increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate Weve got to catch upand weve got to catch up fast Otherwise business the economy and our national security all go in the CRAPPER BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a fiber glut Because of all the fiber that has ever been laid is darkthat is its not activated And the company Im recommending is the supplier of the components needed to do the job Im looking at a DOUBLEpossibly a TRIPLE by this time next year And I fully expect to multiply our money fivetimes over by In fact this stock truly has tenbagger potential At the height of the boom this companys stock was some times higher So what changed Spending on communications networks dried up Now the government is ready to pump billion in emergency spending into the economy interest rates are practically zero and the need isnt just vital for the economy anymoreits a question of NATIONAL SECURITY

International Target Market The tremendous growth of the Internet has revolutionized the communications industry Today the Internet connects millions of people around the world who are able to share information instantly without geographic boundaries The Internet is bound only by the voice network upon which it resides without this network in place users cannot take advantage of powerful Internet applications In developed countries such as the United States the requisite voice network is already in place hence the number of Internet users is growing at unprecedented rates In developing countries such as Nigeria China India and Brazil there is little or no basic voice network leaving many of these nations struggling to take part in the Internet revolution The demand for Internet applications such as distance learning municipal virtual private networks and medicalemergency communications systems have induced developing countries to aggressively invest in communications infrastructure These countries must first build a basic voice network the platform of the Internet before they can become part of this information revolution The total incremental information infrastructure spending is projected to reach trillion over the next ten years according to Pyramid Research The following table shows projected fiveyear information infrastructure spending for selected countries Projected Information Infrastructure Investment by Country Number Lines Built Cumulative Investment s US millions China India Brazil Nigeria Source Pyramid Research o A Billion Domestic Market According to International Data Corp IDC the worldwide Internet firewall market will grow to billion by IDC also projects that the investment in the US market for network service provision by digital broadband means will grow to billion by What is fueling these explosive growth estimates The answer is simple the vast expansion of electronic commerce ecommerce both businesstobusiness commerce and businesstoconsumer commerce We are all familiar with the household names in ecommerce like Dell Computer and Amazoncom These businesses are large enough and sophisticated enough to handle networking and ecommerce technology largely on their own But what about small to medium size businesses What about branch offices of larger organizations How will they survive and compete in the ecommerce marketplace Much of the forecasted growth in firewall and digital broadband markets will come from the tens of thousands of small to mediumsize enterprises that have historically lacked the human resources to address ecommerce on their own and the financial resources to acquire expensive technological solutions These businesses will require vendorpartners who can help them with affordable simple doityourself Internet solutions One company which stands out as a potential leader in voice and Internet switching industry with the vision and strategy to leverage this tremendous telecommunications growth opportunity is NYbased Cyber Digital OTCBB CYBD Cyber Digital is a wellestablished telecommunications company with Agreements to market promote and sell its products throughout Nigeria a veteran management team a firm grasp of the issues and opportunities of the telecommunications market a successful synergistic alliance with telecommunications giant ATT and a suite of affordable products and services to complement its other strengths Priced at only per share as of the market close on May Cyber Digital Inc is unquestionably undervalued and worth a closer look o A Brief History of Cyber Digital Since its inception in Cyber Digital Inc has designed and manufactured highquality software controlled distributed digital voice switching infrastructure systems for public telephone network operators worldwide especially for developing countries Cyber Digital is also a leading software developer and manufacturer of an array of high performance Internet systems such as routers gateways firewalls and servers for the creation of digital broadband and virtual private network VPN services by Internet service providers ISP The Companys voice and Internet systems incorporate digital wireless transmission which enable developing countries to easily and rapidly deploy telecommunications services to underserved consumers within months rather than years Such long years are typical of competitors monolithic voiceonly centralized switches which require underground cabling infrastructure The Company believes that it is one of a very few if not the only company in the world with proprietary technology of distributed digital switching ideally suited for the developing countries In early the Company made the strategic decision to expand and leverage its many years of telecommunications experience by entering the broadband Internet products market Recognizing the enormous need and opportunity to provide a comprehensive suite of ebusiness products to small and medium size businesses Cyber Digital has developed a full set of Internet Protocol IP security access and storage products in conjunction with its strategic partner ATT o Recent Developments Expects to earn per share for FYE In April Cyber Digital announced that it expects to earn per share for FYE from projected revenues of million generated from the Nigerian market Due to the Companys early mover advantage position in the Nigerian market it anticipates profitability in each of the last three quarters of FYE In addition the Company expects to realize revenues from the digital wireless telephone network projects in five Nigerian states in the aggregate sum of million which have not been incorporated in these projections We feel that our Companys stock is highly undervalued and does not reflect the true value of its technology and growth potential Once the Company has the resources it may buyback its shares in the open market from time to time said JC Chatpar Chairman of Cyber Digital Inc Received approval of its proposals to build digital wireless telephone networks in five states of Nigeria In April Cyber Digital announced that it has received approval of its proposals to build digital wireless telephone networks in five states of Nigeria for an aggregate sum of million Cyber Digitals wireless CDCO exchange was approved based on its ability to rapidly deliver telephone service at affordable network cost requiring no stranded capital said His Royal Highness Austin Ezenwa Chairman of Sydney Telecommunications Each of the five states has appropriated capital for the implementation of Cyber Digitals wireless telephone network In addition to existing contracts this accomplishment signifies our longterm viability by capturing a significant share of this market in early stages said JC Chatpar Chairman of Cyber Digital Inc We expect to engineer furnish and install these systems within the next twelve months Enters the Billion Internet Firewall Appliance Market In January Cyber Digital announced that the Company is entering the Billion Internet firewall appliance market with the introduction of its Cyber Firewall CFW Series firewall appliances Cyber Digital Offers Simple DoItYourself Installation Software on Its Standalone IPSec Firewall Appliance For BB eCommerce Secure Access and Virtual Private Network Applications IPSec is an industrywide standard for assuring the privacy integrity and authenticity of information crossing public IP networks Cyber Digitals CFW series firewalls offer simple doityourself installation software for even the most complex IPSecbased security application CFW IPSec provides a costeffective way of creating an enterprisewide virtual private network VPN by enabling secure use of the Internet CFW IPSec based on Cyber Digitals proprietary technology is a standalone firewall appliance and is totally independent of the customers computing operating system platform It does not need to be integrated into customers environment by specialists often a costly proposition Nontechnical customers can easily install the CFW firewall appliance In addition CFW series firewalls are fully interoperable with Cisco Systems Check Point Software Technologies and Nortel Networks firewalls Cyber Digitals CFW appliance type security offerings will facilitate the secure access and implementation of VPNs for BB ecommerce companies Our unique CFW series firewall appliance will be marketed through major strategic partners or distributors on a worldwide basis The simplicity of implementing CFW in any network will cause a profound impact on the firewall market As an Internet firewall appliance it offers cost savings in excess of over competitors offerings said JC Chatpar Chairman of Cyber Digital Inc According to International Data Corporation IDC the worldwide Internet firewall market increased from billion to billion during to Similar growth is projected for the period to leading to a worldwide market of billion Expands into the PABX market with CSX to government institutions In January Cyber Digital jointly announced with Sidney Telecommunications Nigeria Ltd their expansion into the PABX market Demand for Cyber Digitals CSX PABX by government institutions is overwhelming due to rapid growth of the capital city of Abuja said His Royal Highness Austin Ezenwa Chairman of Sydney Telecommunications On behalf of Cyber Digital Sydney Tel is expecting to receive a blanket order for CSX PABX lines from one of the government institutions for a number of its offices Sydney Tel is confident that Cyber Digitals CSX PABX will become a standard office telephone system among many government institutions as it offers modern communications features We are pleased with Sydney Tels efforts in expanding the market for our CSX PABX product line said JC Chatpar Chairman of Cyber Digital Inc The initial order for CSX lines reflects approximately million in revenues Pursuant to the terms of the order payment terms are cash in advance with the order and by irrevocable letter of credit upon shipment Enters the Nigerian Telecommunications Market In November Cyber Digital Inc signed an agreement with Sidney Telecommunications Nigeria Ltd a private company to market promote and sell Cyber Distributed Digital Central Office Exchanges CDCO Cyber Tandem Switch Exchanges CTSX and Cyber Switch PABX CSX throughout Nigeria Under the terms of the agreement Sydney Telecommunications will also market Cyber Digitals Exchanges to the Nigerian Telecommunications Ltd NITEL the sole government owned provider of public switched telephone network services in Nigeria In order to enter the untapped Nigerian telecommunications market Cyber Digital Inc has already registered Cyber Digital Nigeria Ltd as its subsidiary and established its offices in the capital city of Abuja With about lines in operation for a country with a population of million people the current telephone density is one of the lowest in the world said His Royal Highness Austin Ezenwa chairman of Sydney Telecommunications NITELs goal to increase telephone density through deployment of two million lines by year can only be achieved by Cyber Digitals unique technology that renders rapid deployment coupled with affordability Cyber Digital will carve out a significant share of the Nigerian telecommunications market as its digital switches are ideally suited for developing countries Demand for our CDCO and CTSX exchanges will increase as NITEL places great effort in building its telecommunications infrastructure said JC Chatpar chairman of Cyber Digital Inc We believe Cyber Digital will be an important participant in the rapidly expanding Nigerian telecommunications marketplace With the assistance of Sidney Telecommunications Cyber Digital has bid on a public tender issued by NITEL for the supply and installation of digital lines in the capital city of Abuja Pursuant to the bid requirements manufacturers of digital exchanges were exclusively permitted to make an offer to NITEL All such tenders were publicly opened and results were announced at the corporate headquarters of NITEL Offers varied from low end of million from Cyber Digital to high end of million from Siemens Bids from Cyber Digital Alcatel Ericsson and Siemens were the only bids technically qualified While the other three bidders were major European manufacturers Cyber Digital was the only American manufacturer to qualify Payment terms are cash advance upon contract award and by irrevocable letter of credit upon shipment of digital exchanges Supply and installation of digital exchanges are expected to be completed within nine months Made a strategic shift to enter the fast growing lucrative highspeed Internet access market During FYE the Company made a strategic shift to enter the fast growing lucrative highspeed Internet access market The Company rapidly developed its Cyber Business Internet Gateway CBIG and Cyber Internet Access Network CIAN switch The Company forged an alliance with ATT Corporation to become a provider of highspeed Internet access and to create Virtual Private Networks VPN for businesses using Internet Protocol IP broadband technology At the heart of Cyber Digitals unique set of product offerings is its unique distributive voice and broadband solutions which offer many advantages over the traditional voice and broadband approaches Cyber Digitals Unique Distributive Voice Solution Current Telephone Network Building telecommunications infrastructure using traditional monolithic centralized switching systems from multinational suppliers poses tremendous financial constraints and deployment time limitations because of outside plant underground cabling Cyber Digital Wireless Network The modularity derived from the nodal structure of the CDCO provides an economical digital switching exchange from as low as a few hundred lines to over a million lines capacity In addition it offers fully integrated local tandem toll and transit exchange capabilities The CDCO has interfaces for digital microwave systems digital copper wire systems digital radio relay systems digital wireless systems fiber optic systems and satellite systems The costs associated with this approach is dramatically less than the installation cost associated with laying fiber or copper on the network side material costs rightofway issues and regulatory obstacles Cyber Digitals Unique Distributive Broadband Solution In the traditional broadband solution offered by most digital broadband Internet Services Providers today office buildings are daisychained together with fiber or T wiring This results in several hops to the POP This traditional solution has three inherent disadvantages a point of failure at each building in the chain security vulnerability at each building in the chain and decreased network performance With Cyber Digitals innovative Distributive Broadband solution there is no daisychain Each office building is connected directly by fiber or T lines to the ATT POP ie theres only one hop to the POP In bringing the Internet closer to the user the Cyber Digital solution offers enhanced performance enhanced security and eliminates the disadvantage of multiple points of failure o The Experienced Senior

Market Snapshot The Week in Review Monday Memorial Day markets closed Tuesday Rumors dominated a thin market to start the holiday shorten week The rumors swirled around two companies Lucent Technologies LU and Sun Micro Systems SUNW The rumors surrounding Lucent was whether or not it was going to merge with Alcatel ALA of France At the end of the day Lucent and Alcatel announced a surprise that they were not in imminent agreement actually that they were not in agreement at all and that talks were off Sun Micro started the day with a earnings warning from Goldman Sachs on the sector especially storage opportunities that encompassed not only Suns push into that area but also storage leaders such as EMC EMC After the close Sun confirmed the worst by warning on their revenues and earnings for the present quarter What really shook traders and investors were the managements accusations that not only were things difficult in the US market but also weakening in Europe and Asia Europe has recently been the underpinning of optimism for the Suns sector and their view that it is slowing rocks at the heart of investor hopes for the sector Wednesday There appeared no where to hide safely with the exception of some of the oil sector driven by ExxonMobils announcement of a stock split and an extra dividend on top of its normal quarterly dividend this quarter Two other bright spots were earnings related International House of Pancakes IHOP and Toll Brothers TOL IHOP hit another week high on consistent results and a management stance committed to improve them going forward Toll Brothers is a highend homebuilder that caters to the wellheeled buyer especially empty nesters highend reduced size homes and communities As a rule the balance of the market was a washout no matter what the sector but the tech and telecom sectors led the way lower off the warnings we mentioned from Alcatel ALA and Sun Micro SUNW The recent market falls have wiped out all the gains the market had made since the last rate cut by the Fed earlier in May Usually the warning season does not start until the second half of the last month of the quarter for this quarter that would be the second half of June but warnings are starting already Capital expenditure budgets may have started to stabilize in the US but the have not been showing any signs of growth domestically especially in the tech and telecom areas The large cap companies in those sectors were relying on the strength in Europe and Asia to provide the growth factor now that the US was stabilized That hope appears to be evaporating as the foreign markets are starting to decline We have known for some time that the economy was expected to continue weak until the end of the year The market is expected to look beyond that to the rebound in the future at least that is if the rebound should be felt in the next months Still when faced with the reality of current bad news investors are unwilling to open up their wallets and buy Thursday A rebound on the major indices held through until the close today a day after a selloff had erased market gains posted since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates a little more than two weeks ago The Nasdaq Composite ended the day up by about points or to breaking its threeday losing streak The index of technology stocks fell yesterday The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained about points to about but its still below the benchmark Ahead of tomorrows employment report by all accounts the most important economic event this week government data released this morning showed that initial jobless claims for the week ended May rose to from a revised figure for the previous week of Economists had been expecting new claims for the week By contrast the fourweek average fell to from a revised figure for the previous week of Friday A slightly better than expected employment report for May and a slightly worse than expected NAPM reading were shrugged off by the market to close higher There were other mixed signals for the market to digest Cisco CSCO announced that capital expenditures continued to look weak impacting the telecom equipment sector The big three automakers also surprised to the upside mainly GM GM actually reported an overall sales increase of when they were expected to decline Truck sales were especially strong up and GM is boosting production of some models Daimler Chrysler DCX reported a decline in sales of but the expectation was for a decline of Ford F reported a sales decline led by a drop in Explorer sales But there was a silver lining in that announcement that daily sales of the Explorer rose throughout the month indicating that the drop off may be only temporary and that Explorer sales would not be impacted by the recent woes with BridgestoneFirestone Major Stock Market Indices Trends Index DJIA SP NASDAQ RUT Close on Week Before Change Months Before Change Year Before Change o DJIA Dow Jones Industrial Average

of weeks of the month Finally would like to remind everyone that since June is a Friday therefore triple witching options expiration will occur on June a scant weeks away That means book squaring and

FRAUD part Commodity futures and options are prime targets for fraudulent offerings The past few weeks we have been discussing different types of fraud and ways to protect yourself and your money This week we will look at promises of easy profits from buying precious metals and other commodities Consumers should be alert to companies that sell investments in precious metals and other commodities based on sales pitches claiming customers can make a lot of money with little risk by purchasing metal through a financing agreement Sometimes these companies offer opportunities to speculate on the price movement of precious metals or other commodities such as heating oil without actually taking delivery of the commodity The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC is the federal agency that regulates the trading of commodity futures and options contracts in the United States and takes action against firms suspected of illegally or fraudulently selling commodity futures and options Over the past several years the CFTC has taken enforcement action against wrongdoers who lured customers to purchase purported interests in precious metals without taking delivery through various misrepresentations including claims that they would earn large profits with little risk Certain companies advertise on radio television or Internet web sites or make telephone cold calls to promote the purchase of precious metals such as gold silver and platinum The advertisements infomercials and telephone solicitations often promise quick riches such as the ability to double or triple the customers initial investment in just two or three months all with low risk Companies making such statements typically ask that customers pay only a small percentage of the total purchase price and also claim that they or another company will purchase and store the metal These companies also pretend to arrange financing for the customers metal purchase so the customer can obtain a larger profit by controlling a larger amount of metal with their relatively small down payment Companies often discourage customers from taking delivery of the metal These companies often charge a commission for the purchase transaction a loan origination fee an interest charge on the remaining balance which accrues over time and fees relating to storage and shipping of the metal they pretend to purchase for the customer Sometimes not all of these fees are disclosed up front Whats Wrong With Such Sales Pitches Companies making such pitches often lie about or overstate their ability to predict prices or the direction of the metals markets minimize the degree of investment risk involved in metals investments fraudulently fail to disclose how much the price of metal must go up for the customer to break even let alone profit since hefty finance and storage fees and commissions are deducted from the customers account before any profits accrue falsely claim to be purchasing and storing the metal when they do not actually do so Indeed companies often discourage customers from taking delivery of the metal charge phony storage fees for metal when no metal is actually purchased or stored charge phony interest fees that diminish a customers account equity to the point where the customer has to deposit additional funds with the company or have his account closed out at a total loss The interest fees are phony because no metal has been purchased as promised and the financing arrangement therefore is fictitious fail to point out that because you are buying on margin or with leverage you will have to send the company additional funds or sell a portion of your metal position if the price of the precious metals moves unfavorably Warning Signs Of Commodity ComeOns If you are solicited by a company to purchase commodities watch for the warning signs listed below Avoid any company that predicts or guarantees large profits with little or no financial risk Be wary of highpressure tactics to convince you to send or transfer cash immediately to the firm via overnight delivery companies the internet by mail or otherwise Be skeptical about unsolicited phone calls about investments from offshore salespersons or companies with which you are unfamiliar Prior to purchasing contact the CFTC wwwcftcgov or other authorities including your states securities commissioner wwwnasaaorg Attorney Generals consumer protection bureau wwwnaagorgindexhtml the Better Business Bureau wwwbbbcom and the National Futures Association wwwnfafuturesorg Be sure you get all information about the company and verify that data if possible If you can check the companys materials with someone whose financial advice you trust Learn all possible information about fees and commissions charged and the basis for each of these charges If in doubt dont invest If you cant get solid information about the company the salesperson and the investment you may not want to risk your money Use Extra Care When Dealing with Foreign Companies Sometimes companies that solicit customer investments in precious metals or their purported storage facilities are located outside the United States even if they do not reveal that fact to you while soliciting your investment United States government agencies generally have little or no regulatory authority over entities operating outside the United States If you transfer funds to foreign firms or place funds with United States firms that are later transferred to offshore companies it may be difficult or impossible for you to recover your money Storing metal offshore particularly in countries with secrecy laws might make it difficult for you to verify your investment Ask where all companies that would handle your funds are located where any telephone call you receive originates where your funds will be deposited and kept and where the metal will be stored If possible telephone the company IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER The information contained in the documents in

Website design Website hosting Internetbased yellow pages directory listings and other enhanced telecommunications services eLEC is a competitive local exchange carrier a CLEC and they are building the company using the unbundled network element platform UNEP The UNEP service offering is the most rapid and profitable way to enter a new market The Company believes that it is more important to build a customer base first before building the network Using this method eLEC is able to use their capital resources wisely and avoid the high cost of underutilized facilities Furthermore eLEC believes that a large portion of their UNEP base will eventually migrate to packet telecommunications offerings such as local voice over DSL Therefore the most intelligent way to build their business

Analyst Summary eLECs chart has show quite an improvement lately and is now in the midst of what technicians refer to as a flag formation A flag formation is one in which the stock is consolidating in a rectangular tight range for days following a big move This is considered a bullish consolidation when following an upmove and is usually the half way point in a move If the stock breaks out to the upside look for a probable move from the breakout equal to the distance from the beginning of the move to to the top of the flag which would be See chart to target of Flags reach their target of the time and once a breakout occurs only fail of the time so this stock looks good right now Bullish consolidating flags like this one breakout to the downside of the time The stats are with us on this one Good luck We believe the stock has a a share value on price to sales and a discounted value on price to book We also believe its a speculative value play based on sales growth and assets alone If they reach profitability in they could be valued near Much of eLECs value resides in their approach to the market which allows for rapid market entry via the UNEP service offering with high growth potential a very large addressable market and high margins Additional strength is provided due to no stranded plant costs no costs associated with technological obsolescence and no costly delays that occur when a company has to install equipment in the field The Company will reach breakeven much sooner than most companies and they will do it with flexibility which is very important in a dynamic marketplace eLEC is not captive to their own network like many other companies Other companies have a relatively small addressable market and are forced to overspend on marketing in order to attract customers to their network eLEC has a ubiquitous reach in each state in which they are licensed million lines as an addressable market in states When eLEC receives licensing in all states the addressable market may be approaching million lines Rapid market entry high margins ubiquity no equipment installations no salesmen carrying around network maps the ability to telemarket the entire state ability to service multilocation businesses within the state and with multistate presences eLEC attracts customers first building a customer base instead of putting equipment in the field first like everyone else has The Company is in essence a virtual LEC They are using the existing infrastructure of the incumbents to further their business so they can own their customers They are provisioning DSL in Orlando FL from Norwalk CT without having any equipment in the field The Company is virtual eLEC runs their DSL pipe thru ATM clouds owned by the incumbents eLEC controls the bandwidth and services for the customer by capping both ends of the pipe We know of no one else who is doing this eLEC Communications Corp is creative flexible and talented The spending to build networks has come back to haunt many of those that went with the network first plan Those companies are now scrambling to stay alive eLECs model of building the customer base first appears to be the

The cup or cupwithhandle formation is a chart pattern that identifies stocks preparing for a breakout to new highs or the start of a new uptrend This pattern in history has shown to be the most popular in preceding a big move up in a stocks price This was popularized by William ONeil Founder of Investors Business Daily Newspaper and his CANSLIM method of stock picking outlined in his book How to Make Money in Stocks The CANSLIM approach to investing combines technical and fundamental analysis to identify promising stocks in leading industries According to the system only those stocks meeting a set of quantifiable criteria are candidates for purchase In addition a stock must exhibit one of three or four different chart patterns that summarize less quantifiable aspects of the system The CANSLIM characteristics are often present prior to a stock making a significant rise in price and making huge profits for the shareholders ONeil explains how he conducted an intensive study of of the biggest winners in the stock market from to A model of each of these companies was built and studied Again and again it was noticed that almost all of the biggest stock market winners had very similar characteristics just before they began their big moves This week will look at the last four components of CANSLIM S L I and M S SupplyDemand Small Cap Volume Supply and demand dictates the price of almost everything in your life The law of supply and demand is more important than all the analyst opinions on Wall Street The price of a stock with million shares is hard to budge up because of the large supply of stock available Yet if a company has only or million shares outstanding a reasonable amount of buying can push the price up rapidly because of the small available supply If you are choosing between two stocks to buy one with million shares outstanding and one with million shares with all other factors equal the smaller one will usually be the bigger mover Stocks that have a large percentage owned by top management are generally better prospects Again referencing ONeils year study more than of the companies had less than million shares outstanding when they had their greatest period of earnings improvement and stock price performance Foolish stock splits can hurt a stocks performance Watch out for companies that split their stock or times in just a year or two The splitting creates a larger supply and may make a companys stock performance more lethargic like many big cap companies Large holders who thinking of selling are often inclined to sell their share positions before a for split would have them looking to sell Smart short sellers an infinitesimal group pick on stocks beginning to falter after enormous price runups and splits realizing that the potential number of shares for sale particularly by funds has dramatically been increased L Leader or Laggard Which is your stock People often buy stocks theyre comfortable and familiar with like an old pair of shoes Usually these are lagging slowpokes rather than leaping leaders It is really important to look at how your stock is performing in relation to the overall market The best performing stocks from to averaged a relative price strength of scale of just before they began their major advances in price Avoid laggard stocks and look for genuine leaders I Institutional Sponsorship Institutional Sponsorship It takes big demand to move a stock significantly higher in price Institutional buyers are the most powerful source You dont need a large number of institutional owners but should have at least a few No institutional sponsorship in a stock is a bad sign because odds are that many institutional investors looked at the stock and passed it over The things we are looking for with CANSLIM are really signs that the bigger money mutual funds banks insurance companies pension funds etc is coming into the stock See that there is a betterthanaverage performance record by at least a few of the institutional owners Another good thing about some institutional sponsorship is that it provides buying support for the stock Beware of stocks that become over owned By the time performance is so obvious that almost all institutions own it it is probably too late Pay attention to whether the number of institutional owners is increasing or decreasing M Market Direction Market Direction You can be right on everything else but if you are wrong about the direction of the broad market you are still likely to lose money The best way to analyze the overall market is to follow and understand every day what the general averages are doing They are difficult to recognize but meaningful changes in the behavior of the market averages at important turning points is the best indicator of the condition of the whole market What signs should you look for to detect a market top On one of the days in the uptrend the total volume for the market will increase over the preceding days high volume but the Dows closing average will show stalling action or substantially less upward movement than on prior days The spread between the daily high and low of the market index will likely be a bit larger than on the earlier days Normal market liquidation near the market peak will only occur on one or two days which are part of the uptrend The market comes under distribution while it is advancing This is one of the reasons so few people know how to recognize distribution selling Immediately following the first selling near the top a vacuum exists where volume may subside and the market averages will sell off for four days or so The second and probably the last early chance to recognize a top reversal is when the market attempts its first rally which it will always do after a number of days down from its highest point If this first attempt to bounce back follows through on the third fourth or fifth rally day either on decreased volume from the day before or if the market average recovers less than half of the initial drop from its former peak to the low the comeback is feeble and sputtering when it should be getting strong Frequently the first attempt at a rally during the beginning of a downtrend will fail abruptly Possibly after a oneday resurgence the second day will open up strong only to sell off toward the end of the day and suddenly close down After an advance in stocks for a couple of years the majority of the original price leaders will top and you can be fairly sure the overall market is going to get into trouble It is very important to pay attention to the way the leading stocks are acting RECOMMENDED LINKS Zacks wwwfreeforumcomcgibinmicrocgiofferZACKS codeBSH Self Starters wwwfreeforumcomcgibinmicrocgiofferDEANGE codeBSH Red

Expanded Business Description researchpdsebusdesFhtm Analyst Summary The entertainment industry has traditionally shown strong growth through all manner of economic downturn and periods of uncertainty When World War II started Major League Baseball had many of its stars go off to war and was considering canceling play until urged by President Roosevelt to continue because it was something that America needed During the Great Depression people found enough money to go to Movie Theaters because they could getaway for a while We believe that PDSE represents a value and in the long run an attractive takeover candidate Paradise has been very active in the last quarter constructing a foundation built on a renewed focus on certain highend niches in the music and entertainment industry and moves into certain fragmented highmargin markets We believe these activities will sustain growth in the months to come A renowned creative team and a new senior management team with extensive turnaround experience are keys to this success Given its price and performance we feel PDSE will be a solid play on the smallcap entertainment field Paradise Found Since the completion of the iball Media merger PDSE has made significant strides in focusing the Company on its strengths and expanding business To increase operating productivity and margins the new management team has concluded an extensive restructuring program that includes the shutdown of noncore Paradise businesses including the Digital Group the Commercial Group and elements of the Music Group The net result is to reduce revenue by and losses by and we believe to create a sustainable platform from which to grow the business profitably PDSE has previously disclosed that it has a going concern issue and has used up its operating cash As noted above they have also disclosed that they have discontinued of their operations because those operations were losing money and PDSE management felt those divisions had no strong growth prospects going forward Discontinuing those operations has dramatically reduced PDSEs losses and reduced cash burn In addition PDSE has just disclosed that it is currently negotiating a bridge financing and a million secured subordinated convertible debenture secured by all of the assets of PDSE and its subsidiaries subordinate only to any other senior debt We feel that the above investment represents the capital PDSE requires to continue to effectively launch its new strategy Due to economic conditions the current markets for the Companys traditional past products and services have shrunk dramatically and or shown flat growth this year However that same market environment has signaled a great deal of interest in the products and services that form the focus of the Companys new strategy PDSE will grow its remaining businesses and extend the energy visibility and commerce opportunities further into the broadcast festivalevent and online markets With select partners PDSE will be presenting festivals primetime cable and broadcast specials digital properties music and artist management initiatives film television projects and exclusive event properties for global brand partners In addition to growing its existing businesses PDSE is also examining a number of acquisitions in targeted markets which if completed will result in more rapid growth of the Company The Companys selection of future projects and acquisitions will be driven by ROI and strategic fit with existing business units PDSE will produce sponsortargeted entertainment leveraging music media events television commercials television programming and filmed entertainment to facilitate global branding campaigns Management expects this to provide a profitable multiplatform convergence of capabilities with multiple revenue streams and higher gross profit margins Music has become an even bigger part of getting the message across for many companies see this recent article in the NY Times wwwtheinvestoronlinecomresearchPDSEMusichtm o Paradise is a multifaceted entertainment company with an operating revenue platform stabilizing at million in annual revenue and a plan in place to grow quickly and profitably through internal project developments and targeted acquisitions o The Company is uniquely positioned to provide a musiccentric alternative to conventional delivery of the brand message for global brands o The market cap of the Company is less than million Paradise consists of a strong creative management team with proven accomplishments o The Company has just announced that it is negotiating a bridge financing and a M secured subordinated convertible debenture o The entertainment sector is projected to be strong and high margin for the foreseeable future o Managements strategy is to grow by acquisition both vertically and horizontally in the entertainment category and to create a lean edgy creative firm focused on providing premier sponsortargeted entertainment We estimate that PDSE will produce an EPS of for Excluding potential acquisitions we believe that PDSE is poised to grow by in and in when all elements are in place and operating at capacity we expect sharp revenue growth in excess of We also believe that in the short term the Company will stabilize revenues achieving a positive EBITDA in Q or Q of If PDSE is able to achieve the necessary financing we believe that several acquisitions will be made that build on the sound core that has been established achieving higher revenues and net earnings then currently estimated Technical Opinion The stock has made a new low with the weakness in overthecounter stocks but is now churning on high volume Since this low is near last years low with management expecting good things on the horizon for the Company the stock should find a bottom here The record high volume with little or no movement on also suggests a stalemate between buyers and sellers which could be another signal of a bottom The stock will meet overhead resistance between and If it can break up through look for it to retest before it reaches another major overhead level Note Although technical analysis is an important tool to determine the shortterm directional movement of securities technical analysis of stocks under is many times not as reliable as higher priced higher volume securities Fundamental Opinion PDSEs comparative financial analysis offers and suggests tremendous future stock price appreciation from current levels based on the Business Services industry comparative figures and even more conservatively the Services sector Assuming the market returns to bullish conditions and the Company meets projections provided by the Company and included in this report at sector values the stock could reach a and target price of and respectively This would represent a year gain of almost fold a twoyear gain of close to x and a threeyear total gain of almost x the investment Note To meet the suggested target prices the Company would have to trade at the Services sector multiples and the Company would have to achieve earnings and revenue estimates provided by management in this report A divergence either up or down from the projections could materially affect the target prices Financial Analysis researchpdseanalyFhtm Industry Market Profiles researchpdsemktprflFhtm Recent News
